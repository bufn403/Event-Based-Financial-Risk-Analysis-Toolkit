10,CPB,CAMPBELL SOUP CO,2023-09-21,"Risk Factors
In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although the risks are organized and described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. Business and Operational RisksWe may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs, such as raw and packaging materials, labor and distribution costs.As a manufacturer of food and beverage products, we rely on plant labor, distribution resources and raw and packaging materials including tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, dairy, vegetable oil, wheat, potatoes and other vegetables, steel, aluminum, glass, paper and resin. During 2023, we continued to experience significantly elevated commodity and supply chain costs including the costs of labor, raw materials, energy, fuel, packaging materials and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products. As 2023 progressed, we experienced some moderation in input cost inflation, and we expect modestly elevated levels of inflation to continue into 2024. In addition, many of these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, pandemic illness (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical conflicts (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), environmental and other sustainability regulations and other factors that may be beyond our control. We try to mitigate some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn or times of increased inflationary pressure. To the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely 6 manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume or a shift in sales mix to lower-margin offerings, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to fully offset any cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business.Our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors. This damage or disruption could result from execution issues, as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as increased temperatures due to climate change, water stress, extreme weather events, natural disasters, product or raw material scarcity, fire, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical conflicts (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), strikes, labor shortages, cybersecurity breaches, government shutdowns, disruptions in logistics, supplier capacity constraints or other events. Commodity prices continue to be volatile and have generally increased. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.Deterioration of global macroeconomic conditions, including economic recession or periods of higher inflation in key markets may adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products.Global macroeconomic conditions can be uncertain and volatile. We have in the past been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by changes in global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, global supply chain challenges, labor shortages, geopolitical conflicts (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and growing recession risk. Volatility in financial markets and deterioration of global macroeconomic conditions could impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to, the following:•higher commodity prices and other increased input costs could continue due to supply chain shortages or supply chain disruptions, which may not be sufficiently mitigated by our current commodity contracts;•the failure of third parties on which we rely, including but not limited to, those that supply our packaging, ingredients, equipment and other necessary operating materials, co-manufacturers and independent contractors, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so;•a shift in consumer spending during periods of economic uncertainty or inflation that could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products;•a change in demand for or availability of our products, as a result of retailers, distributors, or carriers modifying their inventory, fulfillment or shipping practices; •a disruption to our distribution capabilities or our distribution channels, including those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors; and•future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact our liquidity or increase costs of borrowing; These and other impacts of global macroeconomic conditions could also heighten many of the other risk factors discussed in this Item 1A. Our sensitivity to global macroeconomic conditions could materially impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property in traditional retail and digital environments. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results.Competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and 7 key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results.Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.We have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging, ingredients, or our environmental, social, human capital or governance practices, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. In addition, we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts, anticipate consumer preferences, or invest sufficiently in maintaining our brand image. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.We may be adversely impacted by a disruption, failure or security breach of our information technology systems.Our information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage our data, communications and business processes, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, procurement, supply chain, customer service, accounting and administrative functions and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to an increase in our employees working remotely. If we do not obtain and effectively manage the resources and materials necessary to build, sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems are subject to attack or other security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer, employee or other confidential information), service disruptions or other system failures. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches, disruptions or failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs, ransomware payments and/or penalties under various data protection laws and regulations.To address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies, cyber insurance, employee awareness training, and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems. We believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks, however, cyber threats are constantly evolving, are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated and are being made by groups of individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Additionally, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. We have experienced threats and breaches to our data and systems and although we have not experienced a breach that had a material impact on our operations or business, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident. For example, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, we identified unauthorized activity on some of our information technology systems. Upon detecting the attack, we took immediate action to investigate, contain and remediate the threat, retaining the services of leading third-party cybersecurity experts and contacting federal law enforcement. The incident had a limited impact on our business operations and was not material to the company's results of operations or financial condition.  In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. We may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents. As cyberattacks increase in frequency and magnitude around the world, we may be unable to obtain cyber insurance in the amounts and on the terms we view as appropriate and favorable for our operations.In addition, in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. Our information security program includes capabilities designed to evaluate and mitigate cyber risks arising from third-party service providers. We believe that these capabilities provide insights and visibility to the security posture of our third-party service providers, however, cyber threats to those organizations are beyond our control. If these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted.8 We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.We depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals, including all levels of skilled labor in our manufacturing facilities. We also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Over the past few years, we have experienced an increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected.If we do not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives, our profitability could suffer.Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of volatile cost inputs. We continuously pursue initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives"" for additional information on these initiatives. We also regularly pursue cost productivity initiatives in procurement, manufacturing and logistics. Any failure or delay in implementing our initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our ability to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations and could adversely affect our business. If we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. Our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions.We have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future. Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms, obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions. Potential risks also include:•the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner, including implementation of enterprise-resource planning systems;•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•potential loss of key employees, co-manufacturers, suppliers and/or customers of acquired businesses;•assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;•the inability to achieve anticipated benefits, including revenues or other operating results; •operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected;•the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment; and•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience.In addition, we have previously made strategic divestitures and may do so in the future. Any businesses we decide to divest in the future may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. Potential risks of divestitures may also include:•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•loss of key suppliers and/or customers of divested businesses;•the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations; and•the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs.9 If we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of future acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.Competitive and Industry RisksWe face significant competition in all our product categories, which may result in lower sales and margins.We operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the North American market and experience competition in all of our categories. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. A number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a continued shift towards private label offerings, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or significant inflation, could result in us reducing prices and/or increasing promotions, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share, each of which may result in lower sales and margins. Our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. There are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. If we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. Weak economic conditions, recessions, significant inflation and other factors, such as pandemics, could effect consumer preferences and demand. In addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. As such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories. Finally, if we fail to rapidly develop products in faster-growing and more profitable categories, we could experience reduced demand for our products, or fail to expand margins. We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers.Our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. We expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future. These alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. In addition, retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers. These customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products, which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. In 2023, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 22% of our consolidated net sales. There can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities, or on the same terms as in the past. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results.Financial and Economic RisksAn impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth. As of July 30, 2023, we had goodwill of $3.965 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2.541 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions were to 10 change, we may be required in the future to record impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth.We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans.We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations, future funding requirements, or net periodic benefit costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.We face risks related to heightened inflation, recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions.Customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. For instance in 2023, the U.S. experienced significantly heightened inflationary pressures which we expect to continue into 2024. We may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of inflation through continued price increases, productivity initiatives and cost savings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We implemented a series of price increases in the last year in response to inflationary pressures, and although price elasticities have remained below historical levels this may not continue and result in lower sales in 2024. In addition, if the U.S. economy enters a recession in 2024, we may experience sales declines and may have to decrease prices, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, economic disruptions or other reasons, may adversely impact us.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claims.We are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings. Since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. In particular, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations, including claims relating to the presence of heavy metals in food products. Additionally, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used in our Snacks segment, has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny. Our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years. In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue).Increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial results.The manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. Various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including but not limited to the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Governmental and administrative bodies within the U.S. are considering a variety of tax, trade and other regulatory reforms. Trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products. We regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and, consequently, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data 11 security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. There is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts, serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, or an increased focus regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results. We may suffer losses if changes to regulations require us to change the ingredients we use or how we process, package, transport, store, distribute, advertise, or label our products. Moreover, depending on the implementation of such regulatory changes, we could have increased risk for a product recall or have existing inventory become unsellable, which could materially and adversely impact our product sales, financial condition and operating results.If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputation.We have in the past and we may, in the future, need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as wheat, tomatoes and potatoes. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of storing and transporting our raw materials, or disrupt production schedules. We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The physical effects and transitional costs of climate change and the legal, regulatory or market initiatives to address climate change could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon pricing, cap and trade systems or a carbon tax), energy policies, and sustainability. Increased compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change and additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change that are designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the running of our manufacturing facilities and our business, as well as increase distribution and supply chain costs. Moreover, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes in our business operations and strategy, which will likely require us to devote substantial time and attention to these matters and cause us to incur additional costs. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our business is subject to an increasing focus on sustainability matters.From time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments, including reducing our impact on the environment and relating to animal welfare. For example, in 2022, we established science-based targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements, the pace of changes in technology, the availability of requisite financing, the availability of suppliers and products that can meet our sustainability and other standards, 12 and changing business dynamics including acquisitions. Furthermore, standards for tracking and reporting such matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. Methodologies for reporting these data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations (including from acquisitions and divestitures), and other changes in circumstances, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. If we fail to achieve, or are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving, or improperly report our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments, it could negatively affect consumer or customer preference for our products or investor confidence in our stock, as well as expose us to enforcement actions and litigation.Additionally, we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media, stockholders, activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters or animal welfare goals. Such failure, or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly regarding climate change or animal welfare, whether or not valid, could result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business and reputation.Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Furthermore, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, and European Union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Although we have no operations in Russia or Ukraine, we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw material due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy. The scope and duration of the military conflict in Ukraine is uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the military conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply disruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain. In addition, the effects of the ongoing conflict could also heighten many of the other risk factors discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Related to the Pending Sovos Brands AcquisitionThe Sovos Brands acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, could delay closing or prevent it from occurring at all.The closing of the Sovos Brands acquisition is subject to certain customary mutual conditions, including (i) the absence of any injunction or other order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or applicable law or legal prohibition in the United States that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger, (ii) the approval of Sovos Brands’ shareholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Sovos Brands common stock entitled to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and (iii) the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. If the closing of the acquisition is not effective by May 7, 2024, we could be required to pay an additional $0.00182 per share per day beginning May 8, 2024 until the merger becomes effective. We and Sovos Brands may also terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances, and we may be required, in certain circumstances, to pay a termination fee of $145 million. For additional information on the merger agreement, see our Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 7, 2023. There are also several pending lawsuits filed by purported shareholders of Sovos Brands seeking, among other things, to enjoin the acquisition. If we do not complete the acquisition, or if the closing is significantly delayed, our business or financial results may be adversely affected.Our obligation to complete the pending acquisition of Sovos Brands is not subject to a financing condition, and financing for the Sovos Brands acquisition may not be obtained on favorable terms, or at all.Our obligation to complete the pending acquisition of Sovos Brands is not subject to a financing condition. We intend to finance the acquisition of Sovos Brands with the issuance of new debt. There can be no assurance that we will obtain financing on terms we find acceptable and we may be required to finance a portion of the purchase price of the pending acquisition at interest rates higher than currently expected. Limitations on our ability to obtain financing, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs may adversely affect our business or financial results.The anticipated benefits of the Sovos Brands acquisition may not be fully realized.We expect that the acquisition of Sovos Brands will result in various benefits including, among other things, cost savings, cost synergies and revenue opportunities. Achieving these anticipated benefits is subject to uncertainties, including whether we integrate in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Integrating Sovos Brands will be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. We may experience unanticipated difficulties or expenses related to the integration, including:13 • diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns;• managing a larger combined business;• perceived adverse changes in product offerings to consumers, whether or not these changes actually occur;• assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;• the retention of key suppliers and customers of Sovos Brands;• attracting new business and operational relationships;• retaining and integrating key employees and maintaining employee morale; and• unforeseen expenses or delays.After the acquisition, we may seek to combine certain operations, functions, systems and processes, which we may be unsuccessful or delayed in implementing. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the Sovos Brands acquisition, transaction costs, acquisition-related costs, costs for synergies and integration costs may be more than anticipated. In addition, there are many factors beyond our control and the control of Sovos Brands that could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. The failure to effectively address any of these risks, or any other risks related to the integration of the Sovos Brands acquisition, may adversely affect our business or financial results"

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although the risks are organized and described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. Business and Operational RisksWe may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs, such as raw and packaging materials, labor and distribution costsAs a manufacturer of food and beverage products, we rely on plant labor, distribution resources and raw and packaging materials including tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, dairy, vegetable oil, wheat, potatoes and other vegetables, steel, aluminum, glass, paper and resin. During 2022, we experienced significantly elevated commodity and supply chain costs including the costs of labor, raw materials, energy, fuel, packaging materials and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products, and we expect elevated levels of inflation to continue in 2023. In addition, many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, pandemic illness (such as the 6 COVID-19 pandemic), armed hostilities (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine) and other factors that may be beyond our control. We try to mitigate some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn or times of increased inflationary pressure. To the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to fully offset any cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our businessOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors. This damage or disruption could result from execution issues, as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as increased temperatures due to climate change, water stress, extreme weather events, natural disasters, product or raw material scarcity, fire, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), armed hostilities (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), strikes, labor shortages, cybersecurity breaches, government shutdowns, disruptions in logistics, supplier capacity constraints or other events. Commodity prices continue to be volatile and generally increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and labor and transportation shortages. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.We have experienced temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented employee safety measures, which exceed guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization, across all our supply chain facilities. Even with these measures, and the availability of vaccines, given the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, there is continued risk that COVID-19 may spread through our workforce. Illness, labor shortages, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs. Short-term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.The COVID-19 pandemic and related ongoing implications could adversely impact our business and results of operations The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on financial markets, economic conditions, and portions of our industry as a result of changes in consumer behavior, retailer inventory levels, cost inflation, manufacturing and supply chain disruption, vaccination rates and effectiveness, and overall macroeconomic conditions. Although our business has benefited from increased at-home consumption due to COVID-19, our ability to sustain heightened sales is dependent on consumer purchasing behavior. The continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines may partially mitigate the risks around the continued spread of COVID-19, however, with the spread of the COVID-19 variants, the ongoing implications of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to:•a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution facilities, or disruption in our supply chain, including but not limited to, as a result of illness, labor shortages, government restrictions or other workforce disruptions; •the failure of third parties on which we rely, including but not limited to, those that supply our packaging, ingredients, equipment and other necessary operating materials, co-manufacturers and independent contractors, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so; 7 •a strain on our supply chain, which could result from short-term or sustained changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns that increase demand at our retail customers and exceed our production capacity for our products; •continued volatility in commodity and other input costs, which may not be sufficiently offset by our commodity hedging activities; •a disruption to our distribution capabilities or to our distribution channels, including those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors;•new or escalated government or regulatory responses in markets where we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, or in the markets of third parties on which we rely, could prevent or disrupt our business operations;•a significant portion of our workforce, including our management team, could become unable to work as a result of illness, or the attention of our management team could be diverted if key employees become ill and become unable to work; •a change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers, distributors, or carriers modifying their inventory, fulfillment or shipping practices;•an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to, among other things, reduced in-store visits and travel restrictions;•a shift in consumer spending during periods of economic uncertainty or inflation could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products; and •additional business disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives.These and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included in this Item 1A. The ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations.Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increasesLabor is a primary component of operating our business. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, and other government regulations. During 2022, we observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, caused by the continued spread of COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck. Reduced availability of trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brandsWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results.Competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results.8 Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brandsWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.We may be adversely impacted by a disruption, failure or security breach of our information technology systemsOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage our data, communications and business processes, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, procurement, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to an increase in our employees working remotely. If we do not obtain and effectively manage the resources and materials necessary to build, sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems are subject to attack or other security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer, employee or other confidential information), service disruptions or other system failures. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches, disruptions or failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs, ransomware payments and/or penalties under various data protection laws and regulations.To address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies, cyber insurance, employee awareness training, and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems. We believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks, however, cyber threats are constantly evolving, are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated and are being made by groups of individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Additionally, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. We have experienced threats to our data and systems and although we have not experienced a material incident to date, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident. We may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents. In addition, in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. Our information security program includes capabilities designed to evaluate and mitigate cyber risks arising from third-party service providers. We believe that these capabilities provide insights and visibility to the security posture of our third-party service providers, however, cyber threats to those organizations are beyond our control. If these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted.We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our businessWe depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. If we do not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives, our profitability could suffer Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of volatile cost inputs. We continuously 9 pursue initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives"" for additional information on these initiatives. We also regularly pursue cost productivity initiatives in procurement, manufacturing and logistics. Any failure or delay in implementing our initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our ability to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations and could adversely affect our business. If we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. Our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactionsWe have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future. Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms, obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions. Potential risks also include:•the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner, including implementation of enterprise-resource planning systems;•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•potential loss of key employees, suppliers and/or customers of acquired businesses;•assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;•the inability to achieve anticipated benefits, including revenues or other operating results; •operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected;•the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment; and•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience.In addition, we have previously made strategic divestitures and may do so in the future. Any businesses we decide to divest in the future may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. Potential risks of divestitures may also include:•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•loss of key suppliers and/or customers of divested businesses;•the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations; and•the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs.If we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of future acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.Competitive and Industry RisksWe face significant competition in all our product categories, which may result in lower sales and marginsWe operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the North American market and experience competition in all of our categories. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. A number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a continued shift towards private label offerings, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or significant inflation, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share, each of which may result in lower sales and margins. 10 Our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. There are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. If we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. Weak economic conditions, recessions, significant inflation and other factors, such as pandemics, could effect consumer preferences and demand. In addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. As such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered, and in some cases, delayed product innovation efforts. Finally, if we fail to rapidly develop products in faster-growing and more profitable categories, we could experience reduced demand for our products, or fail to expand margins. We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customersOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. We expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future. These alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. In addition, retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers. These customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products, which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. In 2022, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 22% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations. There can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities, or on the same terms as in the past. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results.Financial and Economic RisksAn impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth As of July 31, 2022, we had goodwill of $3.979 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2.549 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, we may be required in the future to record impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth.We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plansWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations, future funding requirements, or net periodic benefit costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.11 We face risks related to heightened inflation, recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. For instance in 2022, the U.S. experienced significantly heightened inflationary pressures which we expect to continue into 2023. We may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of inflation through price increases, productivity initiatives and cost savings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, if the U.S. economy enters a recession in 2023, we may experience sales declines and may have to decrease prices, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, economic disruptions or other reasons, may adversely impact us.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claimsWe are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings. Since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. In particular, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations, including claims relating to the presence of heavy metals in food products. Additionally, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used in our Snacks segment, has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny. Our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years. In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue).Increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial resultsThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. Various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including but not limited to the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Governmental and administrative bodies within the U.S. are considering a variety of tax, trade and other regulatory reforms. Trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products. We regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and, consequently, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. There is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts, serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results. If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputationWe have in the past and we may, in the future, need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers. A 12 widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operationsThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, cashews and almonds. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of storing and transporting our raw materials, or disrupt production schedules. We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. There is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies, and sustainability. Increased compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change and additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change or designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the running of our manufacturing facilities and our business, as well as increase distribution and supply chain costs. Moreover, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes in our business operations and strategy, which will likely require us to devote substantial time and attention to these matters and cause us to incur additional costs. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Additionally, we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media, stockholders, activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. Such failure, or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly regarding climate change, whether or not valid, could result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business and reputation. Moreover, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments, including to reduce our impact on the environment. For example, in 2022, we established science-based targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements, the pace of changes in technology, the availability of requisite financing and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards. If we fail to achieve, or are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving, or improperly report our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments, it could negatively affect consumer preference for our products or investor confidence in our stock, as well as expose us to enforcement actions and litigation. Actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our businessWe were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019. If a new activist investor purchased our stock, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and strategic partners, and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Furthermore, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, and European Union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Although we have no operations in Russia or 13 Ukraine, we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw material due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy. The scope and duration of the military conflict in Ukraine is uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the military conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply disruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain"
11,CPB,CAMPBELL SOUP CO,2021-09-23,"Risk Factors
In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. 6 Business and Operational RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic and related ongoing implications could adversely impact our business and results of operations The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on financial markets, economic conditions, and portions of our industry as a result of changes in consumer behavior, retailer inventory levels, cost inflation, manufacturing and supply chain disruption, and overall macroeconomic conditions. Although our business has benefited from increased at-home consumption due to restrictions related to COVID-19, our ability to sustain heightened sales is dependent on consumer purchasing behavior. The continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines may partially mitigate the risks around the continued spread of COVID-19, however, with the spread of the COVID-19 variants, the ongoing implications of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to:•a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution facilities, or disruption in our supply chain, including but not limited to, as a result of illness, labor shortages, government restrictions or other workforce disruptions; •the failure of third parties on which we rely, including but not limited to, those that supply our packaging, ingredients, equipment and other necessary operating materials, co-manufacturers and independent contractors, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so; •a strain on our supply chain, which could result from short-term or sustained changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns that increase demand at our retail customers and exceed our production capacity for our products; •continued volatility in commodity and other input costs, which may not be sufficiently offset by our commodity hedging activities; •a disruption to our distribution capabilities or to our distribution channels, including those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors;•new or escalated government or regulatory responses in markets where we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, or in the markets of third parties on which we rely, could prevent or disrupt our business operations;•a significant portion of our workforce, including our management team, could become unable to work as a result of illness, or the attention of our management team could be diverted if key employees become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work; •a change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers, distributors, or carriers modifying their inventory, fulfillment or shipping practices;•an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to, among other things, reduced in-store visits and travel restrictions;•a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products; and •continued business disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and productivity initiatives on the original timelines.These and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included below in this Item 1A. The ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations.If we do not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives, our profitability could suffer Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of volatile cost inputs. We are pursuing multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. These initiatives require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives, including the integration of Snyder's-Lance in an efficient and effective manner. In some respects, our plans to achieve these cost savings 7 continue to be refined. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives"" for additional information on these initiatives. We also regularly pursue cost productivity initiatives. In addition, we have recently initiated a process to drive operational excellence by transforming our supply chain capabilities to build a more resilient and agile supply chain to serve our evolving business needs while enhancing efficiency. These initiatives are focused on cost savings and productivity opportunities in procurement, manufacturing and logistics. Any failure or delaying in implementing our initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our ability to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations and could adversely affect our business. We may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs, such as raw and packaging materials, labor and distribution costsAs a manufacturer of food and beverage products, we rely on plant labor, distribution resources and raw and packaging materials including tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, dairy, potatoes and other vegetables, steel, aluminum, glass, paper and resin. In the later part of 2021 and the early part of 2022, the costs of such labor, raw materials, energy, fuel, packaging materials and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased. In addition, many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, pandemic illness (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other factors that may be beyond our control. Although we are unable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2022. We also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022.We try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn. To the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our businessOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors. This damage or disruption could result from execution issues, as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as increased temperatures due to climate change, water stress, extreme weather events, natural disasters, product or raw material scarcity, fire, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes, labor shortages, cybersecurity breaches, government shutdowns, disruptions in logistics, supplier capacity constraints or other events. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile during the COVID-19 pandemic. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.We have experienced temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented employee safety measures, which exceed guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization, across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, enhanced sanitation, social distancing, mask use, plexiglass dividers, and temperature screenings. Even with these measures, and the availability of vaccines, given the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, there is continued risk that COVID-19 may spread through our workforce. Illness, labor shortages, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs. Short-term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.8 Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increasesLabor is a primary component of operating our business. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date, we have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck. Reduced availability of trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brandsWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results.Competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results.Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brandsWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.We may be adversely impacted by a disruption, failure or security breach of our information technology systemsOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage our data, communications and business processes, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, procurement, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to an increase in our employees working remotely. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems are subject to attack or other security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer, employee or other confidential information), service disruptions or other system failures. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches, disruptions or failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs, ransomware payments and/or penalties under various data protection laws and regulations.To address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies, cyber insurance, employee training, and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems. We believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks, however, cyber threats are constantly evolving, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups of individuals with a wide range of expertise and 9 motives, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We have experienced threats to our data and systems and although we have not experienced a material incident to date, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident. We may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents. In addition, in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted.We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our businessWe depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactionsWe have historically made strategic acquisition of brands and businesses and we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future. Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms, obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions. Potential risks also include:•the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner, including implementation of enterprise-resource planning systems;•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•potential loss of key employees, suppliers and/or customers of acquired businesses;•assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;•the inability to achieve anticipated benefits, including revenues or other operating results; •operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected;•the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment; and•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience.In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business, and we may undertake other divestitures in the future. Any other businesses we decide to divest in the future may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. Potential risks of divestitures may also include:•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•loss of key suppliers and/or customers of divested businesses;•the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations; and•the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs.If we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of future acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.10 Competitive and Industry RisksWe face significant competition in all our product categories, which may result in lower sales and marginsWe operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the North American market and experience competition in all of our categories. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. A number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a continued shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share, each of which may result in lower sales and margins. Our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. There are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. If we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. In addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. As such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered, and in some cases, delayed product innovation efforts. Finally, if we fail to rapidly develop products in faster-growing and more profitable categories, we could experience reduced demand for our products, or fail to expand margins. We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customersOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. We expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future. These alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. In addition, retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers. These customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products, which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. In 2021, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 46% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 21% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations. There can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities, or on the same terms as in the past. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results.Financial and Economic RisksAn impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth As of August 1, 2021, we had goodwill of $3,981 million and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2,549 million. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. We have experienced impairment charges in prior years. See ""Significant Accounting Estimates"" and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on such impairments. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, we may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the 11 carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth.We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plansWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.We face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, economic disruptions or other reasons, may adversely impact us.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claimsWe are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings. Since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. In particular, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations, including claims relating to the presence of heavy metals in food products. Additionally, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used by Pepperidge Farm and Snyder’s-Lance, has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny. Our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years. In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue). Furthermore, actions we have taken or may take, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us.Increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial resultsThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. Various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including but not limited to the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Governmental and administrative bodies within the U.S. are considering a variety of tax, trade and other regulatory reforms. Trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products. We regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and, consequently, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. There is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts, serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or 12 regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results. If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputationWe have in the past and we may, in the future, need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operationsThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, cashews and almonds. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of storing and transporting our raw materials, or disrupt production schedules.We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change may also result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change, including, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives, including single use plastics. In the event such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency and other sustainability goals, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of utility providers, fuel emissions, or fuel suppliers could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. Additionally, consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made, requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our businessWe were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019. If a new activist investor purchased our stock, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and strategic partners, and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation"
15,CPB,CAMPBELL SOUP CO,2020-09-24,"Risk Factors
In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. Operational Risk Factors
The outbreak of COVID-19 and associated responses could adversely impact our business and results of operations The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets throughout the world. In response, governmental authorities have implemented numerous measures in an attempt to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. Although our business has benefitted from some of these measures, the impact and associated responses of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to:•a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution facilities, or disruption in our supply chain, including but not limited to, as a result of illness, government restrictions or other workforce disruptions; •the failure of third parties on which we rely, including but not limited to, those that supply our packaging, ingredients, equipment and other necessary operating materials, co-manufacturers and independent contractors, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so; •a strain on our supply chain, which could result from continued increased retailer and consumer demand for our products;•a disruption to our distribution capabilities or to our distribution channels, including those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors;•reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as we prioritize the production of other products due to increased demand;•new or escalated government or regulatory responses in markets where we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, or in the markets of third parties on which we rely, could prevent or disrupt our business operations;•continued commodity cost volatility, which may not be sufficiently offset by our commodity hedging activities;•a significant portion of our workforce, including our management team, could become unable to work as a result of illness, or the attention of our management team could be diverted if key employees become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work; •higher costs in certain areas such as front-line employee compensation and independent contractor payments, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees and product quality standards, which could continue or could increase in these or other areas;•the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship; or decrease in demand due to the easing of governmental authority restrictions and business closings; or decrease in pantry-loading activity;•a change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers, distributors, or carriers modifying their inventory, fulfillment or shipping practices;•an inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer shopping habits due to, among other things, reduced in-store visits and travel restrictions;•a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or lower price products; •an increased reliance on our information technology systems due to many employees working remotely causing us to be increasingly subject to cyberattack;•a continued decrease in demand at restaurants or other away from home dining establishments resulting from government restrictions and social distancing measures, which adversely affects our foodservice business; and •continued business disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and productivity initiatives on the original timelines.6 These and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included below in this Item 1A. The ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations.We face significant competition in all our product categories, which may result in lower sales and marginsWe operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the North American market and experience competition in all of our categories. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. A number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a continued shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share, each of which may result in lower sales and margins. Our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. There are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. If we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. In addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. As such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered, and in some cases, delayed product innovation efforts. Finally, if we fail to rapidly develop products in faster-growing and more profitable categories, we could experience reduced demand for our products, or fail to expand margins. We may not achieve our targeted cost savings, which may adversely affect our ability to grow marginsWe are pursuing multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. These initiatives require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives, including the integration of Snyder's-Lance in an efficient and effective manner. In some respects, our plans to achieve these cost savings continue to be refined. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives"" for additional information on these initiatives. We have recently delayed the implementation of system upgrades and certain other cost-saving and productivity initiatives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our cost savings and productivity initiatives on the same timelines. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often complex initiatives. Any failure to or delay in implementing our initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our ability to grow margins.We may not be able to increase prices to fully offset increases in prices of raw and packaging materials or distribution costsAs a manufacturer of food and beverage products, the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, dairy, potatoes and other vegetables, steel, aluminum, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, pandemic illness (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other factors that may be beyond our control. Despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet increased demand for our products, certain ingredients and packaging, including steel, aluminum, glass, agricultural products, proteins and other commodities have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2021. The cost of distribution decreased in 2020 due to a decline in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess availability, warehousing efficiencies and lower fuel costs, however, we have experienced a recent increase in 7 transportation and logistics costs. We may not be able to offset any price increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity. We try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn. To the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customersOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. We expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future. These alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. In addition, retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs and customized products funded by their suppliers. These customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products, which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. In 2020, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 21% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations. In addition, The Kroger Co. and its affiliates accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2020. There can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities, or on the same terms as in the past. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results. Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brandsWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our businessOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors. This damage or disruption could result from execution issues, as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as increased temperatures due to climate change, water stress, extreme weather events, natural disasters, product or raw material scarcity, fire, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes, cybersecurity breaches, government shutdowns, disruptions in logistics, supplier capacity constraints or other events. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile during the COVID-19 pandemic. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.We have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented employee safety measures, which exceed guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 8 and World Health Organization, across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, enhanced sanitation, social distancing, mask use, plexiglass dividers, and temperature screenings. Even with these measures, there is risk that COVID-19 may spread through our workforce. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs.We experienced increased demand for our products in the second half of 2020. Short-term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We are actively monitoring the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing impact on our supply chain and operations, however we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities.If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputationWe have in the past and we may, in the future, need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category.An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth As of August 2, 2020, we had goodwill of $3,986 million and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2,611 million. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. We have experienced impairment charges in prior years. See ""Significant Accounting Estimates"" and Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on such impairments. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, we may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth.Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brandsWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. Competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results. 9 We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plansWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.We may be adversely impacted by a failure or security breach of our information technology systemsOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage our data, communications and business processes, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, procurement, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems are subject to attack or other security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer, employee or other confidential information), service disruptions or other system failures. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches, disruptions or failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data protection laws and regulations. To address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies, cyber insurance, employee training, and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems. We believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks. Although we have not experienced a material incident to date, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident. The cost to remediate damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant.In addition, in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted. We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business We depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. We also recently streamlined our business into a two-division operating model, which could lead to operational challenges and higher employee turnover. Our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactionsWe have historically made strategic acquisition of brands and businesses and we may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future. Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms, obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions. Potential risks also include:•the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner, including implementation of enterprise-resource planning systems;•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•potential loss of key employees, suppliers and/or customers of acquired businesses;•assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;10 •the inability to achieve anticipated benefits, including revenues or other operating results; •operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected; •the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment; and•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. In addition, during the first half of 2020, we completed the sale of our Kelsen business and the Arnott’s and other international operations, and we may undertake other divestitures in the future. Any other businesses we decide to divest in the future may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. Potential risks of divestitures may also include:•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•loss of key suppliers and/or customers of divested businesses;•the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations; and•the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs.If we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of future acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.Market Conditions and Other General Risk Factors
We face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets, the risk of which has been heightened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like, and our borrowing costs could increase. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets. We may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, economic disruptions or other reasons, may adversely impact us.The administering regulatory authority regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of December 2021. Our variable rate debt and revolving credit facility use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. While we expect to have paid off our variable-rate debt and replaced or renegotiated our revolving credit facility by the end of December 2021, we may incur additional indebtedness and/or negotiate new credit terms that will rely on an alternative interest rate method to LIBOR. Any legal or regulatory changes made in response to LIBOR’s future discontinuance may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR, or changes in the rules or methodologies in LIBOR. In addition, alternative methods to LIBOR may not yet have been established by the end of December 2021, and the impact of such alternative methods may be impossible or impracticable to determine. While we do not expect that the transition from LIBOR and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, it is still uncertain at this time.Actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business We were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019. If a new activist investor purchased our stock, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and other strategic partners, and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.11 Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors
We may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claimsWe are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings. Since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. In particular, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Additionally, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used by Pepperidge Farm and Snyder’s-Lance, has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny. Our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years. In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue). Furthermore, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us.Increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial resultsThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. Various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including but not limited to the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Governmental and administrative bodies within the U.S. are considering a variety of tax, trade and other regulatory reforms. Trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products. We regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and, consequently, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. There is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts, serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results"
6,CPB,CAMPBELL SOUP CO,2019-09-26,"Risk Factors
In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. Operational Risk Factors
We face significant competition in all our product categories, which may result in lower sales and marginsWe operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry mainly in the North American market and experience competition in all of our categories. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. A number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a continued shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share, each of which may result in lower sales and margins. Our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. There are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. If we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. In addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. As such, we must be successful in developing innovative products across a multitude of product categories. Finally, if we fail to rapidly develop products in faster-growing and more profitable categories, we could experience reduced demand for our products, or fail to expand margins. Our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of divestituresDuring the first half of 2020, we expect to complete the sale of our Arnott’s and international operations and use the net proceeds from this divestiture to reduce debt. Our ability to successfully divest this business depends upon, among other things, receiving all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. In addition, any other businesses we decide to divest may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. Potential risks of divestitures may also include diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, loss of key suppliers and/or customers of divested businesses, the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. If we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of planned and/or future divestitures, we may not be able to reduce our debt as planned and our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.We may be adversely impacted by our substantial indebtednessWe used the net proceeds from the businesses we sold in 2019 to reduce our debt and expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of Campbell International to further reduce debt. However, as of July 28, 2019, we maintained approximately $8.7 billion of indebtedness, and this level of indebtedness may have important consequences to our business, including but not limited to:•increasing the possibility of a downgrade in our credit rating; •increasing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates;•subjecting us to new financial and other covenants;•increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including undertaking significant capital projects;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and•restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities, including other acquisitions.In addition, we regularly access the commercial paper markets for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. If our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty selling additional debt securities or borrowing money in the amounts and on the terms that might be available if our credit ratings were maintained. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 6 Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources"" for additional information regarding our indebtedness.Disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets may also reduce the amount of commercial paper that we can issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms we find acceptable. Limitations on our ability to access the capital markets, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs may adversely affect our business and financial results.We may not achieve our targeted cost savings, which may adversely affect our ability to grow marginsWe are pursuing multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $850 million for continuing operations by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. These initiatives require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives, including the integration of Snyder's-Lance in an efficient and effective manner. In some respects, our plans to achieve these cost savings continue to be refined. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives"" for additional information on these initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often complex initiatives. Any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our ability to grow margins.We may not be able to increase prices to fully offset increases in the cost of transportation and logistics and prices of raw and packaging materials The cost of distribution has increased recently due to a rise in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess demand, reduced availability and higher fuel costs. In addition, certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products, including steel, have been or may be impacted by tariffs.As a manufacturer of food and beverage products, the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, dairy, potatoes and other vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control. We may not be able to offset any price increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity. We try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customersOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. We expect this trend away from traditional retail grocery to alternate channels to continue in the future. These alternative retail channels may also create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. In addition, retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers. These customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products, which are generally sold at lower prices than branded products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. In 2019, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 43% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations. In addition, The Kroger Co. and its affiliates accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2019. There can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities, or on the same terms as in the past. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results. 7 Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brandsWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our businessOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors. This damage or disruption could result from execution issues, as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as product or raw material scarcity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, cybersecurity breaches, government shutdowns, disruptions in logistics, supplier capacity constraints or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputationWe have in the past and we may, in the future, need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes sickness or injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category.An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth As of July 28, 2019, we had goodwill of $4.678 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2.753 billion, of which a total of $785 million relates to Campbell International and has been included in Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. We have, in the most recently completed and prior years, experienced impairment charges. See ""Significant Accounting Estimates"" and Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent impairments. We may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth.Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brandsWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect 8 our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. Competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results. We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plansWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.We may be adversely impacted by a failure or security breach of our information technology systemsOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage our data, communications and business processes, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, procurement, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attack or other security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential information), service disruptions or other system failures. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches, disruptions or failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data protection laws and regulations. To address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies, cyber insurance, employee training, and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems. We believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks. Although we have not experienced a material incident to date, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident. The cost to remediate damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant.In addition, in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted. We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business We depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We also compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. We also recently streamlined our business into a two-division operating model, which could lead to operational challenges and higher employee turnover. Our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactionsWe may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms, obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions. Potential risks also include:•the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner;•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;9 •potential loss of key employees, suppliers and/or customers of acquired businesses;•assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;•the inability to achieve anticipated benefits, including revenues or other operating results; •operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected; •the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment; and•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. Market Conditions and Other General Risk Factors
Actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business We were the target of activist shareholder activities in 2019. If these activities continue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and other strategic partners, and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.We face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, economic disruptions or other reasons, may adversely impact us.The administering regulatory authority announced it intends to phase out London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) by the end of 2021. Our variable rate debt and revolving credit facility use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. While we expect to have paid off our variable-rate debt and replaced or renegotiated our revolving credit facility by the end of 2021, we plan to incur additional indebtedness and/or negotiate new terms that will rely on an alternative method to LIBOR. Any legal or regulatory changes made in response to LIBOR’s future discontinuance may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR, or changes in the rules or methodologies in LIBOR. In addition, alternative methods to LIBOR may be impossible or impracticable to determine. While we do not expect that the transition from LIBOR and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, it is still uncertain at this time. Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors
We may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claimsWe are a party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reportable legal proceedings. Since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. In particular, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Additionally, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used by Pepperidge Farm and Snyder’s-Lance, has also come under increased regulatory scrutiny. Our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various class and individual lawsuits in recent years. In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue).Increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial resultsThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. Various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including but not limited to the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. 10 Governmental and administrative bodies within the U.S. are considering a variety of tax, trade and other regulatory reforms. Trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products. Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts, serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results"
9,CPB,CAMPBELL SOUP CO,2018-09-27,"Risk Factors
In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. 5 Operational Risk Factors
Our strategy may not be successful and our business or financial results may be adversely impacted On August 30, 2018, we announced our vision to be a leading snacks and simple meals company, with a portfolio of best-in-class products and brands in our core North American market. This strategy entails a refocused portfolio that includes brands concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional retail grocery channels. Factors that may impact our success include our ability to:•capture increased market share in certain snacking and simple meals categories, while maintaining our leading market share in other categories;•identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends;•design and implement effective retail execution plans;•design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs, including digital programs; and•secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers. If we are not successful in addressing these factors, or if there are changes in the underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete, our strategy may not be successful and our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.Our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of divestituresOn August 30, 2018, we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of businesses within two operating segments: our international biscuits and snacks operating segment, which includes Arnott’s, Kelsen and our operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan; and the Campbell Fresh operating segment, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business. We expect to use the proceeds from these divestitures to reduce debt. Our ability to successfully divest these businesses and any other businesses we decide to divest may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. Potential risks of divestitures may also include diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees, suppliers and/or customers of divested businesses, the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and the inability to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. If we are unable to complete or realize the projected benefits of planned and/or future divestitures, we may not be able to reduce our debt as planned and our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.We incurred substantial indebtedness to finance the acquisition of Snyder's-LanceIn connection with the closing of the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance and the payoff of Snyder's-Lance indebtedness, we incurred approximately $6.2 billion of indebtedness through a combination of senior notes and a senior unsecured term loan facility. This substantial level of indebtedness increased our debt service obligations. It may also have other important consequences to our business, including but not limited to:•increasing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates;•subjecting us to financial and other covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default;•increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including undertaking significant capital projects;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and•restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities, including other acquisitions.In addition, we regularly access the commercial paper markets for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. If our credit ratings are further downgraded, we may have difficulty selling additional debt securities or borrowing money in the amounts and on the terms that might be available if our credit ratings were maintained. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources"" for information regarding our credit ratings.Disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets may also reduce the amount of commercial paper that we can issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms we find acceptable. Limitations on our ability to access the capital markets, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs may adversely affect our business and financial results.6 We may not realize the anticipated benefits from our cost reduction initiativesWe are pursuing multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $945 million by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. These initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of these initiatives and, in some respects, our plans to achieve these cost savings continue to be in development. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives"" for additional information on these initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often complex initiatives. Any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our business or financial results.The anticipated benefits of acquiring Snyder's-Lance may not be fully realized or realized within the time frame that we expectWe expect that the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance will result in various benefits including, among other things, cost savings, cost synergies, a strengthened market position and revenue opportunities. Achieving these anticipated benefits is subject to uncertainties, including whether we integrate in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Integrating Snyder's-Lance will be a complex and time-consuming process that requires investment. We may experience unanticipated difficulties, delays or expenses related to the integration, including but not limited to:•diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns;•managing a larger combined business;•finalizing the integration of Snyder's-Lance's past acquisitions to the extent not yet completed;•perceived adverse changes in product offerings to consumers, whether or not these changes actually occur;•assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;•the retention of key suppliers and customers of Snyder's-Lance;•attracting new business and operational relationships; and•retaining and integrating key employees and maintaining employee morale.We plan to combine certain operations, functions, systems and processes, which we may be unsuccessful or delayed in implementing. In addition, costs for synergies and integration may be more than anticipated, and there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. The failure to effectively address any of these risks, or any other risks related to the integration of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition, may adversely affect our business and financial results.We may not be able to increase prices to fully offset increases in the cost of transportation and logistics and prices of raw and packaging materials The cost of distribution has increased due to a significant rise in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess demand, reduced availability and higher fuel costs. In addition, certain of the materials required for the manufacture of our products, including steel, have been or may be impacted by new or recently proposed tariffs.As a manufacturer of food and beverage products, the raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, dairy, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease, crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements (including tariffs), drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control. We may not be able to offset any price increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity. We try to pass along to customers some or all cost increases through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.7 We operate in a highly competitive industryWe operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry and experience competition in all of our categories. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. A number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. In addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a continued shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customersOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and e-commerce retailers. This trend away from traditional retail grocery is expected to continue in the future. If we are not successful in expanding sales in growing retail channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers. In 2018, U.S. soup sales declined primarily due to a key customer's different promotional approach for soup. These customers may also use more of their shelf space for their private label products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. In 2018, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. There can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results. Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brandsWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is primarily based on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our businessOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors. This damage or disruption could result from execution issues, as well as factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as product or raw material scarcity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputationWe have in the past and we may, in the future, need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in that category.8 Our non-U.S. operations pose additional risks to our businessIn 2018, approximately 19% of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the U.S. Our business or financial condition may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in these markets, including but not limited to the following:•unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions;•the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies;•the difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; •the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;•political or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, public corruption, armed hostilities or terrorist acts; •the possible nationalization of operations; •the difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and •restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the U.S., including potential adverse tax consequences.In addition, we hold assets and incur liabilities, generate revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and adversely affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. On August 30, 2018, we announced plans to pursue the divestiture of our international biscuits and snacks operating segment, which includes Arnott’s, Kelsen and our operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan. If and until this operating segment is divested, we expect to continue to conduct business as usual in markets outside of the U.S. An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth As of July 29, 2018, we had goodwill of $4.580 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $3.123 billion. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. We have, in the most recently completed and prior years, experienced impairment charges. See ""Significant Accounting Estimates"" and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on past impairments. We may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brandsWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. Competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results. 9 We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plansWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the U.S. and various non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.We may be adversely impacted by a failure or security breach of our information technology systemsOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage our data, communications and business processes, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, procurement, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attack or other security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential information), service disruptions or other system failures. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches, disruptions or failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations. To address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and security policies, cyber insurance, employee training, and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems. Although we have not experienced a material incident to date, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident.We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business We depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.On May 18, 2018, we announced the appointment of an Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.  The search for and transition to a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer may result in disruptions to our business and uncertainty among investors, employees and others concerning our future direction and performance. Any such disruptions and uncertainty, as well as the failure to successfully identify, attract or retain a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactionsWe may undertake additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms, obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions. Potential risks also include:•the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner;•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•potential loss of key employees, suppliers and/or customers of acquired businesses;•assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;•the inability to achieve anticipated benefits, including revenues or other operating results; •operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected; •the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment; and•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present added unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes.10 Market Conditions and Other General Risk Factors
Actions of activist shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business We have become the target of activist shareholder activities. If these activities continue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist shareholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, suppliers and other strategic partners, and cause our share price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.We face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, may adversely impact us.Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operationsOur business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could:•unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have an adverse impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;•disrupt our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products;•disrupt the retail operations of our customers; or•unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, our products.In addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. This growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results. Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors
We may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claimsWe are party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. The marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. In addition, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used by Pepperidge Farm and Snyder’s-Lance, has come under increased regulatory scrutiny. Our independent contractor distribution model has also been the subject of various lawsuits in recent years. In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue).Increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial resultsThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. Various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including but not limited to the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Governmental and administrative bodies within the U.S. are considering a variety of tax, trade and other regulatory reforms. Trade reforms include tariffs on certain materials used in the manufacture of our products and tariffs on certain finished products. 11 Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised regulatory requirements for the labeling of nutrition facts, serving sizes and genetically modified ingredients), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial results"
7,CPB,CAMPBELL SOUP CO,2017-09-27,"Risk Factors
In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. Operational Risk Factors
We operate in a highly competitive industryWe operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry and experience competition in all of our categories. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, nutritional value, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. In addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding are creating new competition. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a continued shift towards store brand offerings, could result in us reducing prices, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.Our results are dependent on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying into faster-growing spacesOur strategy is focused on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying our portfolio into faster-growing spaces. Our core businesses are concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional retail grocery channels. Factors that may impact our success include our ability to: •identify and capture market share in faster-growing spaces;•identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends, including those related to fresh or organic products;•design and implement effective retail execution plans;•design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs, including digital programs; and•secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers. 5 If we are not successful in addressing these factors, or if there are changes in the underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete, our strategy may not be successful and/or our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customersOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade, which has experienced slower growth than alternative retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores, Internet-based retailers and meal-delivery services. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. If we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, retailers with increased buying power and negotiating strength are seeking more favorable terms, including increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers. These customers may use more of their shelf space for their store brand products.  If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. In 2017, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales. There can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results. We may not realize the anticipated benefits from our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives We are pursuing a multi-year cost savings initiative with targeted annualized cost savings of $450 million by the end of 2020. In addition, we are making other organizational changes, including changes to our sales and supply chain functions. These initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale. From time-to-time, we may also implement other information technology or related initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often complex initiatives. Any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our business or financial results.Our results may be adversely affected by our inability to complete or realize the projected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactionsWe expect to continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to acquisitions and other strategic transactions may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable counterparties, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms, obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected and complete those transactions. Potential risks also include:•the inability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner;•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•potential loss of key employees, suppliers and/or customers of acquired businesses;•assumption of unknown risks and liabilities;•the inability to achieve anticipated benefits, including revenues or other operating results; •operating costs of acquired businesses may be greater than expected; •the inability to promptly implement an effective control environment; and•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present added unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, our ability to meet our objectives may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers, negotiate favorable financial and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals on the terms expected. Potential risks of divestitures may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units effectively and efficiently from our existing business operations and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our businessOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as product or raw material scarcity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected 6 by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease and/or crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.Our non-U.S. operations pose additional risks to our businessIn 2017, approximately 19% of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales. Our business or financial condition may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the U.S., including but not limited to the following:•unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions;•the difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; •the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;•the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies;•political or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, public corruption, armed hostilities or terrorist acts; •the possible nationalization of operations; •the difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and •restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the U.S., including potential adverse tax consequences.In addition, we hold assets and incur liabilities, generate revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and adversely affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.Our results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materialsThe raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, dairy, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease and/or crop pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements, drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control. To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, we may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity.Price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplaceWe expect to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputationWe have in the past and we may, in the future, need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category.7 Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brandsWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.We may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systemsOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of our functions, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. We periodically test our systems to attempt to detect vulnerabilities.  If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these events, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations. Although unauthorized users have attempted and continue to attempt to infiltrate our information technology systems, we are not aware of a material security breach and all immaterial security breaches we have detected have been successfully remediated.An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth As of July 30, 2017, we had goodwill of $2.115 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $912 million. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. See ""Significant Accounting Estimates"" for additional information on past impairments. We may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brandsWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. Competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results. We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plansWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in the U.S. and various non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.8 We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business We depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Market Conditions and Other General Risk Factors
We face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, may adversely impact us.Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operationsOur business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could:•unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have an adverse impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;•disrupt our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products;•disrupt the retail operations of our customers; or•unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, our products.In addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. This growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors
We may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claimsWe are party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. The marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. In addition, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used by Pepperidge Farm, has come under increased legal and regulatory scrutiny in recent years. We are a defendant in state law class action litigation challenging the independent contractor classification of a small percentage of the total Pepperidge Farm distribution network. We are contesting class certification and the merits as appropriate and plan to defend against these claims vigorously. In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue).Increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial resultsThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. Various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Governmental and administrative bodies within the U.S. are considering a variety of tax, trade and other regulatory reforms. Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving 9 size regulations), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results"

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. Operational Risk Factors
We operate in a highly competitive industryWe operate in the highly competitive food and beverage industry and experience global competition in all of our principal products. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of our primary competitors are larger than us and have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. In addition, reduced barriers to entry and easier access to funding may create new competition. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.5 Our results are dependent on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying into faster-growing spaces Our strategy is focused on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying our portfolio into faster-growing spaces. Our core businesses are concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional retail grocery channels. Factors that may impact our success include: •our ability to identify and capture market share in faster-growing spaces;•our ability to identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends, including those related to fresh or organic products;•our ability to design and implement effective retail execution plans;•our ability to design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs, including digital programs;•our ability to secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers; and•changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete. If we are not successful in addressing these factors, our strategy may not be successful and/or our business or financial results may be adversely impacted.We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customersOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. Alternative retail channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and Internet-based retailers, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. If we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices, increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers or more favorable terms. These customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. In 2016, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 40% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales. There can be no assurance that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results. We may not realize the anticipated benefits from our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives In the beginning of 2016, we implemented a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. We are also pursuing related initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as adopting zero-based budgeting over time. These initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale. From time-to-time, we may also implement other supply chain, information technology or related initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these initiatives, which are often complex. Any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our business or financial results.Our results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfullyWe expect to seek acquisitions and investment opportunities. Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include:•the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations;•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses;•potential assumption of unknown liabilities;•the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment; and •the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, potential risks may also 6 include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from us effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our businessOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as product or raw material scarcity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease and/or crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.Our non-U.S. operations pose additional risks to our businessIn 2016, approximately 19% of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the U.S. Our strategy depends in part on expanding our operations in developing markets. Sales outside the U.S. are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales. Our business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the U.S., including but not limited to the following:•unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions;•the difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; •the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;•the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies;•political or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, public corruption, armed hostilities or terrorist acts; •the possible nationalization of operations; •the difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and •restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the U.S., including potentially adverse tax consequences.In addition, we hold assets and incur liabilities, generate revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and adversely affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.Our results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materialsThe raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including crop size, cattle cycles, disease and/or pests, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements, drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients and other factors that may be beyond our control (including natural disasters). To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, we may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity.Price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplaceWe intend to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.7 If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims and damage to our reputationWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category.Our results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brandsWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be adversely impacted.We may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systemsOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of our functions, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these events, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations. Although unauthorized users have attempted and continue to attempt to infiltrate our information technology systems, we have not detected a material security breach and all immaterial security breaches we have detected have been successfully remediated.An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our financial results and net worth As of July 31, 2016, we had goodwill of $2.263 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $927 million. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates.In the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of our annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $141 million ($127 million after tax or $.41 per share) on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit, which is part of the Campbell Fresh segment. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.We may be required in the future to record additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial results and net worth. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brandsWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect 8 our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. Competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results. We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plansWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the U.S. and various non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business We depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Market Conditions and Other General Risk Factors
We face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact us.Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operationsOur business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could:•unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have an adverse impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;•disrupt our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products;•disrupt the retail operations of our customers; or•unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, our products.In addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. This growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors
We may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings or claimsWe are party to a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Since these actions are inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. The marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. In addition, the independent contractor distribution model, which is used by Pepperidge Farm, has come under increased legal and regulatory scrutiny in recent years. We have a few putative state law class action lawsuits challenging the independent 9 contractor classification of a small percentage of the total Pepperidge Farm distribution network. We are contesting class certification and the merits in each lawsuit and plan to defend against these claims vigorously. In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in proceedings or claims (even if untrue).Increased regulation or changes in law could adversely affect our business or financial resultsThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. Various laws and regulations govern the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results"

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive industryWe operate in the highly competitive food industry and experience international competition in all of our principal products. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of our primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.Our results are dependent on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying into faster-growing spaces Our strategy is focused on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying our portfolio into faster-growing spaces. Our core businesses are concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional mass and grocery channels. Factors that may impact our success include:  •our ability to identify and capitalize on faster-growing spaces;•our ability to identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends, including those related to new or improved products or packaging or to our existing products;•our ability to design and implement effective retail execution plans;•our ability to design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs, including digital programs;•our ability to secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers; and•changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete. If we are not successful in addressing theses factors, our strategy may not be successful and/or our business or financial results may be negatively impacted.  We may not realize anticipated benefits from our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives We recently implemented a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. We are also pursuing related initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as streamlining our organization and adopting zero-based budgeting over time. The success of these initiatives presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require extensive negotiations with third parties, such as suppliers and other business partners. As a result, we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from the initiatives. Other events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits, or cause us not to realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. In addition, the initiatives may not advance our strategy as expected. Finally, the complexity of the initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. From time-to-time, we may also implement other supply chain, information technology or related initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these additional initiatives, which are often complex. Any failure to implement our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial results.Our results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfullyOur ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include:•the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations;•diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses;6 •potential assumption of unknown liabilities;•the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment; •potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and •the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience.  Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from us effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. Our business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed.  Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our businessOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, crop disease and/or crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.Our non-U.S. operations pose additional risks to our businessIn 2015, approximately 21% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales. Our business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the U.S., including but not limited to the following:•unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions;•the difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; •the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;•the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies;•political or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, armed hostilities or terrorist acts; •the possible nationalization of operations; •the difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and •restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the U.S., including potentially negative tax consequences.In addition, we hold assets and incur liabilities, generate revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.We face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact us.Increased regulation or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business or financial resultsThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as 7 the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Changes in regulatory requirements (such as proposed labeling requirements), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results.  In addition, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or could adversely affect our business or financial results.  Our results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materialsThe raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including crop size, cattle cycles, disease, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements, drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change). To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, we may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity.Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operationsOur business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could:•unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;•disrupt our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products;•disrupt the retail operations of our customers; or•unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, our products.In addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. This growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. Price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplaceWe intend to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customersOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. In recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and Internet-based retailers, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. If we are not successful in pursuing our strategy to expand sales in alternative retail grocery channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices, increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers or more favorable terms. These customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. In 2015, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results. 8 If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims if consumers are injuredWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. Such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim.  We may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systemsOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on  our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of our functions, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. If we are unable to prevent material failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations.   Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brandsWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted.An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial results and net worth As of August 2, 2015, we had goodwill of $2.3 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $960 million. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value.

The company's business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the U.S., including but not limited to the following:•unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions;•the difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; •the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;•the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies;•political or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, armed hostilities or terrorist acts; •the possible nationalization of operations; •the difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and •restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the U.S., including potentially negative tax consequences.In addition, the company holds assets and incurs liabilities, generates revenue, and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The company's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and the company must translate its assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the company's consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.The company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for the company's products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact the company's ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact the company.Increased regulation or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect the company's business or financial resultsThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of the company's food products, as well as the health and safety of the company's employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. The company is also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Changes in regulatory requirements (such as proposed labeling requirements), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.  In addition, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Legal proceedings or claims related to the company's marketing could damage the company's reputation and/or could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.  The company's results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materialsThe raw and packaging materials used in the company's business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, weather conditions, import and export requirements and changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs.  To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through its commodity hedging activity.7 Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect the company's business or operationsThe company's business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could:•unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;•disrupt the company's ability, or the ability of its suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute the company's products;•disrupt the retail operations of the company's customers; or•unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, the company's products.In addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. This growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the company's business or financial results. Price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplaceThe company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of its products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, the company's business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.The company may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of its customersThe company's businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. In recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and Internet-based retailers, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. If the company is not successful in pursuing its strategy to expand sales in alternative retail grocery channels, its business or financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers. These customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products. If the company is unable to use its scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted. In 2014, the company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 35% of the company's consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 19% of the company's consolidated net sales. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of the company's other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect the company's business or financial results. If the company's food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items, and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injuredThe company may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to the company's reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of its products, ingredients or packaging. Such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim.  8 The company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, its information technology systemsThe company's information technology systems are critically important to the company's operations. The company relies on  its information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of its functions, including its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. If the company is unable to prevent material failures, the company's operations may be impacted, and the company may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations.   The company's results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of its brandsThe company has a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of the company's business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on the company's ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that the company has acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about the company's products, packaging and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), the company's failure to maintain the quality of its products, the failure of the company's products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about the company, its brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage the company's brands and reputation.  If the company does not maintain the favorable perception of its brands, the company's results could be negatively impacted.The company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology or other initiativesThe company's success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient, which is necessary in the company's highly competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an interruption to the company's sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service or accounting functions.The company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to its defined benefit pension plansThe company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the U.S. and various non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of the company's defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in the company's obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company"

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial also may impair the company’s business operations and financial condition. The company operates in a highly competitive industryThe company operates in the highly competitive food industry and experiences international competition in all of its principal products. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of the company's primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to the company's marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.The company's results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company's products, including new or improved product and packaging introductionsThe company's results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company's products. The company's new or improved product and packaging introductions, along with its other marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on customer or consumer trends. In order to remain successful, the company must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new or improved products or packaging to address them. While the company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal, the company may not be successful in developing new or improved products or packaging, or its new or improved products or packaging may not be accepted by customers or consumers.The company's results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfullyThe company's ability to meet its objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on its ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into the company's existing operations, diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses, potential assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with the sellers, potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, and the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which the company has limited or no prior experience.  Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase the company's exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from the company effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. The company's business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed.  Disruption to the company's supply chain could adversely affect its businessThe company's ability to manufacture and/or sell its products may be impaired by damage or disruption to its manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of its suppliers or contract manufacturers, as a result of adverse weather conditions (such as drought, temperature extremes or floods), natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of carrots by the company's Bolthouse Farms business may be also be adversely affected by water scarcity, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect the company's business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location.

In addition, as part of the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, the company acquired a significant U.S. producer of fresh carrots. The production of carrots may be adversely impacted by the events listed above, as well as by water scarcity, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.The company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditionsCustomer and consumer demand for the company's products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity  market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations.

The success of any such acquisition or divestiture depends, in part, upon the company's ability to identify suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual terms and, in many cases, obtain governmental approval. For acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into the company's existing operations, successfully managing new risks associated with the acquired business and achieving expected returns and other benefits.

These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an interruption to the company's sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service or accounting functions.The company's results may be impacted negatively by political conditions in the countries where the company does businessThe company has operations or does business in multiple countries. Because of its international reach, the company's performance may be impacted negatively by politically motivated factors, such as unfavorable changes in tariffs or export and import restrictions, in these countries. The company may also be impacted by political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities and terrorist acts in these countries.If the company's food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items, and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injuredThe company may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. The company may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against it. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to the company's reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the company's products. In addition, the company's results could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the company's products, ingredients or packaging, even in the absence of a recall or a product liability case.  The company's results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of its brandsThe company has a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of the company's business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on the company's ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that the company has acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about the company's products (whether or not valid), the company's failure to maintain the quality of its products, the failure of the company's products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about the company, its brands or products on social or digital media could seriously damage the company's brands and reputation.  If the company does not maintain the favorable perception of its brands, the company's results could be negatively impacted"
13,CPB,CAMPBELL SOUP CO,2011-09-28,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report,    the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely    affect the companys business, financial condition and    results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not    presently known to the company or that the company currently    deems immaterial also may impair the companys business    operations and financial condition. The    company operates in a highly competitive industry     The company operates in the highly competitive food industry and    experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal    products. The principal areas of competition are brand    recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion,    convenience and service. A number of the companys primary    competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other    resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of    these competitors to the companys marketplace efforts, or    a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result    in the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other    expenditures,    and/or    losing market share. The    company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit    market disruptions and other economic conditions     Customer and consumer demand for the companys products may    be impacted by recession or other economic downturns in the    United States or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in    financial and credit markets may impact the companys    ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its    customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in any    one of the following factors in the United States or other    nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market    disruptions or other reasons, could impact the company: tax    rates, interest rates or equity markets. Increased    regulation could adversely affect the companys business or    financial results     The manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively    regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the    processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising,    labeling, quality and safety of the companys food    products, as well as the health and safety of the companys    employees and the protection of the environment. In the United    States, the company is subject to regulation by various    government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration,    the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade    Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration    and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various    state and local agencies. The company is also regulated by    similar agencies outside the United States and by voluntary    organizations, such as the National Advertising Division and the    Childrens Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative of the    Council of    4     Better Business Bureaus. Changes in regulatory requirements    (such as proposed requirements designed to restrict food    marketing), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory    requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital    expenditures and other financial obligations that could    adversely affect the companys business or financial    results. Fluctuations    in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the    companys results     The company holds assets and incurs liabilities, generates    revenue, and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than    the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar, Canadian    dollar, and the euro. The companys consolidated financial    statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and therefore the    company must translate its assets, liabilities, sales and    expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes.    As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may    materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the    companys consolidated financial statements, even if their    value has not changed in their original currency. The    companys results may be adversely impacted by increases in    the price of raw and packaging materials     The raw and packaging materials used in the companys    business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry,    vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these    materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of    factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials,    commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency    fluctuations, weather conditions (including the potential    effects of climate change), import and export requirements and    changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs. To the    extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and    packaging material prices, the company may not be able to offset    such increases through productivity or price increases or    through its commodity hedging activity. Price    increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may    result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in    the marketplace     The company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost    increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs    through increases in the selling prices of some of its products.    Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume.    To the extent the price increases are not sufficient to offset    increased raw and packaging materials and other inputs costs,    and/or if    they result in significant decreases in sales volume, the    companys business results and financial condition may be    adversely affected. The    companys results are dependent on successful marketplace    initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the companys    products, including new products or packaging    introductions     The companys results are dependent on successful    marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the    companys products. The companys product    introductions and product improvements, along with its other    marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on customer    or consumer trends. In order to remain successful, the company    must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new    products or processes to address them. While the company devotes    significant resources to meeting this goal, the company may not    be successful in developing new products or processes, or its    new products or processes may not be accepted by customers or    consumers. The    company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and    costs related to its defined benefit pension plans     The company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans    for employees in the United States and various    non-U.S. locations.    The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust    assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of    securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory    requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment    returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the    funded status of the companys defined benefit pension    plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost,    future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status    as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in the    companys obligations or future funding requirements could    have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the    company.    5 The    company may be adversely impacted by the increased significance    of some of its customers     The retail grocery trade continues to consolidate. These    consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with    increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek    lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their    suppliers. These customers may also in the future use more of    their shelf space, currently used for the companys    products, for their private label products. If the company is    unable to use its scale, marketing expertise, product innovation    and category leadership positions to respond to these customer    initiatives, the companys business or financial results    could be negatively impacted. In addition, the disruption of    sales to any of the companys large customers for an    extended period of time could adversely affect the    companys business or financial results. The    company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or failure    of, its information technology systems     Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of    transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount    of dollars involved is so significant, the companys    information technology resources must provide connections among    its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer    service, and accounting functions. If the company does not    allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build    and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to    maintain the related computerized and manual control processes,    the companys business or financial results could be    negatively impacted. Furthermore, the companys information    technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches or    other system failures. If the company is unable to prevent such    security breaches or system failures, the companys    business or financial results could be negatively impacted. The    company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost    savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information    technology or other initiatives     The companys success is partly dependent upon properly    executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from,    its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other    initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make    the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution    of its products, which is necessary in the companys highly    competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a    failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not    meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an    interruption to the companys sales, manufacturing,    logistics, customer service or accounting functions. Disruption    to the companys supply chain could adversely affect its    business     Damage or disruption to the companys suppliers or to the    companys manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to    weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes,    or other reasons could impair the companys ability to    manufacture    and/or sell    its products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the    likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively    manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is    sourced from a single location, could adversely affect the    companys business or financial results. The    company may be adversely impacted by the failure to execute    acquisitions and divestitures successfully     From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or    divestitures. The success of any such acquisition or divestiture    depends, in part, upon the companys ability to identify    suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual    terms and, in many cases, obtain governmental approval. For    acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently    integrating the acquired business into the companys    existing operations, successfully managing new risks associated    with the acquired business and achieving expected returns and    other benefits. Acquisitions outside the United States may    present unique challenges or increase the companys    exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including    foreign currency risks and the risks of complying with foreign    regulations. Finally, for acquisitions, the company may incur    substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely    impact its credit rating. In cases where acquisitions or    divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the    companys business or financial results could be negatively    impacted.    6 The    companys results may be impacted negatively by political    conditions in the nations where the company does    business     The company is a global manufacturer and marketer of    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Because of its    global reach, the companys performance may be impacted    negatively by politically motivated factors, such as unfavorable    changes in tariffs or export and import restrictions, in the    nations where it does business. The company may also be impacted    by political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities    and terrorist acts in the nations where it does business. If the    companys food products become adulterated or are    mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items and may    experience product liability claims if consumers are    injured     The company may need to recall some of its products if they    become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. The company may    also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes    injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant    losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product    inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product    for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from    a significant product liability judgment against it. A    significant product recall or product liability case could also    result in adverse publicity, damage to the companys    reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the    companys products. In addition, the companys results    could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the    safety and quality of the companys products, ingredients    or packaging, even in the absence of a recall or a product    liability case. Adverse publicity about the companys    products, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from    buying the companys products. "

Changes in regulatory    requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment    returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the    funded status of the companys defined benefit pension    plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost,    future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status    as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in the    companys obligations or future funding requirements could    have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the    company. The    company may be adversely impacted by the increased significance    of some of its customers     The retail grocery trade continues to consolidate. These    consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with    increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek    lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their    suppliers. These customers may also in the future use more of    their shelf space, currently used for our products, for their    private label products. If the company is unable to use its    scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category    leadership positions to respond to these customer initiatives,    the companys business or financial results could be    negatively impacted. In addition, the disruption of sales to any    of the companys large customers for an extended period of    time could adversely affect the companys business or    financial results. The    company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or failure    of, its information technology systems     Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of    transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount    of dollars involved is so significant, the companys    information technology resources must provide connections among    its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer    service, and accounting functions. If the company does not    allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build    and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to    maintain the related computerized and manual control processes,    the companys business or financial results could be    negatively impacted.    5Table of ContentsThe    company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost    savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information    technology or other initiatives     The companys success is partly dependent upon properly    executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from,    its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other    initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make    the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution    of its products, which is necessary in the companys highly    competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a    failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not    meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an    interruption to the companys sales, manufacturing,    logistics, customer service or accounting functions. Disruption    to the companys supply chain could adversely affect its    business     Damage or disruption to the companys suppliers or to the    companys manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to    weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes,    or other reasons could impair the companys ability to    manufacture    and/or sell    its products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the    likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively    manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is    sourced from a single location, could adversely affect the    companys business or financial results. The    company may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully    execute acquisitions and divestitures     From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or    divestitures. The success of any such acquisition or divestiture    depends, in part, upon the companys ability to identify    suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual    terms and, in many cases, obtain governmental approval. For    acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently    integrating the acquired business into the companys    existing operations. In cases where acquisitions or divestitures    are not successfully implemented or completed, the    companys business or financial results could be negatively    impacted. The    companys results may be impacted negatively by political    conditions in the nations where the company does    business     The company is a global manufacturer and marketer of    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Because of its    global reach, the companys performance may be impacted    negatively by politically motivated factors, such as unfavorable    changes in legal or regulatory requirements, tariffs, or export    and import restrictions, in the nations where it does business.    The company may also be impacted by political instability, civil    disobedience, armed hostilities, natural disasters and terrorist    acts in the nations where it does business. If the    companys food products become adulterated or are    mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items and may    experience product liability claims if consumers are    injured     The company may need to recall some of its products if they    become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. The company may    also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes    injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant    losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product    inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product    for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from    a significant product liability judgment against it. A    significant product recall or product liability case could also    result in adverse publicity, damage to the companys    reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the    companys food products. "
