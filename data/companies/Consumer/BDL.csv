7,BDL,FLANIGANS ENTERPRISES INC,2023-12-29,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stockinvolves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and all other informationincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additional risks and uncertaintiesnot currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referenced herein, may also become materialand may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business,financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertaintiesand you may lose part or all of your investment. Certain statements in this reportcontain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow, capital expenditures,or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s currentexpectations regarding future events and use words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “may”,“will” and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of the date they were made and involve a number of risksand uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Severalfactors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations. New risks anduncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they may arise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation toupdate any forward-looking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information, future events or other developments,except as required by applicable laws and regulations. Risks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 Pandemic Has Had A SignificantImpact On Our Operations Since March 2020 And Could Materially And Adversely Affect Our Future Business And Financial Results.  In March 2020, a novel strainof coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic and related suggestedand mandated social distancing and “shelter-in-place” orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively,“COVID-19”) caused significant disruptions to our business, adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adverselyaffect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future, particularly if further government directives areput in place for a significant amount of time. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permitted the federal Public Health Emergencyfor COVID-19 (PHE) declared by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) under Section 319 of the PublicHealth Service (PHS) Act to expire at the end of the day on May 11, 2023. We have experienced significant issues relating to suppliers and laborimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers’ employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitationson travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, or if the supply chain is disrupted for any other reason suchas travel limitations and other restrictions on commerce, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants andour operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions. The impact of COVID-19, and the volatile regionaland global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A -Risk Factors
 and elsewhere in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. If we are not able to respond to and managethe impact of such events effectively, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted.Risks Related to Our Business  If we are unable tostaff and retain qualified restaurant and package liquor store management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market,we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 12  Similarto the broader economy, we are experiencing labor shortfalls relative to our sales levels in certain parts of our workforce. If we areunable to attract and retain qualified people, our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses, andour ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively and to meet our customers’ demand could be limited, any of which couldmaterially adversely affect our financial performance. We have experiencedand continue to experience significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing businesswill significantly increase, which could materially adversely impact our financial performance.Increasesin minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages, extensions of personal and other leave policies, other governmental regulations affectinglabor costs and a diminishing pool of potential staff members when the unemployment rate falls and legal immigration is restricted, especiallyin certain localities, could significantly increase our labor costs and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, any ofwhich could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Webelieve the United States federal government may significantly increase the federal minimum wage and tip credit wage (or eliminate thetip credit wage) and require significantly more mandated benefits than what is currently required under federal law. The State of Floridahas already enacted a minimum wage and tip credit, with the minimum wage currently at $12.00 per hour and a tip credit of $3.02 per hour.The minimum wage increases $1.00 per hour annually until it reaches $15.00 per hour in 2027. The tip credit does not increase. In additionto increasing the overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wagesand other benefits paid to other staff members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similarconsiderations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employa large workforce, any wage increase and/or expansion of benefits mandates will have a particularly significant impact on our labor costs.Our vendors, contractors and business partners are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increasetheir price for goods, construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs. Additionally, while our employees arenot currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements, union organizers may engage in efforts to organize our employees and thoseof other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to unionize, our labor costs could increase and it couldnegatively impact our culture, reduce our flexibility and disrupt our business. In addition, our responses to any union organizing effortscould negatively impact our reputation and dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants.Ourlabor expenses include significant costs related to our health benefit plans. Health care costs continue to rise and are especially difficultto project. Material increases in costs associated with medical claims, or an increase in the severity or frequency of such claims, maycause health care costs to vary substantially from year-over-year. Given the unpredictable nature of actual health care claims trends,including the severity or frequency of claims, in any given year our health care costs could significantly exceed our estimates,which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Anysignificant changes to the healthcare insurance system could impact our healthcare costs. Material increases in healthcare costs couldmaterially adversely affect our financial performance.Whilewe try to offset labor cost increases through price increases, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greatereconomies of scale, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and respondto increased labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.Our Sales and Profit Growth Could BeAdversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase Comparable RestaurantSales or They May Decrease.  While future sales growthwill depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-periodsales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is becausethe profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to bespread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitabilitydue to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. There is no assurancethat comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2024 due to, among other things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. 13  Our ability to increase comparablerestaurant sales depends on many factors, including:  ●perceptions of the Flanigan’s brand;  ●competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services and other dining options;  ●executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies;  ●changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;  ●our ability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business;  ●weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and  ●changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food. As a result, it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparablerestaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our controland therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases. High Unemployment, Instability in the HousingMarket, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer Discretionary Spending ThatWould Materially Affect our Financial Performance. COVID-19 has had a significantimpact on domestic economies and will likely continue to negatively impact these economies for some time. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. In addition to COVID-19, factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in generaleconomic conditions (including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels,instability in the housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen,our financial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor Store IndustryCould Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. The restaurant and package liquorstore industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location and manyrestaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors withsubstantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well establishedin the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may developrestaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to compete successfullywith the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability andwill result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need tomodify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or store conceptsthat may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that thesemodifications will not reduce our profitability. New Information Or Attitudes Regarding DietAnd Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues. Regulations and consumereating habits may change because of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may include regulations thatimpact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number of states, counties and citiesare enacting menu-labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guestsor restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part,upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to trendsin eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or deletecertain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affectcustomer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.14  Adverse Public Or Medical Opinions About HealthEffects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/Or Package Liquor Stores And About OthersAcross The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us.  Restaurant operators have received more scrutiny fromregulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certain products. An unfavorable reporton the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those items could influence the demand for our offerings.In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of food quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, oroperating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in thefood supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest trafficbecause of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our results of operations. Our Inability To Successfully And SufficientlyRaise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction,utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduceguest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected. However, we have notexperienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases. Increases in Food Costs, Raw Materials and OtherSupplies and Services Due to Inflation May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins depend on,among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beveragecosts, utilities and other supplies and services due to inflation. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for ourprincipal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we are currentlyunable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can be subject to unforeseensupply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost of key inputs, fuel costs, weatherand other market conditions outside of our control caused by inflation. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Oursuppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefitcosts, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services suppliedto us. Shortages or Interruptions in the Supplyof Food Offering Ingredients and/or Liquor Inventory Could Adversely Affect our Operating Results.  Ourbusiness is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory. We may experience shortages,delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants due to inclement weather, natural disasters,labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers, distributors or transportation providers or other conditions beyond ourcontrol. In addition, we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients, including baby back ribs. Althoughwe believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory, shortagesor interruptions in our supply of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory could adversely affect our financial results. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely AffectedIf We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner. To grow successfully, we must open new restaurantsand/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant and/or package liquor store openingsfrom time to time and may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2023, we opened our new limited partnership owned restaurantin Miramar, Florida (Store #25) for business, as well as our company owned package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and ournewly built stand-alone package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for business, replacing our package liquor store destroyedby fire which previously operated at that site. During our fiscal year 2023, we also continued constructing a stand-alone building onthe same site in Hollywood, Florida adjacent to Store #19P, replacing our restaurant destroyed by fire which previously operated at thatsite (Store #19R). We anticipate that the restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) will open for business in March 2024. Our ability to open and profitablyoperate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and economicallyviable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of limited partnerinvestors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timelybasis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the availabilityof construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and building materialcosts, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or morerestaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time. If we are unable to manage these risks successfully, wewill face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,operating results and cash flow. 15  Changes In Customer Preferences For Casual DiningStyles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance. Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, side dishesand desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. A change from thisdining style may have an adverse effect on our business. Our Success Depends Substantially on the Valueof our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have built a reasonablystrong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants. We believewe must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer trust inor affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance,or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. Our Marketing And Advertising Strategies MayNot Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business. From time to time, we introducenew advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customers inthe manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to invest in marketingand advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. If these marketing andadvertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associated with these programs willadversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect. Labor Shortages, An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To AttractEmployees Could Harm Our Business. Our employees are essential toour operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retain enoughqualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience,our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, whichcould result in higher labor costs. Due To Our Geographic Locations, RestaurantsAre Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations. All but one (1) of our restaurantsand package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. During hurricane season,(June 1 through November 30 each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanesand tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurants and package liquorstores or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurantsand/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected. If We Were to Experience Widespread DifficultyRenewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be Adversely Affected.  Mostof the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extensionoptions in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal ofsubstantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increasein rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewingleases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants. Substantialincreases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins. Due To Our Geographic Locations, We May NotBe Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate. Due to the anticipated activehurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurant and packageliquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates. Ifwe are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then we will be self-insuredfor all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effectupon our financial condition and/or results of operations. We secured windstorm insurance coverage for the period commencing December30, 2023 at a higher premium. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of windstorm insurance for the period commencing December30, 2023 on page 31. 16  Our Inability or Failure to Execute a Comprehensive Business ContinuityPlan at our Restaurant Support Centers Following a Disaster or Force Majeure Event could have a Material Adverse Impact on our Business. Manyof our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant and package liquor store operations are centralized atone location.  We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address crisis-level events, includinghurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and informationand the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a limited test of our ability to manage our business remotely. However, if we are unable to fullyimplement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardinessin required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication andoperating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrativeand other legal claims. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of accurately and timely predicting,planning for and protecting against the threat. As a result, our disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans security maynot adequately address all threats we face or protect us from loss. Inability To Attract And Retain Customers CouldAffect Results Of Operations. We take pride in our ability toattract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not return andresults may be negatively affected. A Failure To Comply With Governmental RegulationsCould Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulation byfederal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departments relating tothe development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to the following:  ●the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages;  ●employment;  ●building construction and access;  ●zoning requirements; and  ●the environment. Our facilities are licensed andsubject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants will be subjectto compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary licenses or otherapprovals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. Various federal and state laborlaws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefit and workauthorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of many of our restaurants,even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employees may not all meet federalwork authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. Our business can be adversely affected by negativepublicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illness or other healthconcerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicity could negatively impact publicperception of our brands. We are required to complywith the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholicbeverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities fora license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for causeat any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimumage of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensingof alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and we may be forcedto terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants.17  The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection with theconstruction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities.Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,results of operations or cash flows.We May Face Liability Under Dram ShopStatutes.Our sale of alcoholic beveragessubjects us to “dram shop” statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholicbeverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintainour insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.There are currently no “dram shop” claims pending against us. See “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation”for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply.Concerns relatingto pandemics and other diseases, food safety and food-borne illness could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our foodsupply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.TheCOVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on our customer traffic and ability to operate our restaurants and may do so againin the foreseeable future. Future pandemics and other diseases may have a similar or more severe impact.In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach, whichis not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “madcow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as, hepatitis A,trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect the priceand availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales could decline.Instances of food-borneillnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity about usor the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspectsof the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customersto produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forcedto temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity, or as a resultof a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business.If We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers’Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed.  In connection with credit cardsales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use private networks, thirdparties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit cardsales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper accessto this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable informationor disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, and liability, and could seriously disruptour operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. We have not experienced any security breachesto date. If We Experience a Significant Failure in orInterruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Business Could Be Adversely Impacted. We use a variety of applicationsand systems to manage the flow of information securely within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure.The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling,training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarilyon a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records sales transactions,receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allows employees to entertime clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system at each restaurantor store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. Ourability to manage efficiently and effectively our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systemsand our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale system and related networks and applications. These systemsmay be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft,fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whetherfrom security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitions to new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptionsto or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adversely impacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negativelyimpacting our ability to manage our business. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recoveryplans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for anylosses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materiallyadversely affected. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. 18  The Effect of Recent Changes to U.S. Healthcare Laws May IncreaseOur Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results.  We offer eligible full-timeemployees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons, many of our eligible employeescurrently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010,the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase our labor costs significantly. In general,implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likely to impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and othereffects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financialand operating results.Governmental Regulation in One or Moreof the Following Areas May Adversely Affect Our Existing and Future Operations and Results, Including by Harming Our Ability to Open NewRestaurants or Increasing Our Operating Costs. Employmentand Immigration RegulationsWeare subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, includingwage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirements regardingworking conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance andworkers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and canbe cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuits have been filedagainst us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We could suffer losses fromand we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition,several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, paidsick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S.healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses.Wealso are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From time to time,the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from timeto time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigrationor work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and makeour hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us withgovernment-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorizedworkers. We currently participate in the “E-Verify” program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government toverify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properlyidentify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experienceadverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination ofa significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adversepublicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penaltiesand other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliancelaws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.On the other hand, in the event we wrongfully rejectwork authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racialminority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We couldexperience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance,or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our businesscould be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.19  Additionally,while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurantcompanies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts tomaintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws, including the possiblepassage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employeesbeing subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposingrequirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture.Americanswith Disabilities Act and Similar State LawsWeare subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individualswith disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connection withADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigningcertain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expensesassociated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADAor similar state laws, could be material.Nutritionand Food RegulationInrecent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on thefood industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments havebeen a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. haveadopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or make other nutritional informationavailable and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reform law went into effect as of December 1,2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they select their food and beverage choicesdecreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customers’ buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.Privacy/CybersecurityWeare required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of someof our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatoryenvironment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and information systems are compromisedor if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that couldadversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these typesof security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.Local Licensure, Zoning and Other RegulationEachof our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplacesafety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for newrestaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respectto zoning, use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.EnvironmentalLawsWeare subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposalof hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmentalreview of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or futureenvironmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with orto satisfy claims relating to environmental laws.We Could BeParty To Litigation That Could Adversely Affect Us By Distracting Management, Increasing Our Expenses or Subjecting Us to Material MoneyDamages and Other Remedies.Wecould be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to materialmoney damages and other remedies. We could become subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplaceand employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similarmatters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could filecomplaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to ourrestaurants or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurantindustry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertisingpractices.20  Regardless of whetherany claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may diverttime and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materially andadversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, whether directedat us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects,which in turn could adversely affect our results.Our SuccessMay Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel.OurChairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002.August Bucci, Jeffrey Kastner and Christopher O’Neil, our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President ofPackage Operations, respectively, have also served with us since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci, since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastnerand 2016 in the case of Mr. O’Neil, and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executiveofficers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success andthat may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executiveofficers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a changein leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of ourcurrent strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.We Are Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity. Althoughwe maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology,there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Any material incidents could cause us to experiencefinancial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expensesrelated to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.  Cyber threats are rapidly evolving andare becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and becomemore difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors taketo anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software,disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipatethese techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched,and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. If our information securitysystems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial lossesand we may incur costs to remediate possible harm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impacton our business.If There isa Material Failure in our Information Technology Systems, Our Business Operations and Profits Could Be Negatively Affected and our Systemsmay be Inadequate to Support our Future Growth Strategies.Werely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financialsystems, marketing programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions.Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems,including technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient toeffectively manage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrading and maintenanceover time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital.Moreover,these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruptionfrom hurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches,or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacementsystems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network for any of the above reasons could resultin interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negatively impact our results of operations.21  Acts of Violenceat or Threatened Against our Restaurants or the Centers in which they are Located, including Active Shooter Situations and Terrorism,Could Unfavorably Impact our Restaurant Sales, Which Could Materially Adversely Affect our Financial Performance.Anyact of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situationsand terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in thelong-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic andmake it more difficult to staff our restaurants fully, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, suchas active shooter or future terrorist attacks military and governmental responses, and the protest of future wars, may result in negativechanges to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending. Additionally, decreases in consumer discretionary spendingmay impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out at restaurants or the amount they spend on meals while dining outat restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may alsoadversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of planned menu price increases to help preserve our operating margins.Social MediaImpact on Customer Perceptions of our Brand.Theconsiderable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated.The adverse impact of publicity on customers’ perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If the impactof any such publicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished.Our DigitalBusiness, Which Has Become an Increasingly Significant Part of Our Business, is Subject to Risks. Primarilydue to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue derived from digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup has increased substantially.While we are uncertain as to whether this business will continue to increase and/or be significant, we have implemented technology, targetedadvertising and promotions and to some extent remodeled our restaurants, to accommodate the growth of our digital business. If we do notcontinue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to recoup these costs or achieve our sales growth potential. We relyon third-party delivery services to fulfill package store delivery orders, and the ordering and payment platforms used by these third-parties,or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adverselyimpact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, our delivery partners are responsible for orderfulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries could cause guests to stop ordering from us. The third-party delivery businessis competitive, with a number of players competing for market share and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services thatwe utilize cease or curtail operations, increase their fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors,our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted.Our InstitutionalLender No Longer Originates, Renews or Modifies loans at LIBOR Effective January 1, 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, ourinstitutional lender no longer originates, renews or modifies loans at LIBOR, except in limited situations. As of September 30, 2023,we had one variable rate instrument outstanding that is impacted by changes in interest rates. The variable rate debt instrument is equalto the lender’s BSBY Screen Rate plus one and one-half percent (1.50%) per annum. As a means of managing our interest rate riskon the debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third party lender to convert this variablerate debt obligation to fixed rate. "

The novel coronavirus pandemic and related suggestedand mandated social distancing and “shelter-in-place” orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively,“COVID-19”) caused significant disruptions to our business, adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adverselyaffect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future, particularly if further government directives areput in place for a significant amount of time. Throughout our fiscal year 2022, in accordance with guidance from health officials, weoffered both indoor and outdoor food and bar options at all of our restaurants. The COVID-19pandemic’s impact on the economy in general, globally, nationally and locally, could also adversely affect our guests’ financialcondition, resulting in reduced spending at our restaurants and package liquor stores. The COVID-19 pandemic and these responses haveaffected and will continue to adversely affect our guest traffic, sales and operating costs and we cannot predict how long the pandemicwill last or what other government responses may occur.During ourfiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.00 per share to shareholders of record on March 31, 2022, payableon April 19, 2022. During our fiscal year 2021, our Board of Directors did not declare a cash dividend due to uncertainty surroundingthe duration of restrictions mandated by state and local governments in response to COVID-19.15 Table of Contents We haveexperienced significant issues relating to suppliers and labor impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers’ employees areunable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19,or if the supply chain is disrupted for any other reason such as travel limitations and other restrictions on commerce, we could faceshortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.The impactof COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, may also precipitate or exacerbate otherrisks discussed in this Item 1A - Risk Factors
 and elsewhere in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situationis changing rapidly and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider to presentsignificant risks to our operations. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business andfinancial condition will be negatively impacted.RisksRelated to Our Business  If we are unable tostaff and retain qualified restaurant and package liquor store management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market,we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Similarto the broader economy, we are experiencing labor shortfalls relative to our sales levels in certain parts of our workforce. If we areunable to attract and retain qualified people, our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses, andour ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively and to meet our customers’ demand could be limited, any of which couldmaterially adversely affect our financial performance. We have experiencedand continue to experience significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing businesswill significantly increase, which could materially adversely impact our financial performance.Increasesin minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages, extensions of personal and other leave policies, other governmental regulations affectinglabor costs and a diminishing pool of potential staff members when the unemployment rate falls and legal immigration is restricted, especiallyin certain localities, could significantly increase our labor costs and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, any ofwhich could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Webelieve the United States federal government may significantly increase the federal minimum wage and tip credit wage (or eliminate thetip credit wage) and require significantly more mandated benefits than what is currently required under federal law. The State of Floridahas already enacted a minimum wage and tip credit, with the minimum wage currently at $11.00 per hour and a tip credit of $3.02 per hour.The minimum wage increases $1.00 per hour annually until it reaches $15.00 per hour in 2027. The tip credit does not increase. In additionto increasing the overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wagesand other benefits paid to other staff members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similarconsiderations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employa large workforce, any wage increase and/or expansion of benefits mandates will have a particularly significant impact on our labor costs.Our vendors, contractors and business partners are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increasetheir price for goods, construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs. Additionally, while our employees arenot currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements, union organizers may engage in efforts to organize our employees and thoseof other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to unionize, our labor costs could increase and it couldnegatively impact our culture, reduce our flexibility and disrupt our business. In addition, our responses to any union organizing effortscould negatively impact our reputation and dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants.16 Table of Contents Ourlabor expenses include significant costs related to our health benefit plans. Health care costs continue to rise and are especially difficultto project. Material increases in costs associated with medical claims, or an increase in the severity or frequency of such claims, maycause health care costs to vary substantially from year-over-year. Given the unpredictable nature of actual health care claims trends,including the severity or frequency of claims, in any given year our health care costs could significantly exceed our estimates,which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Anysignificant changes to the healthcare insurance system could impact our healthcare costs. Material increases in healthcare costs couldmaterially adversely affect our financial performance.Whilewe try to offset labor cost increases through price increases, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greatereconomies of scale, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and respondto increased labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.Our Sales and Profit Growth Could BeAdversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase Comparable RestaurantSales or They May Decrease.  While future sales growthwill depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-periodsales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is becausethe profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to bespread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitabilitydue to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. There is no assurancethat comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2023 due to, among other things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. Our ability to increase comparablerestaurant sales depends on many factors, including: ·perceptions of the Flanigan’s brand;·competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant        industry and from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services and other        dining options;·executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies;·changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;·our ability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business;·weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and·changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food.17 Table of Contents As a result it is possiblethat we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative.A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurantsales increases. High Unemployment, Instability in the HousingMarket, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer Discretionary Spending ThatWould Materially Affect our Financial Performance. COVID-19 has had a significantimpact on domestic economies and will likely continue to negatively impact these economies for some time. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. In addition to COVID-19, factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in generaleconomic conditions (including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels,instability in the housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen,our financial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor Store IndustryCould Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. The restaurant and package liquorstore industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location and manyrestaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors withsubstantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well establishedin the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may developrestaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to compete successfullywith the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability andwill result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need tomodify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or store conceptsthat may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that thesemodifications will not reduce our profitability. New Information Or Attitudes Regarding DietAnd Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues. Regulations and consumereating habits may change because of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may include regulations thatimpact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number of states, counties and citiesare enacting menu-labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guestsor restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part,upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to trendsin eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or deletecertain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affectcustomer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.Adverse Public Or Medical Opinions About HealthEffects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/or Package Liquor Stores And About OthersAcross The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us.  18 Table of Contents Restaurant operators have receivedmore scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certain products. Anunfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those items could influence thedemand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of food quality issues, illness, injury,health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants, restaurants operated by othersor generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our reputation. A decreasein guest traffic because of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our results of operations. Our Inability To Successfully And SufficientlyRaise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction,utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduceguest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected. However, we have notexperienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases. Increases in Food Costs, Raw Materials and OtherSupplies and Services Due to Inflation May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins depend on,among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beveragecosts, utilities and other supplies and services due to inflation. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for ourprincipal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we are currentlyunable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can be subject to unforeseensupply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost of key inputs, fuel costs, weatherand other market conditions outside of our control caused by inflation. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Oursuppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefitcosts, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services suppliedto us. Shortages or Interruptions in the Supplyof Food Offering Ingredients and/or Liquor Inventory Could Adversely Affect our Operating Results.  Ourbusiness is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory. We may experience shortages,delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants due to inclement weather, natural disasters,labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers, distributors or transportation providers or other conditions beyond ourcontrol. In addition, we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients, including baby back ribs. Althoughwe believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory, shortagesor interruptions in our supply of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory could adversely affect our financial results. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely AffectedIf We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner. 19 Table of Contents To grow successfully, we mustopen new restaurants and/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant and/or packageliquor store openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2022, we opened our new limitedpartnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) for business and continued developing our new limited partnership owned restaurantin Miramar, Florida (Store #25), which we anticipate opening for business in February 2023. During our fiscal year 2022, we also continueddeveloping our new package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24). Our ability to open and profitablyoperate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and economicallyviable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of limited partnerinvestors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timelybasis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the availabilityof construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and building materialcosts, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or morerestaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time. If we are unable to manage these risks successfully, wewill face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,operating results and cash flow. Changes In Customer Preferences For Casual DiningStyles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance. Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, side dishesand desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. A change from thisdining style may have an adverse effect on our business. Our Success Depends Substantially on the Valueof our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have built a reasonablystrong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants. We believewe must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer trust inor affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance,or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. Our Marketing And Advertising Strategies MayNot Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business. From time to time, we introducenew advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customers inthe manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to invest in marketingand advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. If these marketing andadvertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associated with these programs willadversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect. 20 Table of Contents Labor Shortages, An Increase In Labor Costs,Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business. Our employees are essential toour operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retain enoughqualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience,our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, whichcould result in higher labor costs. Due To Our Geographic Locations, RestaurantsAre Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations. All but one (1) of our restaurantsand package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. During hurricane season,(June 1 through November 30 each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanesand tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurants and package liquorstores or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurantsand/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected. Hurricane Ian, which struck the Southwest Coastof Florida on September 28, 2022 did not impact any of the Company’s locations. If We Were to Experience Widespread DifficultyRenewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be Adversely Affected.  Mostof the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extensionoptions in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal ofsubstantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increasein rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewingleases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants. Substantialincreases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins. Due To Our Geographic Locations, We May NotBe Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate. Due to the anticipated activehurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurant and packageliquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates. Ifwe are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then we will be self-insuredfor all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effectupon our financial condition and/or results of operations. We secured windstorm insurance coverage for the period commencing December30, 2022 at a higher premium. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of windstorm insurance for the period commencing December30, 2022 on page 38.) 21 Table of Contents Our Inability or Failureto Execute a Comprehensive Business Continuity Plan at our Restaurant Support Centers Following a Disaster or Force Majeure Event couldhave a Material Adverse Impact on our Business.  Manyof our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant and package liquor store operations are centralized atone location.  We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address crisis-level events, includinghurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and informationand the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a limited test of our ability to manage our business remotely. However, if we are unable to fullyimplement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardinessin required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication andoperating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrativeand other legal claims. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of accurately and timely predicting,planning for and protecting against the threat. As a result, our disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans security maynot adequately address all threats we face or protect us from loss. Inability To Attract And Retain Customers CouldAffect Results Of Operations. We take pride in our ability toattract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not return andresults may be negatively affected. A Failure To Comply With Governmental RegulationsCould Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulation byfederal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departments relating tothe development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to the following: ·the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages;·employment;·building construction and access;·zoning requirements; and·the environment.Our facilities are licensed andsubject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants will be subjectto compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary licenses or otherapprovals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. Various federal and state laborlaws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefit and workauthorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of many of our restaurants,even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employees may not all meet federalwork authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. 22 Table of Contents Our business can be adverselyaffected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illnessor other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicity could negativelyimpact public perception of our brands. We are required to complywith the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholicbeverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities fora license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for causeat any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimumage of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensingof alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and we may be forcedto terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants.The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection with theconstruction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities.Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,results of operations or cash flows.We May Face Liability Under Dram ShopStatutes.Our sale of alcoholic beveragessubjects us to “dram shop” statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholicbeverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintainour insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.There are currently no “dram shop” claims pending against us. See “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation”for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply.Concerns relatingto pandemics and other diseases, food safety and food-borne illness could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our foodsupply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.TheCOVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on our customer traffic and ability to operate our restaurants and may do so againin the foreseeable future. Future pandemics and other diseases may have a similar or more severe impact.In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach, whichis not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “madcow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as, hepatitis A,trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect the priceand availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales could decline.23 Table of Contents Instances of food-borne illnesses,real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurantindustry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the diningexperience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to producethe revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarilyclose some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change inour menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business. If We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers’Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed.  In connection with credit cardsales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use private networks, thirdparties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit cardsales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper accessto this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable informationor disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, and liability, and could seriously disruptour operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. We have not experienced any security breachesto date. If We Experience a Significant Failure in orInterruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Business could be Adversely Impacted. We use a variety of applicationsand systems to manage the flow of information securely within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure.The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling,training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarilyon a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records sales transactions,receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allows employees to entertime clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system at each restaurantor store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. Ourability to manage efficiently and effectively our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systemsand our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale system and related networks and applications. These systemsmay be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft,fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whetherfrom security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitions to new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptionsto or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adversely impacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negativelyimpacting our ability to manage our business. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recoveryplans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for anylosses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materiallyadversely affected. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. 24 Table of Contents The Effect of Recent Changes to U.S. HealthcareLaws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results.  We offer eligible full-timeemployees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons, many of our eligible employeescurrently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010,the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase our labor costs significantly. In general,implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likely to impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and othereffects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financialand operating results.Governmental Regulation in One or Moreof the Following Areas May Adversely Affect Our Existing and Future Operations and Results, Including by Harming Our Ability to Open NewRestaurants or Increasing Our Operating Costs. Employmentand Immigration RegulationsWeare subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, includingwage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirements regardingworking conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance andworkers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and canbe cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuits have been filedagainst us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We could suffer losses fromand we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition,several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, paidsick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S.healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses.Wealso are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From time to time,the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from timeto time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigrationor work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and makeour hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us withgovernment-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorizedworkers. We currently participate in the “E-Verify” program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government toverify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properlyidentify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experienceadverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination ofa significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adversepublicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penaltiesand other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliancelaws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.25 Table of Contents Onthe other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparateimpact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violationof anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance,anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees.Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.Additionally,while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurantcompanies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts tomaintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws, including the possiblepassage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employeesbeing subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposingrequirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture.Americanswith Disabilities Act and Similar State LawsWeare subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individualswith disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connection withADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigningcertain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expensesassociated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADAor similar state laws, could be material.Nutritionand Food RegulationInrecent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on thefood industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments havebeen a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. haveadopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or make other nutritional informationavailable and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reform law went into effect as of December 1,2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they select their food and beverage choicesdecreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customers’ buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.Privacy/CybersecurityWeare required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of someof our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatoryenvironment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and information systems are compromisedor if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that couldadversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these typesof security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.26 Table of Contents LocalLicensure, Zoning and Other RegulationEachof our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplacesafety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for newrestaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respectto zoning, use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.EnvironmentalLawsWeare subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposalof hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmentalreview of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or futureenvironmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with orto satisfy claims relating to environmental laws.We Could BeParty To Litigation That Could Adversely Affect Us By Distracting Management, Increasing Our Expenses or Subjecting Us to Material MoneyDamages and Other Remedies.Wecould be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to materialmoney damages and other remedies. We could become subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplaceand employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similarmatters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could filecomplaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to ourrestaurants or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurantindustry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertisingpractices.Regardlessof whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend andmay divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materiallyand adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, whetherdirected at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects,which in turn could adversely affect our results.Our SuccessMay Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel.OurChairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002.August Bucci, Jeffrey Kastner and Christopher O’Neil, our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President ofPackage Operations, respectively, have also served with us since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci, since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastnerand 2016 in the case of Mr. O’Neil, and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executiveofficers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success andthat may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executiveofficers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a changein leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of ourcurrent strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.27 Table of Contents We are Exposedto Risks Related to Cybersecurity.Althoughwe maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology,there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Any material incidents could cause us to experiencefinancial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expensesrelated to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.  Cyber threats are rapidly evolving andare becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and becomemore difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors taketo anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software,disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipatethese techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched,and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. If our information securitysystems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial lossesand we may incur costs to remediate possible harm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impacton our business.If There isa Material Failure in our Information Technology Systems, Our Business Operations and Profits could be Negatively Affected and our Systemsmay be Inadequate to Support our Future Growth Strategies.Werely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financialsystems, marketing programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions.Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems,including technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient toeffectively manage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrading and maintenanceover time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital.Moreover,these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruptionfrom hurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches,or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacementsystems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network for any of the above reasons could resultin interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negatively impact our results of operations.Acts of Violenceat or Threatened Against our Restaurants or the Centers in which they are Located, including Active Shooter Situations and Terrorism,Could Unfavorably Impact our Restaurant Sales, which could Materially Adversely Affect our Financial Performance.Anyact of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situationsand terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in thelong-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic andmake it more difficult to staff our restaurants fully, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.28 Table of Contents Theoccurrence or threat of extraordinary events, such as active shooter or future terrorist attacks military and governmental responses,and the protest of future wars, may result in negative changes to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending.Additionally, decreases in consumer discretionary spending may impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out at restaurantsor the amount they spend on meals while dining out at restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Adecrease in consumer discretionary spending may also adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of planned menu price increasesto help preserve our operating margins.Social MediaImpact on Customer Perceptions of our Brand.Theconsiderable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated.The adverse impact of publicity on customers’ perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If the impactof any such publicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished.Our digitalbusiness, which has become an increasing significant part of our business, is subject to risks. Primarilydue to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue derived from digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup has increased substantially.While we are uncertain as to whether this business will continue to increase and/or be significant, we have implemented technology, targetedadvertising and promotions and to some extent remodeled our restaurants, to accommodate the growth of our digital business. If we do notcontinue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to recoup these costs or achieve our sales growth potential. We relyon third-party delivery services to fulfill package store delivery orders, and the ordering and payment platforms used by these third-parties,or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adverselyimpact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, our delivery partners are responsible for orderfulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries could cause guests to stop ordering from us. The third-party delivery businessis competitive, with a number of players competing for market share and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services thatwe utilize cease or curtail operations, increase their fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors,our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impactedOur institutionallender no longer originates, renews or modifies loans at LIBOR effective January 1, 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, ourinstitutional lender no longer originates, renews or modifies loans at LIBOR, except in limited situations. The limited exceptions includeour LIBOR transactions which reduce or hedge our LIBOR exposure on contracts entered into before January 1, 2022. As of October 1, 2022,we had two variable rate instruments outstanding that are impacted by changes in interest rates. The interest rate of the first variablerate debt instrument is equal to the lender’s LIBOR Rate plus two and one-quarter percent (2.25%) per annum and was paid in fullsubsequent to October 1, 2022. The second variable rate debt instrument is equal to the lender’s BSBY Screen Rate plus one and one-halfpercent (1.50%) per annum. As a means of managing our interest rate risk on the second debt instrument, we entered into an interest rateswap agreement with our unrelated third party lender to convert this variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate. "

The novel coronavirus pandemic and related suggestedand mandated social distancing and “shelter-in-place” orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively,“COVID-19”) caused significant disruptions to our business, adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adverselyaffect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future, particularly if further government directives areput in place for a significant amount of time. Throughout our fiscal year 2021, in accordance with guidance from health officials, weoffered both indoor and outdoor food and bar options at all of our restaurants, with, among other precautions, appropriate social distancingand mask requirements for all customers and employees. The COVID-19pandemic’s impact on the economy in general, globally, nationally and locally, could also adversely affect our guests’ financialcondition, resulting in reduced spending at our restaurants and package liquor stores. The COVID-19 pandemic and these responses haveaffected and will continue to adversely affect our guest traffic, sales and operating costs and we cannot predict how long the pandemicwill last or what other government responses may occur.In the secondquarter of fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors voted to cancel a previously declared cash dividend due to uncertainty surrounding theduration of closures of our dining rooms and other restrictions mandated by state and local governments in response to COVID-19. Duringour fiscal year 2021, our Board of Directors did not declare a cash dividend due to uncertainty surrounding the duration of restrictionsmandated by state and local governments in response to COVID-19.We havenot experienced any significant issues related to suppliers; however, our suppliers could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.If our suppliers’ employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other governmentrestrictions in connection with COVID-19, or if the supply chain is disrupted for any other reason such as travel limitations and otherrestrictions on commerce, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales couldbe adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.The impactof COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, may also precipitate or exacerbate otherrisks discussed in this Item 1A - Risk Factors
 and elsewhere in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situationis changing rapidly and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider to presentsignificant risks to our operations. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business andfinancial condition will be negatively impacted.Risks Relatedto Our Business  If we are unable tostaff and retain qualified restaurant and package liquor store management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market,we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.16 Table of Contents Similarto the broader economy, we are experiencing labor shortfalls relative to our sales levels in certain parts of our workforce. If we areunable to attract and retain qualified people, our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses, andour ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively and to meet our customers’ demand could be limited, any of which couldmaterially adversely affect our financial performance. We have experiencedand continue to experience significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing businesswill significantly increase, which could materially adversely impact our financial performance.Increasesin minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages, extensions of personal and other leave policies, other governmental regulations affectinglabor costs and a diminishing pool of potential staff members when the unemployment rate falls and legal immigration is restricted, especiallyin certain localities, could significantly increase our labor costs and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, any ofwhich could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Webelieve the United States federal government may significantly increase the federal minimum wage and tip credit wage (or eliminate thetip credit wage) and require significantly more mandated benefits than what is currently required under federal law. In addition to increasingthe overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wages and other benefitspaid to other staff members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similar considerations, historicallyreceived a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employ a large workforce, any wageincrease and/or expansion of benefits mandates will have a particularly significant impact on our labor costs. Our vendors, contractorsand business partners are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increase their price for goods,construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs.Ourlabor expenses include significant costs related to our health benefit plans. Health care costs continue to rise and are especially difficultto project. Material increases in costs associated with medical claims, or an increase in the severity or frequency of such claims, maycause health care costs to vary substantially from year-over-year. Given the unpredictable nature of actual health care claims trends,including the severity or frequency of claims, in any given year our health care costs could significantly exceed our estimates,which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Anysignificant changes to the healthcare insurance system could impact our healthcare costs. Material increases in healthcare costs couldmaterially adversely affect our financial performance.Whilewe try to offset labor cost increases through price increases, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greatereconomies of scale, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and respondto increased labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.Our Sales and Profit Growth Could BeAdversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase Comparable RestaurantSales or They May Decrease.  While future sales growthwill depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-periodsales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is becausethe profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to bespread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitabilitydue to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. There is no assurancethat comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2022 due to, among other things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. 17 Table of Contents Our ability to increase comparablerestaurant sales depends on many factors, including: ·perceptions of the Flanigan’s brand;·competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant        industry and from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services and other        dining options;·executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies;·changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;·our ability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business;·weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and·changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food. As a result it is possiblethat we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative.A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurantsales increases. High Unemployment, Instability in the HousingMarket, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer Discretionary Spending ThatWould Materially Affect our Financial Performance. COVID-19 has had a significantimpact on domestic economies and will likely continue to negatively impact these economies for some time. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. In addition to COVID-19, factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in generaleconomic conditions (including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels,instability in the housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen,our financial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor Store IndustryCould Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. The restaurant and package liquorstore industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location and manyrestaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors withsubstantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well establishedin the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may developrestaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to compete successfullywith the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability andwill result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need tomodify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or store conceptsthat may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that thesemodifications will not reduce our profitability. 18 Table of Contents New Information Or Attitudes Regarding DietAnd Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues. Regulations and consumereating habits may change because of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may include regulations thatimpact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number of states, counties and citiesare enacting menu-labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guestsor restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part,upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to trendsin eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or deletecertain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affectcustomer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.Adverse Public Or Medical Opinions About HealthEffects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/or Package Liquor Stores And About OthersAcross The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us.  Restaurant operators have receivedmore scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certain products. Anunfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those items could influence thedemand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of food quality issues, illness, injury,health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants, restaurants operated by othersor generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our reputation. A decreasein guest traffic because of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our results of operations. Our Inability To Successfully And SufficientlyRaise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction,utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduceguest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected. However, we have notexperienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases. Increases in Food Costs, Raw Materials and OtherSupplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins depend on,among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beveragecosts, utilities and other supplies and services. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for our principal commodity,supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we are currently unable to contract forextended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and costfluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost of key inputs, fuel costs, weather and other marketconditions outside of our control. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Our suppliers also may be affected byhigher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses thatthey pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. 19 Table of Contents Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely AffectedIf We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner. To grow successfully, we mustopen new restaurants and/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant and/or packageliquor store openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2021, we continued developingour new restaurants in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) and Miramar, Florida (Store #25). During our fiscal year 2021, we also continued developingour new package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24). Our ability to open and profitablyoperate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and economicallyviable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of limited partnerinvestors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timelybasis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the availabilityof construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and building materialcosts, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or morerestaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time. If we are unable to manage these risks successfully, wewill face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,operating results and cash flow. Changes In Customer Preferences For Casual DiningStyles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance. Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, side dishesand desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. A change from thisdining style may have an adverse effect on our business. Our Success Depends Substantially on the Valueof our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have built a reasonablystrong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants. We believewe must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer trust inor affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance,or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. Our Marketing And Advertising Strategies MayNot Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business. From time to time, we introducenew advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customers inthe manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to invest in marketingand advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. If these marketing andadvertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associated with these programs willadversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect.20 Table of Contents Labor Shortages, An Increase In Labor Costs,Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business. Our employees are essential toour operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retain enoughqualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience,our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, whichcould result in higher labor costs. Increases In Employee Minimum Wages By The FederalOr State Government Could Adversely Affect Business. Certain of our Company employeesare paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as fixed annual increasesin the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since our business is labor-intensive,shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which could harm our financial performance. Due To Our Geographic Locations, RestaurantsAre Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations. All but one (1) of our restaurantsand package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. During hurricane season,(June 1 through November 30 each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanesand tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurants and package liquorstores or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurantsand/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected. If We Were to Experience Widespread DifficultyRenewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be Adversely Affected.  Mostof the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extensionoptions in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal ofsubstantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increasein rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewingleases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants. Substantialincreases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins. 21 Table of Contents Due To Our Geographic Locations, We May NotBe Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate. Due to the anticipated activehurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurant and packageliquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates. Ifwe are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then we will be self-insuredfor all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effectupon our financial condition and/or results of operations. Inability To Attract And Retain Customers CouldAffect Results Of Operations. We take pride in our ability toattract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not return andresults may be negatively affected. A Failure To Comply With Governmental RegulationsCould Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulation byfederal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departments relating tothe development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to the following: ·the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages;·employment;·building construction and access;·zoning requirements; and·the environment.        Ourfacilities are licensed and subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodelingof restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtainnecessary licenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. Various federal and state laborlaws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefit and workauthorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of many of our restaurants,even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employees may not all meet federalwork authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. Our business can be adverselyaffected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illnessor other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicity could negativelyimpact public perception of our brands. We are required to complywith the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholicbeverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities fora license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for causeat any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimumage of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensingof alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and we may be forcedto terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants.22 Table of Contents The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection with theconstruction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities.Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,results of operations or cash flows.We May Face Liability Under Dram ShopStatutes.Our sale of alcoholic beveragessubjects us to “dram shop” statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholicbeverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintainour insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.There are currently no “dram shop” claims pending against us. See “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation”for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply.Concerns relatingto pandemics and other diseases, food safety and food-borne illness could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our foodsupply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.TheCOVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on our customer traffic and ability to operate our restaurants and may continueto do so for the foreseeable future. Future pandemics and other diseases may have a similar or more severe impact.In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach, whichis not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “madcow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as, hepatitis A,trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect the priceand availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales could decline.Instances of food-borne illnesses,real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurantindustry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the diningexperience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attract enough new customers to producethe revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarilyclose some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change inour menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business. 23 Table of Contents If We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers’Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed.  In connection with credit cardsales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use private networks, thirdparties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit cardsales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper accessto this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable informationor disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, and liability, and could seriously disruptour operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. If We Experience a Significant Failure in orInterruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Business could be Adversely Impacted. We use a variety of applicationsand systems to manage the flow of information securely within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure.The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling,training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarilyon a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records sales transactions,receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allows employees to entertime clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system at each restaurantor store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. Ourability to manage efficiently and effectively our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systemsand our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale system and related networks and applications. These systemsmay be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft,fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whetherfrom security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitions to new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptionsto or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adversely impacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negativelyimpacting our ability to manage our business. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recoveryplans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for anylosses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materiallyadversely affected. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. The Effect of Recent Changes to U.S. HealthcareLaws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results.  We offer eligible full-timeemployees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons, many of our eligible employeescurrently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010,the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase our labor costs significantly. In general,implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likely to impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and othereffects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financialand operating results.24 Table of Contents Governmental Regulation in One or Moreof the Following Areas May Adversely Affect Our Existing and Future Operations and Results, Including by Harming Our Ability to Open NewRestaurants or Increasing Our Operating Costs. Employmentand Immigration RegulationsWeare subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, includingwage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirements regardingworking conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance andworkers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and canbe cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuits have been filedagainst us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We could suffer losses fromand we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition,several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, paidsick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S.healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses.Wealso are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From time to time,the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from timeto time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigrationor work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and makeour hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us withgovernment-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorizedworkers. We currently participate in the “E-Verify” program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government toverify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properlyidentify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experienceadverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination ofa significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adversepublicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penaltiesand other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliancelaws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.Onthe other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparateimpact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violationof anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance,anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees.Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.Additionally,while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurantcompanies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts tomaintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws, including the possiblepassage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employeesbeing subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposingrequirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture.25 Table of Contents Americanswith Disabilities Act and Similar State LawsWeare subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individualswith disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connection withADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigningcertain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expensesassociated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADAor similar state laws, could be material.Nutritionand Food RegulationInrecent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on thefood industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments havebeen a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. haveadopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or make other nutritional informationavailable and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reform law went into effect as of December 1,2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they select their food and beverage choicesdecreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customers’ buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.Privacy/CybersecurityWeare required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of someof our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatoryenvironment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and information systems are compromisedor if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that couldadversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these typesof security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.LocalLicensure, Zoning and Other RegulationEachof our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplacesafety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for newrestaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respectto zoning, and use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.26 Table of Contents EnvironmentalLawsWeare subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposalof hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmentalreview of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or futureenvironmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with orto satisfy claims relating to environmental laws.We Could BeParty To Litigation That Could Adversely Affect Us By Distracting Management, Increasing Our Expenses or Subjecting Us to Material MoneyDamages and Other Remedies.Wecould be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to materialmoney damages and other remedies. We could become subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplaceand employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similarmatters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could filecomplaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to ourrestaurants or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurantindustry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertisingpractices.Regardlessof whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend andmay divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materiallyand adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, whetherdirected at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects,which in turn could adversely affect our results.Our SuccessMay Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel.OurChairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002.August Bucci, Jeffrey Kastner and Christopher O’Neil, our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President ofPackage Operations, respectively, have also served with us since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci, since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastnerand 2016 in the case of Mr. O’Neil, and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executiveofficers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success andthat may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executiveofficers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a changein leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of ourcurrent strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.27 Table of Contents We are Exposedto Risks Related to Cybersecurity.Althoughwe maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology,there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Any material incidents could cause us to experiencefinancial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expensesrelated to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.  Cyber threats are rapidly evolving andare becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and becomemore difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors taketo anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software,disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipatethese techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched,and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. If our information securitysystems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial lossesand we may incur costs to remediate possible harm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impacton our business.If There isa Material Failure in our Information Technology Systems, Our Business Operations and Profits could be Negatively Affected and our Systemsmay be Inadequate to Support our Future Growth Strategies.Werely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financialsystems, marketing programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions.Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems,including technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient toeffectively manage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrading and maintenanceover time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital.Moreover,these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruptionfrom hurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches,or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacementsystems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network for any of the above reasons could resultin interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negatively impact our results of operations.Acts of Violenceat or Threatened Against our Restaurants or the Centers in which they are Located, including Active Shooter Situations and Terrorism,Could Unfavorably Impact our Restaurant Sales, which could Materially Adversely Affect our Financial Performance.Anyact of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situationsand terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in thelong-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic andmake it more difficult to staff our restaurants fully, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.28 Table of Contents Theoccurrence or threat of extraordinary events, such as active shooter or future terrorist attacks military and governmental responses,and the protest of future wars, may result in negative changes to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending.Additionally, decreases in consumer discretionary spending may impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out at restaurantsor the amount they spend on meals while dining out at restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Adecrease in consumer discretionary spending may also adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of planned menu price increasesto help preserve our operating margins.Social MediaImpact on Customer Perceptions of our Brand.Theconsiderable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated.The adverse impact of publicity on customers’ perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If the impactof any such publicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished.Our digitalbusiness, which has become an increasing significant part of our business, is subject to risks. Primarilydue to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue derived from digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup has increased substantially.While we are uncertain as to whether this business will continue to increase and/or be significant, we have implemented technology, targetedadvertising and promotions and to some extent remodeled our restaurants, to accommodate the growth of our digital business. If we do notcontinue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to recoup these costs or achieve our sales growth potential. We relyon third-party delivery services to fulfill package store delivery orders, and the ordering and payment platforms used by these third-parties,or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adverselyimpact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, our delivery partners are responsible for orderfulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries could cause guests to stop ordering from us. The third-party delivery businessis competitive, with a number of players competing for market share and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services thatwe utilize cease or curtail operations, increase their fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors,our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impactedOurinstitutional lender will no longer originate, renew or modify loans at LIBOR effective January 1, 2022.BeginningJanuary 1, 2022, our institutional lender will no longer originate, renew or modify loans at LIBOR, except in limited situations. Thelimited exceptions include our LIBOR transactions which reduce or hedge our LIBOR exposure on contracts entered into before January 1,2022. "

These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and allother information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additionalrisks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referencedherein, may also become material and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of anyof the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our commonstock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment. 14 Table of Contents Certain statements in thisreport contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow,capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflectmanagement’s current expectations regarding future events and use words such as “anticipate”, “believe”,“expect”, “may”, “will” and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of thedate they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from thoseexpressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materiallyfrom management’s expectations. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they mayarise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this reportas a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations. The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)Pandemic Has Had A Significant Impact On Our Operations Since March 2020 And Could Materially And Adversely Affect Our Future BusinessAnd Financial Results. Theglobal pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 virus) has and will continue to materially and adversely affect our restaurantbusiness for what may be a prolonged period of time. This damage and disruption has resulted from events and factors that wereimpossible for us to predict and are beyond our control. In the United States, as well as globally, individuals are being encouragedto practice social distancing, restricted from gathering in groups, and in some areas are restricted from non-essential movementsoutside of their homes. In compliance with government directives from time to time, we temporarily (i) shifted our restaurantoperations to a take-out or delivery only operating model; (ii) reduced the operating hours of our retail package stores; (iii)laid off a significant number of employees; and (iv) substantially modified our corporate operations to comply with social distancingrequirements. As a result, and despite experiencing increased sales and traffic at certain of our retail package liquor stores,these changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affected our results of operations for our fiscal year 2020and will, in all likelihood, impact our results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition for our fiscal year 2021, particularlyif further government directives are put in place for a significant amount of time.TheCOVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy in general, globally, nationally and locally, could also adversely affect our guests’financial condition, resulting in reduced spending at our restaurants and package liquor stores. The COVID-19 pandemic and theseresponses have affected and will continue to adversely affect our guest traffic, sales and operating costs and we cannot predicthow long the pandemic will last or what other government responses may occur. Moreover, once restrictions are lifted, it is unclearwhether guests will be comfortable dining out and, if so, how quickly guests will return to our restaurants, which may be a functionof continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses,and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure of consumers to return to pre-pandemic dining patterns could have along-term material adverse impact on us and our future prospects.Theequity markets in the United States have been extremely volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our stock price has fluctuatedsignificantly and may continue to do so. If the business interruptions caused by COVID-19 continue indefinitely or last longerthan we expect, we may need to seek other sources of liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruption and extremevolatility in global capital markets and is adversely affecting the availability of liquidity generally in the credit markets,and there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available on favorable terms, especially the longer theCOVID-19 pandemic lasts, or available at all. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors voted to cancel a previouslydeclared cash dividend due to uncertainty surrounding the duration of closures of our dining rooms and other restrictions mandatedby state and local governments in response to COVID-19. Additionally, certain of our restaurants have been further disrupted whenan employee has been diagnosed with COVID-19 or exposed to a person with a confirmed positive diagnosis of COVID-19. In the eventan employee has been diagnosed with COVID-19, our policy requires quarantine of some or all of a restaurant’s or store’semployees and disinfection of the restaurant or store facilities. Additionally, if an employee has direct contact with a friendor family member with a confirmed positive diagnosis of COVID-19, such employee must exclude himself or herself from work for acertain period of time. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine,limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations will be negatively impacted,potentially materially adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. If an outbreak is tracedto one or more of our locations, it could impact our reputation and subject us to legal claims.15 Table of Contents Wehave not experienced any significant issues related to suppliers; however, our suppliers could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19pandemic. If our suppliers’ employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel orother government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, or if the supply chain is disrupted for any other reason such as travellimitations and other restrictions on commerce, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants andour operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.Consideringthe significant uncertainty as to our ability to increase sales to levels we achieved before the COVID-19 pandemic based on aforementioneduncertainties and other known and unknown risks related to the pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1 – Business, Part II, Item7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discussions on Liquidity for furtherinformation. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic,may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A - Risk Factors
 and elsewhere in this report, any of whichcould have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional effects may arise that we are not presentlyaware of or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. If we are not able to respond toand manage the impact of such events effectively, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted.Our Sales and Profit Growth CouldBe Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase ComparableRestaurant Sales or They May Decrease.  While future salesgrowth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the changein period-over-period sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affectingprofit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant salesincreases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can havea significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparablerestaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2021 due to, amongother things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. Our ability to increasecomparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including: ·perceptions of the Flanigan’s brand;·competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment ofthe restaurant industry and from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit deliveryservices and other dining options;16 Table of Contents ·executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies;·changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;·our ability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business;·weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and·changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food. As a result itis possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant salescould be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustaincomparable restaurant sales increases. High Unemployment, Instability in theHousing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer DiscretionarySpending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions(including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability inthe housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen, ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor StoreIndustry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. The restaurant and packageliquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and locationand many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-establishedcompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitorsare well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally,other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to competesuccessfully with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenuesand profitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular newrestaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementingthese modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability. New Information Or Attitudes RegardingDiet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues. Regulations andconsumer eating habits may change because of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may includeregulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number ofstates, counties and cities are enacting menu-labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritionalinformation available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurantoperations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulationsand to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly,we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to ourmenu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.17 Table of Contents Adverse Public Or Medical Opinions AboutHealth Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/or Package Liquor Stores AndAbout Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us.  Restaurant operators havereceived more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certainproducts. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those itemscould influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of foodquality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants,restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specificallyharm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic because of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materiallyharm our results of operations. Our Inability To Successfully And SufficientlyRaise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements,construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted byconsumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected.However, we have not experienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases. Increases in Food Costs, Raw Materialsand Other Supplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins dependon, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including foodand beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements forour principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we arecurrently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can besubject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost ofkey inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to governmentregulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higherminimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costsfor goods and services supplied to us. Our Business Could Be Materially AdverselyAffected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner. To grow successfully, wemust open new restaurants and/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurantand/or package liquor store openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2020, wecontinued developing our new restaurant in Sunrise, Florida. During our fiscal year 2019, we developed a new package liquor storein Miami, Florida (Store #45).18 Table of Contents Our ability to open andprofitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availabilityof suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations,the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits(including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessarycontractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedulesand budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in constructiondelays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount oftime. If we are unable to manage these risks successfully, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues whichwill materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Changes In Customer Preferences For CasualDining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance. Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, sidedishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. Achange from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. Our Success Depends Substantially onthe Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have builta reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants.We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodesconsumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality,service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. Our Marketing And Advertising StrategiesMay Not Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business. From time to time, we introducenew advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customersin the manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to investin marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. Ifthese marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associatedwith these programs will adversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect. Labor Shortages, An Increase In LaborCosts, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business. Our employees are essentialto our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retainenough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyabledining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us topay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. 19 Table of Contents Increases In Employee Minimum Wages ByThe Federal Or State Government Could Adversely Affect Business. Certain of our Companyemployees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annualcost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since ourbusiness is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which couldharm our financial performance. Due To Our Geographic Locations, RestaurantsAre Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations. All but one (1) of ourrestaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. Duringhurricane season, (June 1 through November 30 each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associatedwith hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurantsand package liquor stores or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time. If customers are unableto visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected. If We Were to Experience Widespread DifficultyRenewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be Adversely Affected.  Mostof the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal orextension options in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursuethe renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases,or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurantsdue to difficulties in renewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitablereplacement restaurants. Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducingour restaurant margins. Due To Our Geographic Locations, We MayNot Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate. Due to the anticipatedactive hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurantand package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonablerates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, thenwe will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which mayhave a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. Inability To Attract And Retain CustomersCould Affect Results Of Operations. We take pride in our abilityto attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not returnand results may be negatively affected. 20 Table of Contents A Failure To Comply With GovernmentalRegulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulationby federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departmentsrelating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to the following: ·the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages;·employment;·building construction and access;·zoning requirements; and·the environment.Ourfacilities are licensed and subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodelingof restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be ableto obtain necessary licenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurantsin the future. Various federal and statelabor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefitand work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of manyof our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employeesmay not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. Our business can be adverselyaffected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borneillness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicitycould negatively impact public perception of our brands. We are requiredto comply with the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants arelocated. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county andmunicipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and maybe revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operationsof the restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventorycontrol and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations,our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants.The Federal Americanswith Disabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations andemployment. We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connectionwith the construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities.Failure to complywith these and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows.21 Table of Contents We May Face Liability Under DramShop Statutes.Our sale of alcoholicbeverages subjects us to “dram shop” statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishmentthat served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage,or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materiallyand adversely affected. There are currently no “dram shop” claims pending against us. See “Item 1. Business—GovernmentRegulation” for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply.We May Face Instances of FoodBorne Illness.In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach,which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidentsof “mad cow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (suchas, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adverselyaffect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales coulddecline.Instances of food-borneillnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity aboutus or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or otherkey aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attractenough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borneillnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concernsor negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants,could materially harm our business. If We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers’Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed. In connection with creditcard sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use privatenetworks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connectionwith credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others fromobtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroyor steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation,and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. If We Experience a Significant Failurein or Interruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Business could be Adversely Impacted. We use a variety of applicationsand systems to manage the flow of information securely within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure.The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling,training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarilyon a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records salestransactions, receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allowsemployees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured fromthis system at each restaurant or store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continuallymonitor operating results. Our ability to manage efficiently and effectively our business depends significantly on the reliabilityand capacity of these and other systems and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale systemand related networks and applications. These systems may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses andother disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events.Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whether from security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitionsto new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptions to or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adverselyimpacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negatively impacting our ability to manage our business. If ourinformation technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures,or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues andprofits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition,remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. 22 Table of Contents The Effect of Recent Changes to U.S.Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results.  We offer eligiblefull-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons, many of oureligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. health carereform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase our laborcosts significantly. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likely to impose additional administrativecosts on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they mayhave a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results.Governmental Regulation in Oneor More of the Following Areas May Adversely Affect Our Existing and Future Operations and Results, Including by Harming Our Abilityto Open New Restaurants or Increasing Our Operating Costs. Employmentand Immigration RegulationsWeare subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, includingwage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirementsregarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements,insurance and workers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantialexpense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically,lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime.We could suffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costscould be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from timeto time enacted minimum wage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changescould increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S. healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant newwelfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses.Wealso are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From timeto time, the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Securityfrom time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changesin immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us toadditional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we requireall workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employeesmay, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currently participate in the “E-Verify” program, an Internet-based,free program run by the U.S. government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, useof E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workersmay subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make itmore difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees would disrupt our operationsincluding slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs aswe train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did notfully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputation and financialperformance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.23 Table of Contents Onthe other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to havea disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could befound to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity relatedto work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it moredifficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs ordifficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.Additionally,while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of otherrestaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increaseand our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in laborlaws, including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihoodof some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our businessand financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact ouremployee culture.Americanswith Disabilities Act and Similar State LawsWeare subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individualswith disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connectionwith ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access rampsor redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons underthese laws. The expenses associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating orresolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.Nutritionand Food RegulationInrecent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levelson the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casualsegments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictionsaround the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or makeother nutritional information available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reformlaw went into effect as of December 1, 2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customersas they select their food and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customers’ buyinghabits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.24 Table of Contents Privacy/CybersecurityWeare required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as partof some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levelsand the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and informationsystems are compromised or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the impositionof penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adverselyaffected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract andkeep qualified employees.LocalLicensure, Zoning and Other RegulationEachof our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, foodand workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licensesor approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirementsof local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurantsin particular locations.EnvironmentalLawsWeare subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, releaseand disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted acomprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted inthe future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expendituresthat we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws.We CouldBe Party To Litigation That Could Adversely Affect Us By Distracting Management, Increasing Our Expenses or Subjecting Us to MaterialMoney Damages and Other Remedies.Wecould be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting usto material money damages and other remedies. We could become subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and statelaws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination,wrongful termination and similar matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or differentmatters. Our customers could file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injurythey suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food relateddisclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritionalcontent of food products sold and disclosure and advertising practices.Regardlessof whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defendand may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims againstus could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting fromthese allegations, whether directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adverselyaffect our reputation or prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.25 Table of Contents Our SuccessMay Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel.OurChairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since2002. August Bucci and Jeffrey Kastner, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, have also servedwith us since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci and since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastner, and much of our growth has occurred undertheir direction as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategyat our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We alsobelieve that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategicvision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessfulin executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy, our growth prospects or future operatingresults may be adversely impacted.We areExposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity.Althoughwe maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and othertechnology, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Any material incidents couldcause us to experience financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintainedby us and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.  Cyberthreats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems,as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeatthe measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtainunauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormantuntil a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures sincetechniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety ofsources. If our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way,our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial losses and we may incur costs to remediate possibleharm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impact on our business.IfThere is a Material Failure in our Information Technology Systems, Our Business Operations and Profits could be Negatively Affectedand our Systems may be Inadequate to Support our Future Growth Strategies.Werely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems,financial systems, marketing programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processesand transactions. Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our informationtechnology systems, including technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and servicesmay be insufficient to effectively manage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve andrequire upgrading and maintenance over time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital.26 Table of Contents Moreover,these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruptionfrom hurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, databreaches, or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioningto upgraded or replacement systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network forany of the above reasons could result in interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negativelyimpact our results of operations.Actsof Violence at or Threatened Against our Restaurants or the Centers in which they are Located, including Active Shooter Situationsand Terrorism, Could Unfavorably Impact our Restaurant Sales, which could Materially Adversely Affect our Financial Performance.Anyact of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situationsand terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and,in the long-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customertraffic and make it more difficult to staff our restaurants fully, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.Theoccurrence or threat of extraordinary events, such as active shooter or future terrorist attacks military and governmental responses,and the protest of future wars, may result in negative changes to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending.Additionally, decreases in consumer discretionary spending may impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine outat restaurants or the amount they spend on meals while dining out at restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and resultsof operations. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of plannedmenu price increases to help preserve our operating margins.SocialMedia Impact on Customer Perceptions of our Brand.Theconsiderable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated.The adverse impact of publicity on customers’ perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If theimpact of any such publicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished.Ourdigital business, which has become an increasing significant part of our business, is subject to risks. Primarilydue to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue derived from digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup has increasedsubstantially. While we are uncertain as to whether this business will continue to increase and/or be significant, we have implementedtechnology, targeted advertising and promotions and to some extent remodeled our restaurants, to accommodate the growth of ourdigital business. If we do not continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to recoup these costs or achieveour sales growth potential. We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill package store delivery orders, and the orderingand payment platforms used by these third-parties, or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, usererrors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation.Additionally, our delivery partners are responsible for order fulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries couldcause guests to stop ordering from us. The third-party delivery business is competitive, with a number of players competing formarket share and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail operations, increasetheir fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales maybe negatively impacted. 27 Table of Contents "
10,BDL,FLANIGANS ENTERPRISES INC,2019-12-20,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS An investment in our commonstock involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and allother information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additionalrisks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referencedherein, may also become material and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of anyof the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our commonstock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment. Certain statements in thisreport contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow,capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflectmanagement’s current expectations regarding future events and use words such as “anticipate”, “believe”,“expect”, “may”, “will” and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of thedate they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from thoseexpressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materiallyfrom management’s expectations. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they mayarise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this reportas a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations. 18 Table of Contents Our Sales and Profit Growth CouldBe Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase ComparableRestaurant Sales or They May Decrease.  While future salesgrowth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the changein period-over-period sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affectingprofit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant salesincreases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can havea significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparablerestaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2020 due to, amongother things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. Our ability toincrease comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including:● perceptionsof the Flanigan’s brand;● competition,especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and from other restaurantswhose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services and other dining options;● executingour strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies;● changesin consumer preferences and discretionary spending;● our abilityto increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business;● weather,natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and● changesin government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food.As a result itis possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant salescould be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustaincomparable restaurant sales increases. 19 Table of Contents High Unemployment, Instability in theHousing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer DiscretionarySpending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions(including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability inthe housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen, ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor StoreIndustry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. The restaurant and packageliquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and locationand many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-establishedcompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitorsare well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally,other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to successfullycompete with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues andprofitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular newrestaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementingthese modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability. New Information Or Attitudes RegardingDiet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues. Regulations andconsumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may includeregulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number ofstates, counties and cities are enacting menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritionalinformation available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurantoperations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulationsand to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly,we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to ourmenu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.20 Table of Contents Adverse Public Or Medical Opinions AboutHealth Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/Or Package Liquor Stores AndAbout Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us.   Restaurant operatorshave received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consumingcertain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of thoseitems could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, offood quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited numberof restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industryoverall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of these types of health concerns or negativepublicity could materially harm our results of operations.Our Inability To Successfully And SufficientlyRaise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements,construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted byconsumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected.However, we have not experienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases. Increases in Food Costs, Raw Materialsand Other Supplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins dependon, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including foodand beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements forour principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we arecurrently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can besubject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost ofkey inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to governmentregulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higherminimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costsfor goods and services supplied to us. 21 Table of Contents Our Business Could Be Materially AdverselyAffected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner To growsuccessfully, we must open new restaurants and/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienceddelays in restaurant and/or package liquor store openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future. Duringour fiscal year 2019, we developed a new package liquor store in Miami, Florida and began developing a new restaurant inSurise, Florida. During our fiscal year 2018, we had no new restaurants or package liquor stores under development. Our ability to open andprofitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availabilityof suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations,the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits(including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessarycontractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedulesand budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in constructiondelays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount oftime. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues whichwill materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Changes In Customer Preferences For CasualDining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, sidedishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. Achange from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. Our Success Depends Substantially onthe Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have builta reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants.We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodesconsumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality,service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. 22 Table of Contents  Our Marketing And Advertising StrategiesMay Not Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business From time to time, we introducenew advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customersin the manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to investin marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. Ifthese marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associatedwith these programs will adversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect. Labor Shortages, An Increase In LaborCosts, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business Our employees are essentialto our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retainenough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyabledining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us topay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. Increases In Employee Minimum Wages ByThe Federal Or State Government Could Adversely Affect Business Certain of our Companyemployees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annualcost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since ourbusiness is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which couldharm our financial performance. Due To Our Geographic Locations, RestaurantsAre Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations All but one (1) of ourrestaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. Duringhurricane season, (June 1st through November 30th each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor storesmay face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficultfor customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores, or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurantsfor a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating resultsmay be negatively affected.  23 Table of Contents If We Were to Experience Widespread DifficultyRenewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be Adversely Affected.  Mostof the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal orextension options in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursuethe renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases,or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurantsdue to difficulties in renewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitablereplacement restaurants. Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducingour restaurant margins. Due To Our Geographic Locations, We MayNot Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate Due to the anticipatedactive hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurantand package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonablerates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, thenwe will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which mayhave a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. Inability To Attract And Retain CustomersCould Affect Results Of Operations We take pride in our abilityto attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not returnand results may be negatively affected. A Failure To Comply With GovernmentalRegulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulationby federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departmentsrelating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to:    ●the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; ●employment; ●building construction and access; ●zoning requirements; and ●the environment. Our facilities are licensedand subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants willbe subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessarylicenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. 24 Table of Contents Various federal and statelabor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefitand work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of manyof our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employeesmay not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. Our business can be adverselyaffected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borneillness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicitycould negatively impact public perception of our brands. We are required to complywith the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located.Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipalauthorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revokedor suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations ofthe restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventorycontrol and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations,our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection withthe construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities. Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. We May Face Liability Under Dram ShopStatutes  Our sale of alcoholicbeverages subjects us to “dram shop” statutes. These statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishmentthat served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage,or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materiallyand adversely affected. We currently have one “dram shop” claim, which we are defending vigorously. See “Item1. Business—Government Regulation” for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply. 25 Table of Contents We May Face Instances Of Food Borne Illness In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach,which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidentsof “mad cow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (suchas, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adverselyaffect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales coulddecline. Instances of food-borneillnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity aboutus or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or otherkey aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attractenough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borneillnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concernsor negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants,could materially harm our business. If We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers’Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed. In connection with creditcard sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use privatenetworks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connectionwith credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others fromobtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroyor steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation,and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. If We Experience a Significant Failurein or Interruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Business could be Adversely Impacted. We use a variety of applicationsand systems to securely manage the flow of information within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure.The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling,training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarilyon a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records salestransactions, receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allowsemployees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured fromthis system at each restaurant or store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continuallymonitor operating results. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliabilityand capacity of these and other systems and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale systemand related networks and applications. These systems may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses andother disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events.Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whether from security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitionsto new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptions to or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adverselyimpacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negatively impacting our ability to manage our business. If ourinformation technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures,or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues andprofits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition,remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. 26 Table of Contents The Effect of Recent Changes to U.S.Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results.  Weoffer eligible full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons,many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S.health care reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increaseour labor costs significantly. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likely to impose additionaladministrative costs on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty,but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results.Governmental Regulation in One or Moreof the Following Areas May Adversely Affect Our Existing and Future Operations and Results, Including by Harming Our Ability toOpen New Restaurants or Increasing Our Operating Costs.  Employmentand Immigration RegulationsWeare subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, includingwage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirementsregarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements,insurance and workers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantialexpense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically,lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime.We could suffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costscould be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from timeto time enacted minimum wage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changescould increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S. healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant newwelfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses.27 Table of Contents Wealso are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From timeto time, the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Securityfrom time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changesin immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us toadditional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we requireall workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employeesmay, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currently participate in the “E-Verify” program, an Internet-based,free program run by the U.S. government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, useof E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workersmay subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make itmore difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees would disrupt our operationsincluding slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs aswe train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did notfully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputation and financialperformance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.Onthe other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to havea disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could befound to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity relatedto work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it moredifficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs ordifficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.Additionally,while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of otherrestaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increaseand our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in laborlaws, including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihoodof some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our businessand financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact ouremployee culture.28 Table of Contents Americans with DisabilitiesAct and Similar State LawsWeare subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individualswith disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connectionwith ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access rampsor redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons underthese laws. The expenses associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating orresolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.Nutrition and FoodRegulationInrecent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levelson the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casualsegments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictionsaround the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or makeother nutritional information available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reformlaw went into effect as of December 1, 2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customersas they select their food and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customer buying habitsin a way that adversely impacts our sales. Privacy/CybersecurityWeare required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as partof some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levelsand the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and informationsystems are compromised or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the impositionof penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adverselyaffected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract andkeep qualified employees.Local Licensure,Zoning and Other RegulationEachof our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, foodand workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licensesor approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirementsof local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurantsin particular locations.29 Table of Contents Environmental LawsWeare subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, releaseand disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted acomprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted inthe future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expendituresthat we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws. We Could Be Party To Litigation ThatCould Adversely Affect Us By Distracting Management, Increasing Our Expenses or Subjecting Us to Material Money Damages and OtherRemedies. We could be party to litigationthat could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages andother remedies. We could become subjectto numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, workhours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similar matters, and we could become subjectto class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could file complaints or lawsuits againstus alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that wehave problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant industry hasbeen subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertisingpractices. Regardless of whether anyclaims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may diverttime and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materiallyand adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations,whether directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputationor prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.OurSuccess May Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel. Our Chairmanand Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002.August Bucci and Jeffrey Kastner, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, have also served withus since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci and since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastner, and much of our growth has occurred under theirdirection as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at ourcompany that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believethat it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision.If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessfulin executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy, our growth prospects or future operatingresults may be adversely impacted.30 Table of Contents Weare Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity. Althoughwe maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and othertechnology, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.  Any material incidentscould cause us to experience financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintainedby us and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.  Cyberthreats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems,as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeatthe measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtainunauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormantuntil a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures sincetechniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety ofsources. If our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way,our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial losses and we may incur costs to remediate possibleharm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impact on our business.IfThere is a Material Failure in our Information Technology Systems, Our Business Operations and Profits could be Negatively Affectedand our Systems may be Inadequate to Support our Future Growth Strategies. We rely heavily on informationtechnology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financial systems, marketingprograms, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions. Our abilityto effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems, includingtechnology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient to effectivelymanage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrading and maintenanceover time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital. 31 Table of Contents Moreover, these technologyservices and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruption fromhurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches,or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgradedor replacement systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network for any of theabove reasons could result in interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negatively impactour results of operations.Actsof Violence at or Threatened Against our Restaurants or the Centers in which they are Located, including Active Shooter Situationsand Terrorism, Could Unfavorably Impact our Restaurant Sales, which could Materially Adversely Affect our Financial Performance. Any act of violence ator threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations and terroristactivities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in the long-term,may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic and makeit more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence or threatof extraordinary events, including active shooter or future terrorist attacks and military and governmental responses and the protestof future wars, may result in negative changes to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending. Additionally,decreases in consumer discretionary spending may impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out at restaurantsor the amount they spend on meals while dining out at restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and results of operations.A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of planned menu priceincreases to help preserve our operating margins.SocialMedia Impact on Customer Perceptions of our Brand. The considerable expansionin the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated. The adverse impactof publicity on customers’ perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If the impact of any suchpublicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished. "
12,BDL,FLANIGANS ENTERPRISES INC,2018-12-24,"     Risk Factors
 An investment in our commonstock involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and allother information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additionalrisks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referencedherein, may also become material and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of anyof the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our commonstock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment. Certain statements in thisreport contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow,capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflectmanagement’s current expectations regarding future events and use words such as “anticipate”, “believe”,“expect”, “may”, “will” and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of thedate they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from thoseexpressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materiallyfrom management’s expectations. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they mayarise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this reportas a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations. 18 Table of Contents OurSales and Profit Growth Could be Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We MayNot Successfully Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales or They May Decrease. While future salesgrowth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the changein period-over-period sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affectingprofit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant salesincreases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can havea significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparablerestaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2019 due to, amongother things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. Our ability toincrease comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including: •perceptions of the Flanigan’s brand;• competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industryand from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services andother  dining options; •executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies; •changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;  • ourability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business; •weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and •changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food;As a result itis possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant salescould be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustaincomparable restaurant sales increases. High Unemployment,Instability in the Housing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in ConsumerDiscretionary Spending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions(including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability inthe housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen, ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected. 19 Table of Contents  Intense Competition In The RestaurantAnd Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability.        The restaurant and packageliquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and locationand many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-establishedcompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitorsare well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally,other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to successfullycompete with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues andprofitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular newrestaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementingthese modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability. New InformationOr Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely AffectOur Revenues.        Regulations andconsumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may includeregulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number ofstates, counties and cities are enacting menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritionalinformation available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurantoperations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulationsand to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly,we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to ourmenu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.Adverse PublicOr Medical Opinions About Health Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/OrPackage Liquor Stores And About Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could NegativelyAffect Us.        Restaurant operatorshave received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consumingcertain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of thoseitems could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, offood quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited numberof restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industryoverall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of these types of health concerns or negativepublicity could materially harm our results of operations.20 Table of Contents Our InabilityTo Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability.        We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements,construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted byconsumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected.However, we have not experienced any adverse affects from past menu price increases. Increasesin Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other Supplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins dependon, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including foodand beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements forour principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we arecurrently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can besubject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost ofkey inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to governmentregulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higherminimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costsfor goods and services supplied to us. Our BusinessCould Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner To grow successfully, wemust open new restaurants on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to timeand may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal years 2018 and 2017 we had no new restaurants under development. Wecurrently do not have any new restaurants under development. Our ability to open andprofitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availabilityof suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations,the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits(including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessarycontractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedulesand budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in constructiondelays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount oftime. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues whichwill materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. 21 Table of Contents Changes InCustomer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, sidedishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. Achange from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. Our SuccessDepends Substantially on the Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have builta reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants.We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodesconsumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality,service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. Our Marketing AndAdvertising Strategies May Not Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business. From time to time, weintroduce new advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaigns and new media strategies donot resonate with customers in the manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase ourexpenses. We will continue to invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers orincrease their connection with our brand. If these marketing and advertising strategies do not drive increased restaurantand/or package store sales, the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial result, and we maynot generate the levels of comparable sales we expect. Labor Shortages,An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business Our employees are essentialto our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retainenough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyabledining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us topay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. IncreasesIn Employee Minimum Wages By The Federal Or State Government Could Adversely Affect Business Certain of our Companyemployees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annualcost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since ourbusiness is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which couldharm our financial performance. 22 Table of Contents Due To OurGeographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations All but one (1) of ourrestaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. Duringhurricane season, (June 1st through November 30th each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor storesmay face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficultfor customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores, or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurantsfor a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating resultsmay be negatively affected. If We Wereto Experience Widespread Difficulty Renewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be AdverselyAffected. Most of the propertieson which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension optionsin the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantiallyall of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increasein rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties inrenewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants.Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins. Due To OurGeographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At AReasonable Rate Due to the anticipatedactive hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurantand package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonablerates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, thenwe will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which mayhave a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. InabilityTo Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of Operations We take pride in our abilityto attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not returnand results may be negatively affected. 23 Table of Contents AFailure To Comply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulationby federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departmentsrelating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to:    ●the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages;  ●employment; ●building    construction and access; ●zoning    requirements; and ●the environment. Our facilities are licensedand subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants willbe subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessarylicenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. Various federal and statelabor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefitand work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of manyof our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employeesmay not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. Our business can be adverselyaffected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borneillness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicitycould negatively impact public perception of our brands. We are required to complywith the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located.Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipalauthorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revokedor suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations ofthe restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventorycontrol and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations,our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection withthe construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities. 24 Table of Contents Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. We May Face Liability Under Dram Shop StatutesOur sale of alcoholicbeverages subjects us to “dram shop” statutes. These statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishmentthat served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage,or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materiallyand adversely affected. We currently have two “dram shop” claims, which we are defending vigorously. See “Item1. Business—Government Regulation” for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply. We May Face Instances Of Food Borne Illness In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach,which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidentsof “mad cow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (suchas, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adverselyaffect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales coulddecline.Instances of food-borneillnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity aboutus or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or otherkey aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attractenough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borneillnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concernsor negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants,could materially harm our business. If We AreUnable To Protect Our Customers’ Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our ReputationCould Be Significantly Harmed. In connection with creditcard sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use privatenetworks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connectionwith credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others fromobtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroyor steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation,and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.25 Table of Contents TheEffect Of Recent Changes To U.S. Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results.Weoffer eligible full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us. For various reasons, manyof our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. healthcare reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase ourlabor costs significantly. The law, in certain circumstances, imposes a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage,which may result in employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in our healthcare plans to now find it advantageousto do so, which may increase our healthcare costs. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likelyto impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determinedwith certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results. IfWe Experience a  Significant Failure in or Interruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Businesscould be Adversely Impacted.We use a variety of applications and systems to securelymanage the flow of information within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure. The servicesavailable within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling, training,human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarilyon a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records salestransactions, receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allowsemployees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured fromthis system at each restaurant or store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continuallymonitor operating results. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliabilityand capacity of these and other systems, and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale systemand related networks and applications. These systems may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses andother disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events.Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whether from security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitionsto new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptions to or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adverselyimpacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negatively impacting our ability to manage our business. If ourinformation technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures,or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues andprofits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition,remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. Governmental regulationin one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including by harmingour ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs. Employment and ImmigrationRegulationsWeare subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to ouremployees, including wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, familyleave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship orwork authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers’ compensation rules and anti-discriminationlaws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us toliabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuits have been filed against us allegingviolations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We could suffer losses from and weincur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. Inaddition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimumwage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase ourlabor costs. Changes in US healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare andbenefit costs or increased compliance expenses.Wealso are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. Fromtime to time, the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department ofHomeland Security from time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcementprograms as well. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance andoversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availabilityof potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencingtheir employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currentlyparticipate in the “E-Verify” program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government toverify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that wewill properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines orpenalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make it more difficult to hireand keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees would disrupt our operations includingslowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as wetrain new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we didnot fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputationand financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.26 Table of Contents Onthe other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to havea disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could befound to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity relatedto work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it moredifficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs ordifficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.Additionally,while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of otherrestaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increaseand our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in laborlaws, including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihoodof some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our businessand financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact ouremployee culture.Americans with DisabilitiesAct and Similar State LawsWeare subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individualswith disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connectionwith ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access rampsor redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons underthese laws. The expenses associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating orresolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.27 Table of Contents Nutrition and Food RegulationInrecent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levelson the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casualsegments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictionsaround the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or makeother nutritional information available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reformlaw went into effect as of December 1, 2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customersas they select their food and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customer buying habitsin a way that adversely impacts our sales. Privacy/CybersecurityWeare required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as partof some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levelsand the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and informationsystems are compromised or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the impositionof penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adverselyaffected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract andkeep qualified employees.Local Licensure, Zoningand Other RegulationEachof our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, foodand workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licensesor approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirementsof local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurantsin particular locations.Environmental LawsWeare subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, releaseand disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted acomprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted inthe future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expendituresthat we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws. 28 Table of Contents We could be party to litigationthat could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages andother remedies. We could become subjectto numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, workhours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similar matters, and we could become subjectto class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could file complaints or lawsuits againstus alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that wehave problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant industry hasbeen subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertisingpractices. Regardless of whether anyclaims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may diverttime and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materiallyand adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations,whether directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputationor prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.Our SuccessMay Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel.Our Chairmanand Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002.August Bucci and Jeffrey Kastner, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, have also served withus since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci and since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastner, and much of our growth has occurred under theirdirection as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at ourcompany that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believethat it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision.If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessfulin executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy, our growth prospects or future operatingresults may be adversely impacted"
11,BDL,FLANIGANS ENTERPRISES INC,2017-12-21,"Risk Factors
 An investment in our commonstock involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and allother information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additionalrisks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referencedherein, may also become material and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of anyof the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our commonstock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment. Certain statements in thisreport contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow,capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflectmanagement’s current expectations regarding future events and use words such as “anticipate”, “believe”,“expect”, “may”, “will” and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of thedate they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from thoseexpressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materiallyfrom management’s expectations. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they mayarise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this reportas a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations. OurSales and Profit Growth Could be Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We MayNot Successfully Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales or They May Decrease. While future salesgrowth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the changein period-over-period sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affectingprofit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant salesincreases enable fixed costs 18 Table of Contents to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can havea significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparablerestaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2018 due to, amongother things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. Our ability toincrease comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including: ● perceptionsof the Flanigans’ brand;● competition,especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and from other restaurantswhose strategies overlap ours;● executing ourstrategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies;● changes in consumerpreferences and discretionary spending; and● our abilityto increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business;As a result itis possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant salescould be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustaincomparable restaurant sales increases. High Unemployment,Instability in the Housing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in ConsumerDiscretionary Spending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions(including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability inthe housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen, ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The RestaurantAnd Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability.        The restaurant and packageliquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and locationand many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-establishedcompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitorsare well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally,other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. 19 Table of Contents Any inability to successfullycompete with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues andprofitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular newrestaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementingthese modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability. New InformationOr Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely AffectOur Revenues. Regulations andconsumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may includeregulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number ofstates, counties and cities are enacting menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritionalinformation available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurantoperations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulationsand to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly,we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to ourmenu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.Adverse PublicOr Medical Opinions About Health Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/OrPackage Liquor Stores And About Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could NegativelyAffect Us. Restaurant operatorshave received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consumingcertain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of thoseitems could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, offood quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited numberof restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industryoverall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of these types of health concerns or negativepublicity could materially harm our results of operations. 20 Table of Contents Our InabilityTo Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements,construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted byconsumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected.However, we have not experienced any adverse affects from past menu price increases. Increasesin Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other Supplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins dependon, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including foodand beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements forour principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we arecurrently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can besubject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost ofkey inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to governmentregulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higherminimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costsfor goods and services supplied to us. Our BusinessCould Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner To grow successfully, wemust open new restaurants on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to timeand may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal years 2017 and 2016 we had no new restaurants under development. Wecurrently do not have any new restaurants under development. Our ability to open andprofitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availabilityof suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations,the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits(including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessarycontractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedulesand budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in constructiondelays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount oftime. 21 Table of Contents If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues whichwill materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Changes InCustomer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, sidedishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. Achange from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. Our SuccessDepends Substantially on the Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have builta reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants.We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodesconsumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality,service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. Labor Shortages,An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business Our employees are essentialto our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retainenough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyabledining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us topay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. IncreasesIn Employee Minimum Wages By The Federal Or State Government Could Adversely Affect Business Certain of our Companyemployees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annualcost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since ourbusiness is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which couldharm our financial performance. Due To OurGeographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations All but one (1) of ourrestaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. Duringhurricane season, (June 1st through November 30th each year), 22 Table of Contents our restaurants and/or package liquor storesmay face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficultfor customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores, or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurantsfor a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating resultsmay be negatively affected. If We Wereto Experience Widespread Difficulty Renewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be AdverselyAffected. Mostof the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal orextension options in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursuethe renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases,or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurantsdue to difficulties in renewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitablereplacement restaurants. Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducingour restaurant margins. Due To OurGeographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At AReasonable Rate Due to the anticipatedactive hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurantand package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonablerates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, thenwe will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which mayhave a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. InabilityTo Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of Operations We take pride in our abilityto attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not returnand results may be negatively affected. Failure ToComply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulationby federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departmentsrelating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to:    ●the environment;23 Table of Contents  ●building construction; ●zoning requirements; ●the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; and ●employment. Our facilities are licensedand subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants willbe subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessarylicenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. Various federal and statelabor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefitand work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of manyof our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employeesmay not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. Our business can be adverselyaffected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borneillness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicitycould negatively impact public perception of our brands. We are required to complywith the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located.Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipalauthorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revokedor suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations ofthe restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventorycontrol and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations,our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection withthe construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities. Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. 24 Table of Contents We May Face Liability Under Dram Shop Statutes Our sale of alcoholicbeverages subjects us to “dram shop” statutes. These statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishmentthat served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage,or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materiallyand adversely affected. We currently have three “dram shop” claims, which we are defending vigorously. See “Item1. Business—Government Regulation” for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply. We May Face Instances Of Food Borne Illness In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach,which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidentsof “mad cow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (suchas, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adverselyaffect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales coulddecline.Instances of food-borneillnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity aboutus or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or otherkey aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attractenough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borneillnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concernsor negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants,could materially harm our business. If We AreUnable To Protect Our Customers’ Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our ReputationCould Be Significantly Harmed. In connection with creditcard sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use privatenetworks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connectionwith credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others fromobtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroyor steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation,and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.25 Table of Contents The EffectOf Recent Changes To U.S. Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results. Weoffer eligible full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us. For various reasons, manyof our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. healthcare reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase ourlabor costs significantly. The law, in certain circumstances, imposes a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage,which may result in employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in our healthcare plans to now find it advantageousto do so, which may increase our healthcare costs. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likelyto impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determinedwith certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results. Governmental regulationin one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including by harmingour ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs. Employment and ImmigrationRegulationsWeare subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, includingwage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regardingworking conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insuranceand workers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expenseand can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuitshave been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We couldsuffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could besignificant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enactedminimum wage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increaseour labor costs.Wealso are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. Floridais considering adopting new immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consideror implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration or work authorizationlaws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiringprocess more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us withgovernment-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, beunauthorized workers. We currently participate in the “E-Verify” program, an Internet-based, free program run by 26 Table of Contents theU.S. government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guaranteethat we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines orpenalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire andkeep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughputand could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We couldalso become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeepingobligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmedas a result of any of these factors.Onthe other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to havea disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could befound to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity relatedto work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it moredifficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs ordifficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.Additionally,while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of otherrestaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increaseand our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in laborlaws, including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihoodof some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our businessand financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact ouremployee culture.Americans with DisabilitiesAct and Similar State LawsWeare subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individualswith disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connectionwith ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access rampsor redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons underthese laws. The expenses associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating orresolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.Nutrition and Food RegulationInrecent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levelson the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casualsegments have been a 27 Table of Contents particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictionsaround the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or makeother nutritional information available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reformlaw went into effect as of December 1, 2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customersas they select their food and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customer buying habitsin a way that adversely impacts our sales. Privacy/CybersecurityWeare required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as partof some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levelsand the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and informationsystems are compromised or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the impositionof penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adverselyaffected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract andkeep qualified employees.Local Licensure, Zoningand Other RegulationEachof our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, foodand workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licensesor approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirementsof local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurantsin particular locations.Environmental LawsWeare subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, releaseand disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted acomprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted inthe future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expendituresthat we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws. We could be party to litigationthat could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages andother remedies. We could become subjectto numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, workhours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similar matters, and we could become subjectto 28 Table of Contents class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could file complaints or lawsuits againstus alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that wehave problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant industry hasbeen subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertisingpractices. Regardless of whether anyclaims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may diverttime and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materiallyand adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations,whether directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputationor prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.OurSuccess May Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel.Our Chairmanand Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002.August Bucci and Jeffrey Kastner, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, have also served withus since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci and since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastner, and much of our growth has occurred under theirdirection as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at ourcompany that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believethat it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision.If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessfulin executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy, our growth prospects or future operatingresults may be adversely impacted"

This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant salesincreases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can havea significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparablerestaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2017 due to, amongother things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty. Our ability to increasecomparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including:—perceptions of the Flanigans’ brand;— competition, especiallyfrom an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and from other restaurants whosestrategies overlap ours;— executing our strategieseffectively, including our marketing and branding strategies;— changes in consumerpreferences and discretionary spending; and— our abilityto increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business; As a resultit is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant salescould be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustaincomparable restaurant sales increases.18 Table of Contents High Unemployment,Instability in the Housing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in ConsumerDiscretionary Spending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions(including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability inthe housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen, ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The RestaurantAnd Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. The restaurant and packageliquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and locationand many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-establishedcompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitorsare well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally,other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to successfullycompete with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues andprofitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular newrestaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementingthese modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability. New InformationOr Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely AffectOur Revenues.        Regulations andconsumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may includeregulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number ofstates, counties and cities are enacting menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritionalinformation available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurantoperations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulationsand to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly,we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to ourmenu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.19 Table of Contents Adverse PublicOr Medical Opinions About Health Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/OrPackage Liquor Stores And About Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could NegativelyAffect Us.  Restaurant operatorshave received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consumingcertain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of thoseitems could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, offood quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited numberof restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industryoverall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of these types of health concerns or negativepublicity could materially harm our results of operations.Our InabilityTo Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability.   We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements,construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted byconsumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected.However, we have not experienced any adverse affects from past menu price increases. Increasesin Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other Supplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins dependon, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including foodand beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements forour principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we arecurrently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can besubject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost ofkey inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to governmentregulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higherminimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costsfor goods and services supplied to us. 20 Table of Contents Our BusinessCould Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner To grow successfully, wemust open new restaurants on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to timeand may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal years 2016 and 2015 we had no new restaurants under development. Wecurrently do not have any new restaurants under development. Our ability to open andprofitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availabilityof suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations,the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits(including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessarycontractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedulesand budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in constructiondelays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount oftime. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues whichwill materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Changes InCustomer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, sidedishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. Achange from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. Our SuccessDepends Substantially on the Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have builta reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants.We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodesconsumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality,service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. Labor Shortages,An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business Our employees are essentialto our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retainenough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyabledining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us topay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. 21 Table of Contents IncreasesIn Employee Minimum Wages By The Federal Or State Government Could Adversely Affect Business Certain of our Companyemployees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annualcost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since ourbusiness is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which couldharm our financial performance. Due To OurGeographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations All but one (1) of ourrestaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. Duringhurricane season, (June 1st through November 30th each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor storesmay face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficultfor customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores, or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurantsfor a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating resultsmay be negatively affected.  If We Wereto Experience Widespread Difficulty Renewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be AdverselyAffected. Mostof the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal orextension options in the next several years. Some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value, which could involve substantialincreases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantiallyall of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increasein rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties inrenewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants.Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins.  22 Table of Contents Due To OurGeographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At AReasonable Rate Due to the anticipatedactive hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurantand package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonablerates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, thenwe will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which mayhave a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. InabilityTo Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of Operations We take pride in our abilityto attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not returnand results may be negatively affected. Failure ToComply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulationby federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departmentsrelating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to:    ●the environment; ●building construction; ●zoning requirements; ●the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; and ●employment. Our facilities are licensedand subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants willbe subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessarylicenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. Various federal and statelabor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefitand work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of manyof our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employeesmay not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. Our business can be adverselyaffected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borneillness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicitycould negatively impact public perception of our brands. 23 Table of Contents We are required to complywith the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located.Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipalauthorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revokedor suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations ofthe restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventorycontrol and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations,our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection withthe construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities. Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. We May Face Liability Under Dram Shop Statutes Our sale of alcoholicbeverages subjects us to “dram shop” statutes. These statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishmentthat served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage,or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materiallyand adversely affected. We currently have four “dram shop” claims, which we are defending vigorously. See “Item1. Business—Government Regulation” for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply. We May Face Instances Of Food Borne Illness In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach,which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidentsof “mad cow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (suchas, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adverselyaffect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales coulddecline.24 Table of Contents Instances of food-borneillnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity aboutus or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or otherkey aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attractenough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borneillnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concernsor negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants,could materially harm our business. If We AreUnable To Protect Our Customers’ Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our ReputationCould Be Significantly Harmed. In connection with creditcard sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use privatenetworks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connectionwith credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others fromobtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroyor steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation,and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. The EffectOf Recent Changes To U.S. Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results. Weoffer eligible full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us. For various reasons, manyof our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. healthcare reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase ourlabor costs significantly. The law, in certain circumstances, imposes a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage,which may result in employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in our healthcare plans to now find it advantageousto do so, which may increase our healthcare costs. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likelyto impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determinedwith certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results. Governmental regulationin one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including by harmingour ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs.  25 Table of Contents  Employment and ImmigrationRegulationsWeare subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, includingwage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regardingworking conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insuranceand workers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expenseand can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuitshave been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We couldsuffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could besignificant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enactedminimum wage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increaseour labor costs.Wealso are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. Floridais considering adopting new immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consideror implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration or work authorizationlaws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiringprocess more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us withgovernment-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, beunauthorized workers. We currently participate in the “E-Verify” program, an Internet-based, free program run by theU.S. government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guaranteethat we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines orpenalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire andkeep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughputand could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We couldalso become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeepingobligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmedas a result of any of these factors.Onthe other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to havea disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could befound to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity relatedto work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it moredifficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs ordifficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.26 Table of Contents Additionally,while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of otherrestaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increaseand our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in laborlaws, including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihoodof some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our businessand financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact ouremployee culture.Americans with DisabilitiesAct and Similar State LawsWeare subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individualswith disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connectionwith ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access rampsor redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons underthese laws. The expenses associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating orresolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.Nutrition and Food RegulationInrecent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levelson the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casualsegments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictionsaround the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or makeother nutritional information available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reformlaw went into effect as of December 1, 2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customersas they select their food and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customer buying habitsin a way that adversely impacts our sales. Privacy/CybersecurityWeare required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as partof some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levelsand the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and informationsystems are compromised or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the impositionof penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adverselyaffected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract andkeep qualified employees.27 Table of Contents Local Licensure, Zoningand Other RegulationEachof our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, foodand workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licensesor approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirementsof local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurantsin particular locations.Environmental LawsWeare subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, releaseand disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted acomprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted inthe future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expendituresthat we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws. We could be party to litigationthat could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages andother remedies. We could become subjectto numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, workhours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similar matters, and we could become subjectto class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could file complaints or lawsuits againstus alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that wehave problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant industry hasbeen subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertisingpractices. Regardless of whether anyclaims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may diverttime and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materiallyand adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations,whether directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputationor prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.  Our Success MayDepend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel. Our Chairmanand Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002.August Bucci and Jeffrey Kastner, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, have also served withus since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci and since 1985 in the case of Mr. Kastner, and much of our growth has occurred under theirdirection as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at ourcompany that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believethat it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision.If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessfulin executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy, our growth prospects or future operatingresults may be adversely impacted. "

This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant salesincreases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can havea significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparablerestaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2016 due to, amongother things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty.18 Table of Contents As a result itis possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant salescould be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustaincomparable restaurant sales increases. ContinuedHigh Unemployment, Instability in the Housing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Resultin a Decline in Consumer Discretionary Spending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions(including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability inthe housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. Leading economic indicators, suchas unemployment and consumer confidence, remain volatile and may not show meaningful improvement in our fiscal year 2016. If economicconditions worsen, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The RestaurantAnd Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. The restaurant and packageliquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and locationand many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-establishedcompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitorsare well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally,other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to successfullycompete with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues andprofitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular newrestaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementingthese modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability.  19 Table of Contents New InformationOr Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely AffectOur Revenues. Regulations andconsumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health.

A decrease in guest traffic as a result of these types of health concerns or negativepublicity could materially harm our results of operations.Our InabilityTo Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements,construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted byconsumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected.However, we have not experienced any adverse affects from past menu price increases.  20 Table of Contents Increasesin Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other Supplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins dependon, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including foodand beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services.

Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higherminimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costsfor goods and services supplied to us. Our BusinessCould Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner To grow successfully, wemust open new restaurants on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to timeand may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal years 2015 and 2014 we had no new restaurants under development. Wecurrently do not have any new restaurants under development. Our ability to open andprofitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availabilityof suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations,the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits(including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessarycontractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedulesand budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in constructiondelays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount oftime. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues whichwill materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Changes InCustomer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, sidedishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. Achange from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. 21 Table of Contents Our SuccessDepends Substantially on the Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have builta reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants.We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodesconsumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality,service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. Labor Shortages,An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business Our employees are essentialto our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retainenough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyabledining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us topay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. IncreasesIn Employee Minimum Wages By The Federal Or State Government Could Adversely Affect Business Certain of our Companyemployees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annualcost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since ourbusiness is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which couldharm our financial performance. Due To OurGeographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations All but one (1) of ourrestaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. Duringhurricane season, (June 1st through November 30th each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor storesmay face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficultfor customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores, or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurantsfor a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating resultsmay be negatively affected.  22 Table of Contents If We Wereto Experience Widespread Difficulty Renewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be AdverselyAffected. Mostof the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal orextension options in the next several years. Some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value, which could involve substantialincreases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantiallyall of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increasein rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties inrenewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants.Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins. Due To OurGeographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At AReasonable Rate Due to the anticipatedactive hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurantand package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonablerates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, thenwe will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which mayhave a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. InabilityTo Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of Operations We take pride in our abilityto attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not returnand results may be negatively affected. Failure ToComply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulationby federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departmentsrelating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to:    ●the environment; ●building construction; ●zoning requirements; ●the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; and ●employment. Our facilities are licensedand subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants willbe subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessarylicenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. 23 Table of Contents Various federal and statelabor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefitand work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of manyof our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employeesmay not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. Our business can be adverselyaffected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borneillness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicitycould negatively impact public perception of our brands. We are required to complywith the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located.Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipalauthorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revokedor suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations ofthe restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventorycontrol and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations,our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection withthe construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities. Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. We May Face Liability Under Dram Shop Statutes Our sale of alcoholicbeverages subjects us to “dram shop” statutes. These statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishmentthat served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage,or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materiallyand adversely affected. We currently have four “dram shop” claims, which we are defending vigorously. See “Item1. Business—Government Regulation” for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply. 24 Table of Contents We May Face Instances Of Food Borne Illness In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach,which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidentsof “mad cow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (suchas, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adverselyaffect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales coulddecline.Instances of food-borneillnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity aboutus or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or otherkey aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attractenough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borneillnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concernsor negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants,could materially harm our business. If We AreUnable To Protect Our Customers’ Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our ReputationCould Be Significantly Harmed. In connection with creditcard sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use privatenetworks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connectionwith credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others fromobtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroyor steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation,and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.The EffectOf Recent Changes To U.S. Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results. Weoffer eligible full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us. For various reasons, manyof our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. healthcare reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase ourlabor costs significantly. The law, in certain circumstances, imposes a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage,which may result in employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in our healthcare plans to now find it advantageousto do so, which may increase our healthcare costs. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likelyto impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determinedwith certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results. 25 Table of Contents Governmentalregulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, includingby harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs. Employment and ImmigrationRegulationsWeare subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, includingwage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regardingworking conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insuranceand workers’ compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expenseand can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuitshave been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We couldsuffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could besignificant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enactedminimum wage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increaseour labor costs.Wealso are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. Floridais considering adopting new immigration laws and the U.S. Congressand Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations orenforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance andoversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability ofpotential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employmenteligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currently participate in the “E-Verify”program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughoutour company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment.Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts ourbrand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees woulddisrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increasesin our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related toclaims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputationand financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.26 Table of Contents Onthe other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to havea disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could befound to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity relatedto work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it moredifficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs ordifficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.Additionally,while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of otherrestaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increaseand our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in laborlaws, including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihoodof some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our businessand financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact ouremployee culture. Americans with DisabilitiesAct and Similar State LawsWeare subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individualswith disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connectionwith ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access rampsor redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons underthese laws. The expenses associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating orresolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material. Nutrition and Food RegulationInrecent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levelson the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casualsegments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictionsaround the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or makeother nutritional information available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reformlaw will go into effect as of December 1, 2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slowcustomers as they select their food and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customerbuying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales. 27 Table of Contents Privacy/CybersecurityWeare required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as partof some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levelsand the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and informationsystems are compromised or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the impositionof penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adverselyaffected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract andkeep qualified employees.Local Licensure, Zoningand Other RegulationEachof our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, foodand workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licensesor approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirementsof local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurantsin particular locations.Environmental LawsWeare subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, releaseand disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted acomprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted inthe future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expendituresthat we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws. We couldbe party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to materialmoney damages and other remedies. We could become subjectto numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, workhours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similar matters, and we could become subjectto class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could file complaints or lawsuits againstus alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that wehave problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant industry hasbeen subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertisingpractices. 28 Table of Contents Regardless of whetherany claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and maydivert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us couldmaterially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations,whether directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputationor prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.  "
1,BDL,FLANIGANS ENTERPRISES INC,2014-12-24,"Risk Factors
 An investment inour common stock involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertaintiesdescribed below, and all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchaseour common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deemsimmaterial and therefore not referenced herein, may also become  material and  may harm our business, financialcondition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial conditionand results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertaintiesand you may lose part or all of your investment. Certain statements in thisreport contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow,capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflectmanagement’s current expectations regarding future events and use words such as “anticipate”, “believe”,“expect”, “may”, “will” and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of thedate they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from thoseexpressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materiallyfrom management’s expectations. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they mayarise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this reportas a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations. Our Sales and Profit Growth Couldbe Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase ComparableRestaurant Sales or They May Decrease.  While future salesgrowth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the changein period-over-period sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affectingprofit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant salesincreases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can havea significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparablerestaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2015 due to, amongother things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty.16Table of ContentsAs a result itis possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant salescould be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustaincomparable restaurant sales increases. Continued High Unemployment, Instabilityin the Housing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer DiscretionarySpending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance.  Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions(including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability inthe housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. Leading economic indicators, suchas unemployment and consumer confidence, remain volatile and may not show meaningful improvement in our fiscal year 2015. If economicconditions worsen, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor StoreIndustry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. The restaurant and packageliquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and locationand many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-establishedcompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitorsare well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally,other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to successfullycompete with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues andprofitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular newrestaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementingthese modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability.17Table of ContentsNew Information Or Attitudes Regarding DietAnd Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues. Regulations andconsumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may includeregulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number ofstates, counties and cities are enacting menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritionalinformation available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurantoperations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulationsand to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly,we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to ourmenu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.Adverse Public Or Medical Opinions AboutHealth Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/Or Package Liquor Stores AndAbout Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us.  Restaurant operatorshave received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consumingcertain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of thoseitems could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, offood quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited numberof restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industryoverall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of these types of health concerns or negativepublicity could materially harm our results of operations.Our Inability To Successfully And SufficientlyRaise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. We utilize menu priceincreases to help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurancearrangements, construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are notaccepted by consumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could benegatively affected. However, we have not experienced any adverse affects from past menu price increases. 18Table of ContentsIncreases in Food Costs, Raw Materials andOther Supplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins dependon, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including foodand beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements forour principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we arecurrently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can besubject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost ofkey inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to governmentregulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higherminimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costsfor goods and services supplied to us. Our Business Could Be Materially AdverselyAffected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner To grow successfully, wemust open new restaurants on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to timeand may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2014 we had no new restaurants under development, while duringour fiscal year 2013 we had one new restaurant under development which opened for business on December 27, 2012. We currently donot have any new restaurants under development. Our ability to open andprofitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availabilityof suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations,the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits(including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessarycontractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedulesand budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in constructiondelays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount oftime. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues whichwill materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. Changes In Customer Preferences For CasualDining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, sidedishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. Achange from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. 19Table of ContentsOur Success Depends Substantially on theValue of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have builta reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants.We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future.

Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revokedor suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations ofthe restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventorycontrol and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations,our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection withthe construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities. Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. We May Face Liability Under Dram Shop Statutes Our sale of alcoholicbeverages subjects us to “dram shop” statutes. These statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishmentthat served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage,or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materiallyand adversely affected. We currently have two “dram shop” claims, which we are defending vigorously. See “Item1. Business—Government Regulation” for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply. 22Table of ContentsWe May Face Instances Of Food Borne Illness In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach,which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidentsof “mad cow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (suchas, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adverselyaffect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales coulddecline.Instances of food-borneillnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity aboutus or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or otherkey aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attractenough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borneillnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concernsor negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants,could materially harm our business. If We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers’Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed. In connection with creditcard sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use privatenetworks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connectionwith credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others fromobtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroyor steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation,and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.The EffectOf Recent Changes To U.S. Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results. Weoffer eligible full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us. For various reasons, manyof our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. healthcare reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase ourlabor costs significantly. The law, in certain circumstances, imposes a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage,which may result in employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in our healthcare plans to now find it advantageousto do so, which may increase our healthcare costs. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likelyto impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determinedwith certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results. 23Table of Contents"

  An investment in our commonstock involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and allother information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additionalrisks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial may also become importantfactors that may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following riskscould harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline dueto any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment. Certain statements in thisreport contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow,capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflectmanagement’s current expectations regarding future events and use words such as “anticipate”, “believe”,“expect”, “may”, “will” and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of thedate they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from thoseexpressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materiallyfrom management’s expectations. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they mayarise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this reportas a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations.18Table of ContentsOurSales and Profit Growth Could be Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We MayNot Successfully Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales or They May Decrease. While future salesgrowth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the changein period-over-period sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affectingprofit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant salesincreases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can havea significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparablerestaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2014 due to, amongother things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty.As a result itis possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant salescould be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustaincomparable restaurant sales increases. ContinuedHigh Unemployment, Instability in the Housing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Resultin a Decline in Consumer Discretionary Spending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance. Dining out is a discretionaryexpense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions(including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability inthe housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. Leading economic indicators, suchas unemployment and consumer confidence, remain volatile and may not show meaningful improvement in our fiscal year 2014. If economicconditions worsen, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Intense Competition In The RestaurantAnd Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. The restaurant and packageliquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and locationand many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-establishedcompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitorsare well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally,other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. 19Table of ContentsAny inability to successfullycompete with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues andprofitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular newrestaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementingthese modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability. New InformationOr Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely AffectOur Revenues. Regulations andconsumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may includeregulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number ofstates, counties and cities are enacting menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritionalinformation available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurantoperations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulationsand to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly,we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to ourmenu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.Adverse PublicOr Medical Opinions About Health Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/OrPackage Liquor Stores And About Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could NegativelyAffect Us. Restaurant operatorshave received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consumingcertain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of thoseitems could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, offood quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited numberof restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industryoverall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of these types of health concerns or negativepublicity could materially harm our results of operations.Our InabilityTo Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. We utilize menu price increasesto help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements,construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted byconsumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected.However, we have not experienced any adverse affects from our recent menu price increases. 20Table of ContentsIncreasesin Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other Supplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. Our operating margins dependon, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including foodand beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements forour principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we arecurrently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can besubject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost ofkey inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to governmentregulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higherminimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costsfor goods and services supplied to us. Our BusinessCould Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner To grow successfully, wemust open new restaurants on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to timeand may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal years 2013 and 2012 we had one new restaurant under development whichopened for business on December 27, 2012. We currently do not have any new restaurants under development. Our ability to open andprofitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availabilityof suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations,the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits(including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessarycontractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedulesand budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in constructiondelays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount oftime. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues whichwill materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. 21Table of ContentsChanges InCustomer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, sidedishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. Achange from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. Our SuccessDepends Substantially on the Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. We believe we have builta reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants.We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodesconsumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality,service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer. Labor Shortages,An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business Our employees are essentialto our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retainenough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyabledining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us topay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. IncreasesIn Employee Minimum Wages By The Federal Or State Government Could Adversely Affect Business Certain of our Companyemployees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annualcost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since ourbusiness is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which couldharm our financial performance. Due To OurGeographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations All but one (1) of ourrestaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. Duringhurricane season, (June 1st through November 30th each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor storesmay face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficultfor customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores, or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurantsfor a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating resultsmay be negatively affected. 22Table of ContentsDue To OurGeographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At AReasonable Rate Due to the anticipatedactive hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurantand package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonablerates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, thenwe will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, whichmay have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. InabilityTo Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of Operations We take pride in our abilityto attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not returnand results may be negatively affected. Failure ToComply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulationby federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departmentsrelating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to:    ●the environment; ●building construction; ●zoning requirements; ●the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; and ●employment. Our facilities are licensedand subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants willbe subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessarylicenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. Various federal and statelabor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefitand work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations.

We may not be able to obtain necessarylicenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. Various federal and statelabor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefitand work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of manyof our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employeesmay not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. 23Table of ContentsOur business can be adverselyaffected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borneillness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicitycould negatively impact public perception of our brands. We are required to complywith the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located.Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipalauthorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revokedor suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations ofthe restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventorycontrol and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations,our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. The Federal Americans withDisabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection withthe construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities. Failure to comply withthese and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. We May Face Liability Under Dram Shop StatutesOur sale of alcoholicbeverages subjects us to “dram shop” statutes. These statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishmentthat served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage,or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materiallyand adversely affected. We currently have two “dram shop” claims, which we are defending vigorously. See “Item1. Business—Government Regulation” for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply. 24Table of ContentsWe May Face Instances Of Food Borne Illness In years past, severalnationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach,which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidentsof “mad cow” disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (suchas, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adverselyaffect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales coulddecline.Instances of food-borneillnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity aboutus or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or otherkey aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attractenough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borneillnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concernsor negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants,could materially harm our business. If We AreUnable To Protect Our Customers’ Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our ReputationCould Be Significantly Harmed. In connection with creditcard sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use privatenetworks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connectionwith credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others fromobtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroyor steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation,and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. "
0,BDL,FLANIGANS ENTERPRISES INC,2011-12-28,"	Risk Factors
 An investment in ourcommon stock involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below,and all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additionalrisks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial may also become importantfactors that may harm our business, financial condition or results or operations. The occurrence of any of the following riskscould harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline dueto any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment. Certain statements inthis report contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cashflow, capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statementsreflect management’s current expectations regarding future events and use words such as “anticipate”, “believe”,“expect”, “may”, “will” and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of thedate they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from thoseexpressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materiallyfrom management’s expectations. 18Table of Contents  General Economic Factors May Adversely Affect Results Of Operations The disruption experiencedin the United States and global credit markets during the second half of calendar year 2008 and which continued into calendar year2009 has adversely affected domestic and global credit markets. During our fiscal year ended October 1, 2011, we received privatefinancing to purchase the real property and improvements of one (1) location upon which we operate a combination package liquorstore and restaurant. While the impact of the current crisis made it more difficult to obtain financing, we were able to procurefinancing but at a higher cost and upon less favorable terms than in the past. From an operating standpoint, our business is dependentto a significant extent on regional and local economic conditions, particularly those that affect our customers. In particular,where our customers’ disposable income available for discretionary spending is reduced (such as by job losses, credit constraintsand higher housing, taxes, energy, interest or other costs) or where the perceived wealth of our customers has decreased (becauseof circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, increased tax rates or other economic disruptions), our businesscould experience lower sales and customer traffic as potential customers choose lower cost alternatives or choose alternativesto dining out. These factors could reduce our sales and profitability. The current financial crisis has resulted in the need foradditional advertising and promotions to maintain our customer traffic.  Intense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From IncreasingOr Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. 	The restaurant and packageliquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and locationand many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-establishedcompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitorsare well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally,other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts. Any inability to successfullycompete with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues andprofitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular newrestaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementingthese modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability. 19Table of Contents  New Information Or Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes InRegulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues. 	Regulations andconsumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may includeregulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number ofstates, counties and cities are enacting menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritionalinformation available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurantoperations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulationsand to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly,we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to ourmenu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues. Adverse Public Or Medical Opinions About Health Effects Of Consuming Our ProductsAs Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/Or Package Liquor Stores And About Others Across The Food And LiquorIndustry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us. 	Restaurant operatorshave received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consumingcertain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of thoseitems could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, offood quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited numberof restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industryoverall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of these types of health concerns or negativepublicity could materially harm our results of operations. Our Inability To Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result InA Decline In Profitability. 	We utilize menu priceincreases to help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurancearrangements, construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are notaccepted by consumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could benegatively affected. However, we have not experienced any adverse affects from our recent menu price increases. 20Table of Contents  Fluctuations In Commodity Prices And Availability Of Commodities Including Pork,Beef, Fish, Poultry And Dairy Could Affect Our Business A significant componentof our costs are related to food commodities including pork, beef, fish, poultry and dairy products. If there is a substantialincrease in prices for these products and we are unable to offset the increases with changes in menu prices, our results couldbe negatively affected.  Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand InA Timely And Profitable Manner To grow successfully,we must open new restaurants on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to timeand may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal years 2011 and 2010, we did not open any new restaurants, nor do wehave any new restaurants under development. Our ability to open andprofitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availabilityof suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations,the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits(including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessarycontractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedulesand budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in constructiondelays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount oftime. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues whichwill materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.  Changes In Customer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect FinancialPerformance Changing customer preferences,tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, sidedishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. Achange from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business. 21Table of Contents  Labor Shortages, An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees CouldHarm Our Business Our employees are essentialto our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retainenough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyabledining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us topay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs.  Increases In Employee Minimum Wages By The Federal Or State Government Could AdverselyAffect Business Certain of our Companyemployees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annualcost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since ourbusiness is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which couldharm our financial performance.  Due To Our Geographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions ThatCould Affect Operations All but one (1) of ourrestaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. Duringhurricane season, (June 1st through November 30th each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor storesmay face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficultfor customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores, or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurantsfor a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating resultsmay be negatively affected.  Due To Our Geographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm InsuranceCoverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate  Due to the anticipatedactive hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurantand package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonablerates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, thenwe will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, whichmay have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. 22Table of Contents  Inability To Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of Operations We take pride in ourability to attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they maynot return and results may be negatively affected.  Failure To Comply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. We are subject to regulationby federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departmentsrelating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to:    ●the environment; ●building construction; ●zoning requirements; ●the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; and ●employment. Our facilities are licensedand subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes.

By 1970, we had established a chain of ""Big Daddy's"" lounges and package liquor stores between Vero Beach and Homestead, Florida. From 1970 to 1979, we expanded our package liquor storeand lounge operations throughout Florida and opened clubs in five other ""Sun Belt"" states. In 1975, we discontinued most of our package store operations in Florida except in the South Florida areas of Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe Counties. In 1982 we expanded our club operations into the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area as general partner of several limited partnerships we organized. In March 1985 we began franchising package liquor stores and lounges in the South Florida area. See Note 8 tothe consolidated financial statements and the discussion of franchised units on page 8.During our fiscal year 1987, we began renovating our lounges to provide full restaurant food service, and subsequently renovated and added food service to most of our lounges. Food sales currently represent approximately 81% and bar sales approximately 19% of our total restaurant sales. Our package liquor stores emphasize high volume business by providing customers with a wide variety of brand name and private label merchandise at discount prices. Our restaurants offer alcoholic beverages and full food service with abundant portions and reasonable prices, served in a relaxed, friendly and casual atmosphere.We conduct our operations directly and through a number of limited partnerships and wholly owned subsidiaries, all of which are listed below.  Our subsidiaries and the limited 6Table of Contentspartnerships, (except for the limited partnership, where we are not the general partner, which owns and operates our franchised restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida) are reported on a consolidated basis.        ENTITY STATE OFORGANIZATION PERCENTAGEOWNED        Flanigan’s Management Services, Inc. Florida 100        Flanigan’s Enterprises, Inc. of Georgia Georgia 100        Flanigan’s Enterprises, Inc. of Pa. Pennsylvania 100        CIC Investors #13, Limited Partnership Florida 40        CIC Investors #50, Limited Partnership Florida 17        CIC Investors #55, Limited Partnership Florida 48        CIC Investors #60, Limited Partnership Florida 45        CIC Investors #65, Limited Partnership Florida 28        CIC Investors #70, Limited Partnership Florida 41        CIC Investors #75, Limited Partnership Florida 13        CIC Investors #80, Limited Partnership Florida 27        CIC Investors #95, Limited Partnership Florida 30        Josar Investments, LLC Florida 100Package Liquor Store OperationsOur package liquor stores emphasize high volume business by providing customers with a wide selection of brand name and private label liquors, beer and wines while offering competitive pricing by meeting the published sales prices of our competitors. We provide extensive sales training to our package liquor store personnel.  Thestores are open for business six or seven days a week from 9:00-10:00 a.m. to 9:00-10:00 p.m., depending upon demand and local law. Approximately half of the Company's units have ""night windows"" with extended evening hours.Company Owned Package Liquor Stores.   We own and operate nine package liquor stores in the South Florida area under the name “Big Daddy’s Liquors”, four of which are jointly operated with restaurants we own.Franchised Package Liquor Stores.  We franchise four package liquor stores in the South Florida area, all of which are operated under the name “Big Daddy’s Liquors” and are jointly operated with our franchisee’s restaurant operations.  Threeof the four franchised package liquor stores 7Table of Contentsare franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors.  We have not entered into a franchise arrangement for either a package liquor store, restaurant or combination package liquor store/restaurant since 1986 and do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future.Generally, a franchise agreement with our franchisees for the operation of a package liquor store runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee’s lease for the business premises, extended by the franchisee’s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership.  In exchange forour providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service mark, “Big Daddy’s Liquors”, franchisees of package liquor stores pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately 1% of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2% to 3% of gross sales generated at the stores depending upon our actual advertising costs.Restaurant Operations.Our restaurants provide a neighborhood casual, standardized dining experience, typical of restaurant chains. The interior decor of the restaurants is nautical with numerous fishing and boating pictures and decorations. The restaurants are designed to permit minor modifications without significant capital expenditures. However, from timeto time we are required to redesign and refurbish the restaurants at significant cost.  Drink prices may vary between locations to meet local conditions. Food prices are substantially standardized for all restaurants. The restaurants' hours of operation are from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00-5:00 a.m. depending upon demand and local law.Company Owned Restaurants.  We own and operate seven restaurants all under our service mark “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” four of which are jointly operated with package liquor stores we own.Franchised Restaurants.  We franchise six restaurants, all of which operate under our service mark “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill”, two of which operate as a restaurant only and four of which operate jointly with a franchisee operated “BigDaddy’s Liquors” package liquor store.Generally, a franchise agreement with our franchisees for the operation of a restaurant runs for the balance of the term of the franchisee’s lease for the business premises, extended by the franchisee’s continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership.  In exchange for our providingmanagement and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service mark, “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill”, our franchisees pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately 3% of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2% to 3% of gross sales from the restaurants.For accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the revenue and expenses of our franchisees’ operations with our revenue and expenses.  Franchise royalties we receive are “earned” when sales are made by franchisees. 8Table of ContentsRestaurants Owned by Affiliated Limited PartnershipsWe have invested with others, (some of whom are or are affiliated with our officers and directors), in ten limited partnerships which currently own and operate ten South Florida based restaurants under our service mark “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill”.  In addition to being a limited partner in these limitedpartnerships, we are the sole general partner of all of these limited partnerships and manage and control the operations of the restaurants except for the restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where we only hold a limited partnership interest.Generally, the terms of the limited partnership agreements provide that until the investors’ cash investment in a limited partnership (including any cash invested by us) is returned in full, the limited partnership distributes to the investors annually out of available cash from the operation of the restaurant, as a return of capital,up to 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership, with no management fee paid to us.  Any available cash in excess of the 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership distributed to the investors annually, is paid one-half (½) to us as a management fee and one-half (1/2) to the investors, (including us), pro-rata based on the investors’ investment, as a return of capital.  Once all of the investors, (including us), have received, in full, amounts equal to their cashinvested, an annual management fee becomes payable to us equal to one-half (½) of cash available to be distributed, with the other one half (½) of available cash distributed to the investors (including us), as a profit distribution, pro-rata based on the investors’ investment.  As of October 3, 2009, limited partnerships owning three (3) restaurants, (Surfside, Florida, Kendall, Florida and West Miami, Florida locations), have returned all cash invested and we receive an annual managementfee equal to one-half (½) of the cash available for distribution by the limited partnership.  In addition to our receipt of distributable amounts from the limited partnerships, we receive a fee equal to 3% of gross sales for use of our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark, which use is authorized while we act as general partner only.  This 3% fee is “earned” when sales are made by the limited partnerships and is paid weekly, in arrears.  Althoughwe have no restaurants under development and whether we will have any under development in the future will be dependant, among other things, on market conditions and our ability to raise capital, we anticipate that we will continue to form limited partnerships to raise funds to own and operate restaurants under our service mark “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” using the same or substantially similar financial arrangement.Below is information on the ten limited partnerships which own and operate “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” restaurants:Pinecrest, FloridaWe are the sole general partner and 40% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Pinecrest, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since August 14, 2006.  15.0% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who areeither our officers, directors or their family members.  As of the end of our fiscal year 2009, this limited partnership has returned to 9Table of Contentsits investors approximately 34% of their initial cash invested, increased from approximately 18% as of our fiscal year ended 2008.Fort Lauderdale, FloridaA corporation, owned by one of our directors, acts as sole general partner of a limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since April 1, 1997.  We have a 25% limited partnership interest in this limitedpartnership.  58.8% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who are either our officers, directors or their family members.  This limited partnership has returned to its investors all cash invested, but since we are not the general partner of this limited partnership, we do not receive an annual management fee.  We have a franchise arrangement with this limited partnership and for accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the operations of this limitedpartnership into our operations.Surfside, FloridaWe are the sole general partner and a 45% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Surfside, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since March 6, 1998.  34.9% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who areeither our officers, directors or their family members.  This limited partnership has returned to its investors all of their initial cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half (½) of the cash available for distribution by this limited partnership. Kendall, FloridaWe are the sole general partner and a 41% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Kendall, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since April 4, 2000.  29.7% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who are eitherour officers, directors or their family members.  This limited partnership has returned to its investors all of their initial cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half (½) of the cash available for distribution by this limited partnership.West Miami, FloridaWe are the sole general partner and a 27% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in West Miami, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since October 11, 2001.  34.1% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons whoare either our officers, directors or their family members.  This limited partnership has returned to its investors all of their initial cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half (½) of the cash available for distribution by this limited partnership. 10Table of ContentsWeston, FloridaWe are the sole general partner and a 30% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Weston, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since January 20, 2003.  35.1% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who areeither our officers, directors or their family members.  As of the end of our fiscal year 2009, this limited partnership has returned to its investors approximately 73.75% of their initial cash invested.  During our fiscal year 2009, no distributions were made to limited partners as this limited partnership had limited positive cash flow generated by this restaurant.  The limited cash flow was primarily attributable to increased competition, which we expect to continue into our fiscalyear 2010.Stuart, FloridaWe are the sole general partner and 13% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in a Howard Johnson’s Hotel in Stuart, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since January 11, 2004. 31.0% of the remaining limited partnership interest is ownedby persons who are either our officers, directors or their family members.  As of the end of our fiscal year 2009, this limited partnership has returned to its investors approximately 22.5% of their initial cash invested.  During our fiscal years 2009 and 2008, no distributions were made to limited partners as this limited partnership had a net gain of $1,000 and a net loss of $8,000 from the operation of the restaurant during the fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively, before depreciationand amortization, and owed the Company $241,000 and $216,000, as of the end of our fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively, in advances made to meet operating losses.  As of October 3, 2009, the amounts this limited partnership owes to us have been offset with an allowance for doubtful accounts, in the amount of $241,000, on our balance sheet and is offset by an eliminating entry in consolidation in accordance with ASC 810 regarding accounting for consolidation.On October 1, 2009, the limited partnership operating the Stuart, Florida restaurant was served with a copy of a complaint, arising out of foreclosure proceedings commenced against the limited partnership’s landlord.  The limited partnership was named in and served with the complaint because it is the tenant on the propertywhich is the subject of the foreclosure proceedings.  As of October 3, 2009, due to the limited partnership’s inability to re-negotiate its three year renewal option, it leases the property on a month-to-month term. We do not know what the outcome of these foreclosure proceedings will be or what impact it will have on the limited partnership, but thus far no request has been made to have the limited partnership vacate the premises.  If the limited partnership were required to vacatethe Stuart, Florida premises, it would have a material adverse effect on its operations.  No assurance can be given that the limited partnership would be able to locate a suitable replacement location at reasonable rates and terms, if at all. 11Table of ContentsWellington, FloridaWe are the sole general partner and a 28% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Wellington, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since May 27, 2005.  25.7% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who areeither our officers, directors or their family members.  As of the end of our fiscal year 2009, this limited partnership has returned to its investors approximately 42% of their initial cash invested, increased from approximately 41% as of the end of our fiscal year 2008.Davie, FloridaWe are the sole general partner and a 48% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Davie, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since July 28, 2008.  9.7% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who are eitherour officers, directors or their family members.  As of the end of our fiscal year 2009, this limited partnership has returned to its investors approximately 7.0% of their initial cash invested.Pembroke Pines, FloridaWe are the sole general partner and a 17% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Pembroke Pines, Florida under our “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service mark since October 29, 2007.  17.9% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by personswho are either our officers, directors or their family members.  As of the end of our fiscal year 2009, this limited partnership has returned to its investors approximately 11.0% of their initial cash invested. As of the end of our fiscal year 2008, no cash had been distributed to investors.Management Agreement for “The Whale’s Rib” RestaurantSince January, 2006, we have managed “The Whale’s Rib”, a casual dining restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, pursuant to a management agreement.  We paid $500,000 in exchange for our rights to manage this restaurant.  The restaurant is owned by a third party unaffiliated with us.  Inexchange for providing management, bookkeeping and related services, we receive one-half (½) of the net profit, if any, from the operation of the restaurant.  The term of the management agreement, which commenced January 9, 2006, is for ten (10) years, with four (4) five (5) year renewal options in favor of the owner of the restaurant.  For our fiscal years ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, we generated $185,000 and $150,000 of revenue, respectively, from providing these managementservices. As of October 3, 2009, we have generated revenue in the aggregate amount of $603,000 since the effective date of the management agreement on January 9, 2006. 12Table of ContentsAdult Entertainment ClubWe own, but do not operate, an adult entertainment nightclub located in Atlanta, Georgia which operates under the name “Mardi Gras”.  We have a management agreement with an unaffiliated third party to manage the club.  Under our management agreement, the unaffiliated third party management firm is obligatedto pay us an annual amount, paid monthly, equal to the greater of $150,000 or ten (10%) percent of gross sales from the club, offset by one-half (1/2) of any rental increases, provided our fees will never be less than $150,000 per year.  For our fiscal years ended October 3, 2009 and September 27, 2008, we generated $170,000 and $238,000 of revenue, respectively, from the operation of the club.Operations and ManagementWe emphasize systematic operations and control of all package liquor stores and restaurants regardless of whether we own, franchise or manage the unit. Each unit has its own manager who is responsible for monitoring inventory levels, supervising sales personnel, food preparation and service in restaurants and generally assuring that theunit is managed in accordance with our guidelines and procedures. We have in effect an incentive cash bonus program for our managers and salespersons based upon various performance criteria. Our operations are supervised by area supervisors. Each area supervisor supervises the operations of the units within his or her territory and visits those units to provide on-site management and support. There are five area supervisors responsible for package liquor store, restaurant and club operations in specific geographicdistricts.All of our managers and salespersons receive extensive training in sales techniques. We arrange for independent third parties, or ""shoppers"", to inspect each unit in order to evaluate the unit's operations, including the handling of cash transactions.Purchasing and InventoryThe package liquor business requires a constant substantial capital investment in inventory in the units. Our inventory consists primarily of liquor and wine products and as such, does not become excessive or obsolete that would require identifying and recording of the same.  Liquor inventory purchased can normally be returnedonly if defective or broken.All of our purchases of liquor inventory are made through our purchasing department from our corporate headquarters. The major portion of inventory is purchased under individual purchase orders with licensed wholesalers and distributors who deliver the merchandise within one or two days of the placing of an order. Frequently there is onlyone wholesaler in the immediate marketing area with an exclusive distributorship of certain liquor product lines. Substantially all of our liquor inventory is shipped by the wholesalers or distributors directly to our stores. We significantly increase our inventory prior to Christmas, New Year's Eve and other holidays. 13Table of ContentsUnder Florida law, we are required to pay for our liquor purchases within ten days of delivery.During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2009, the package liquor stores we own and those owned by our franchisees began using a new point of sale computer system.  The cost of this new point of sale computer system, including hand-held, wireless scanners but excluding surveillance camera system, was approximately $287,000,all of which has been paid.  We are currently installing the surveillance camera system in all of our owned package liquor stores and those owned by our franchisees, which we estimate will be fully installed by the end of our fiscal year 2010 and cost an additional $118,000, in the aggregate.  As of October 3, 2009, surveillance camera systems have been installed in two of our package liquor stores at a cost of approximately $26,000, which has been paid.Negotiations with food suppliers are conducted by our purchasing department at our corporate headquarters. We believe this ensures that the best quality and prices will be available to each restaurant. Orders for food products are prepared by each restaurant's kitchen manager and reviewed by the restaurant's general manager before ordersare placed.  Food is delivered by the supplier directly to each restaurant. Orders are placed several times a week to ensure product freshness. Food inventory is primarily paid for monthly.Government RegulationOur operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. In particular, our operations are subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, alcoholic beverage control, safety and fire department agencies in the state or municipality whereour units are located.Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants and package liquor stores to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages from a state authority and in certain locations, county and municipal authorities.In Florida, where all of our restaurants and package liquor stores are located, most of our liquor licenses are issued on a ""quota license"" basis. Quota licenses are issued on the basis of a population count established from time to time under the latest applicable census. Because the total number of liquor licenses available under a quotalicense system is limited and restrictions are placed upon their transfer, the licenses have purchase and resale value based upon supply and demand in the particular areas in which they are issued. The quota licenses held by us allow the sale of liquor for on and off premises consumption. In Florida, the other liquor licenses held by us or limited partnerships of which we are the general partner are restaurant liquor licenses, which do not have quota restrictions and no purchase or resale value. A restaurantliquor license is issued to every applicant who meets all of the state and local licensing requirements, including, but not limited to zoning and minimum restaurant size, seating and menu. The restaurant liquor licenses held by us allow the sale of liquor for on premises consumption only. 14Table of ContentsIn the State of Georgia, where our adult entertainment club is located, licensed establishments also do not have quota restrictions for on-premises consumption and such licenses are issued to any applicant who meets all of the state and local licensing requirements based upon extensive license application filings and investigations ofthe applicant.All licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Suspension or revocation may result from violation by the licensee or its employees of any federal, state or local law regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of thedaily operations of our units, including, minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operations, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control, handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages, internal control and accounting and collection of state alcoholic beverage taxes.As the sale of alcoholic beverages constitutes a large share of our revenue, the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining a liquor license in a particular location could adversely affect our operations in that location and could impair our ability to obtain licenses elsewhere.During our fiscal years 2009 and 2008, no significant pending matters have been initiated concerning any of our licenses which might be expected to result in a revocation of a liquor license or other significant actions against us.We are subject to “dram-shop” statutes due to our restaurant operations and club ownership.  These statutes generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated individual. We carry liquor liabilitycoverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, which we believe is consistent with coverage carried by other entities in the restaurant industry. Although we are covered by insurance, a judgment against us under a dram-shop statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on us.Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship requirements and overtime.  Significant numbers of hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates related to the federal or Florida minimum wage, whichever is higher, and accordingly, increases inthe minimum wage will increase labor costs. We are also subject to the Americans With Disability Act of 1990 (ADA), which, among other things, may require certain renovations to our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements. The cost of any such renovations is not expected to materially affect us.We are not aware of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation under present consideration which would significantly limit or restrict our business as now conducted. However, in view of the number of jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and the highly regulated nature of the liquor business, there can be no assurance that additionallimitations may not be imposed in the future, even though none are presently anticipated. 15Table of ContentsGeneral Liability InsuranceWe have general liability insurance which incorporates a semi-self-insured plan under which we assume the full risk of the first $50,000 of exposure per occurrence, while the limited partnerships assume the full risk of the first $10,000 of exposure per occurrence.  Our insurance carrier is responsible for $1,000,000 coverageper occurrence above our self-insured deductible, up to a maximum aggregate of $2,000,000 per year. During our fiscal year 2008 and again in fiscal year 2009 we were able to purchase excess liability insurance at a reasonable premium, whereby our excess insurance carrier is responsible for $6,000,000 coverage above our primary general liability insurance coverage. With the exception of one (1) limited partnership which has higher general liability insurance coverage to comply with the terms of its lease for thebusiness premises, we are un-insured against liability claims in excess of $7,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate.Our general policy is to settle only those legitimate and reasonable claims asserted and to aggressively defend and go to trial, if necessary, on frivolous and unreasonable claims. We have established a select group of defense attorneys which we use in conjunction with this program. Under our current liability insurance policy, any expenseincurred by us in defending a claim, including adjusters and attorney's fees, are a part of our $50,000 self-insured retention.In accordance with accounting guidance, we accrue for any self-insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, our annual self-insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and circumstanceschange. Our self-insured accruals are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the caption ""Accounts payable and accrued expenses"". A significant unfavorable judgment or settlement against us in excess of our liability insurance coverage could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.Property Insurance; Windstorm Insurance; DeductiblesFor the policy year commencing December 30, 2009, our property insurance will be the second year of our two (2) year property insurance policy with our insurance carrier, including coverage for properties leased by us and our consolidated limited partnerships, and will provide for full insurance coverage for property losses, includingthose caused by windstorm, such as a hurricane.  For property losses caused by windstorm, the property insurance will have deductibles of 5% per location, per occurrence.   For all other property losses, the property insurance will have deductibles of $10,000 per location, per occurrence. Our insurance expense for the policy year commencing December 30, 2009, including insurance coverage for our consolidated limited partnerships, will be approximately equal to our insurance expense forthe policy year ending December 30, 2008, ($294,000), adjusted by changes we made to our insurable values.  Our insurance expense for the policy year which commenced December 30, 2008, including insurance coverage for our consolidated limited partnerships, ($294,000), decreased by approximately $140,000, (32%), from the policy year which commenced December 30, 2007, due primarily to decreases in premium rates for windstorm insurance coverage. 16Table of ContentsCompetition and the Company's MarketThe liquor and hospitality industries are highly competitive and are often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among package liquor stores isprice and that, in general, the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served.Our package liquor stores compete directly or indirectly with local retailers and discount ""superstores"". Due to the competitive nature of the liquor industry in South Florida, we have had to adjust our pricing to stay competitive, including meeting all competitors’ advertisements. Such practices will continue in the package liquorbusiness.  We believe that we have a competitive position in our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the ""Big Daddy's Liqours"" name.Our restaurants compete directly or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned.  Due to the competitive nature of the hospitality industry, we have had to limit our menu price increases, while offering our customary quality and quantity of beverage and food served, all at a reasonableprice.  We believe that we have a competitive position in our market because of widespread consumer recognition of the ""Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill"" name.We have many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned, with substantially greater financial resources and a longer history of operations than we do. Their resources and market presence may provide advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishmentsfor sites and finding management personnel.Our business is subject to seasonal effects, including that liquor purchases tend to increase during the holiday seasons.Trade NamesWe operate our package liquor stores and restaurants under two service marks; ""Big Daddy's Liquors"" and ""Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill"", both of which are federally registered trademarks owned by us.  Our right to the use of the ""Big Daddy's"" service mark is set forth under a consent decree of a Federal Court entered intoby us in settlement of federal trademark litigation. The consent decree and the settlement agreement allow us to continue to use and to expand our use of the ""Big Daddy's” service mark in connection with our package liquor sales in Florida, while restricting future liquor sales in Florida under the ""Big Daddy's"" name by the other party who has a federally registered service mark for ""Big Daddy's"" use in the restaurant business. The Federal Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the consent decree. We haveacquired registered Federal trademarks on the 17Table of Contentsprincipal register for our ""Flanigan's"" and “Flanigan’s Seafood Bar and Grill” service marks.The standard symbolic trademark associated with our facilities and operations is the bearded face and head of ""Big Daddy"" which is predominantly displayed at all ""Flanigan's"" facilities and all ""Big Daddy's"" facilities throughout the country. The face comprising this trademark is that of the Company’s founder, Joseph ""Big Daddy""Flanigan, and is a federally registered trademark owned by us.EmployeesAs of our fiscal year end 2009, we employed 903 persons, of which 688 were full-time and 215 were part-time. Of these, 40 were employed at our corporate offices in administrative capacities and 5 were employed in maintenance. Of the remaining employees, 39 were employed in package liquor stores and 819 in restaurants.None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining organizations.  We consider our labor relations to be favorable.EXECUTIVE OFFICERS              Name  Positions and Offices Currently Held  Age  Office or Position Held Since              James G.

University Drive, Hollywood, Florida, (Store #19), operates.  We paid $1,350,000for this property, $850,000 of which we borrowed from an unaffiliated third party, pursuant to a first mortgage.  The mortgage note bears interest at the rate of eight and one-half (8½%) percent per annum, is amortized over fifteen (15) years with equal monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $8,300.00, with the entire principal balance and all accrued interest due in eight (8) years.  (b)Purchase of Operating Assets from Franchisee (Boca Raton, Fl.)Subsequent to our fiscal year 2009, we purchased from our franchisee, the operating assets of the franchised restaurant located at 45 S. Federal Highway, Boca Raton, Palm Beach County, Florida for an aggregate purchase price of $245,000 and on October 18, 2009 this restaurant began operating as a Company-owned restaurant. The lease atthis location expires on April 30, 2011.  Our franchisee was unsuccessful in obtaining an extension of the lease term.  There can be no assurance that the lease term will be extended or that we will find a suitable replacement location at reasonable rates, if at all. Environmental Matters We are not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures.  However, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulationson our operations. Item  1A Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.  These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currentlyknown to management or that management currently deems immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business, financial condition or results or operations.  The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment. 19Table of ContentsCertain statements in this report contain forward-looking information.  In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow, capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.  Forward-looking statements reflect management’s currentexpectations regarding future events and use words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “may”, “will” and other similar terminology.  These statements speak only as of the date they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.  Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differmaterially from management’s expectations.General Economic Factors May Adversely Affect Results Of OperationsThe disruption experienced in the United States and global credit markets during the second half of calendar year 2008 and which continued into calendar year 2009 has adversely affected disposable consumer income and consumer confidence.  Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions ofeither or both of the financial and credit markets have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2009, we accessed the credit markets and applied for financing to purchase the real property and improvements of two (2) locations, upon one (1) of which we operate a combination package liquor store and restaurant and upon the other we operate a restaurant.  We also accessed the credit markets to extendthe maturity date of our line of credit.  While the impact of the current crisis made it more difficult to obtain financing, we were able to procure financing but at a higher cost and upon less favorable terms than in the past.  From an operating standpoint, the current financial crisis has resulted in reduced customer traffic in some or all of our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, reduced revenues and profitability, increased costs and imposed practical limits on our menu pricing.  Acontinued decline in same store restaurant revenues and/or profitability may result in a deterioration of our financial position.Intense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability.The restaurant and package liquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location and many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors with substantially greater financial,marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts.Any inability to successfully compete with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability and will result in a material adverse effect on  20Table of Contentsour business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in thefuture. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability.New Information Or Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues.Regulations and consumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health.  These changes may include regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants.  For example, a number of states, counties and cities are enactingmenu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants.  The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits.  If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, wemay be required to modify or delete certain menu items.  To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.Adverse Public Or Medical Opinions About Health Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/Or Package Liquor Stores And About Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively AffectUs.Restaurant operators have received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certain products.  An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those items could influence the demand for our offerings.  Inaddition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of food quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants,  restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our reputation.  A decrease in guest traffic as a result of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materially harmour results of operations. 21Table of ContentsOur Inability To Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability.We utilize menu price increases to help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction, utilities and other key operating costs.  If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduce guest traffic,or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected.Fluctuations In Commodity Prices And Availability Of Commodities Including Pork, Beef, Fish, Poultry And Dairy Could Affect Our BusinessA significant component of our costs are related to food commodities including pork, beef, fish, poultry and dairy products.  If there is a substantial increase in prices for these products and we are unable to offset the increases with changes in menu prices, our results could be negatively affected. Our Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable MannerTo grow successfully, we must open new restaurants on a timely and profitable basis.  We have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future.  During fiscal year 2009, we did not open any new restaurants, nor do we have any new restaurants under development.  Duringour fiscal year 2008, due to delays in the permitting process and construction, the Davie, Florida restaurant was opened after substantial delays.  Increases in labor and building material costs increased the cost of planned renovations to the Davie, Florida restaurant by approximately $1,000,000.Our ability to open and profitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of limited partner investors or other meansto raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of oneor more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time.  If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. 22Table of ContentsChanges In Customer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial PerformanceChanging customer preferences, tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance.  We offer a large variety of entrees, side dishes and desserts and its continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining.  A change from this dining stylemay have an adverse effect on our business. Labor Shortages, An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our BusinessOur employees are essential to our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers.  If we are unable to attract and retain enough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience, our results may benegatively affected.  Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs.Increases In Employee Minimum Wages By The Federal Or State Government Could Adversely Affect BusinessCertain of our Company employees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates.  Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annual cost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs.  In addition, since our business is labor-intensive, shortagesin the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which could harm our financial performance.Due To Our Geographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect OperationsAll but one (1) of our restaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida.   During hurricane season, (June 1st through November 30th eachyear), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms.  These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores, or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time.  If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected. 23Table of ContentsDue To Our Geographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable RateDue to the anticipated active hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurant and package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates.  If we are unable to obtainwindstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then we will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations.Inability To Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of OperationsWe take pride in our ability to attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not return and results may be negatively affected.Failure To Comply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation.We are subject to regulation by federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departments relating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to:  ●the environment;  ●building construction;  ●zoning requirements;  ●the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; and  ●employment.Our facilities are licensed and subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary licenses or other approvals on a cost-effective andtimely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future. Various federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefit and work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of many of our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurantsin strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employees may not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force. 24Table of ContentsOur business can be adversely affected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicity could negatively impact public perception of ourbrands.We are required to comply with the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholicbeverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and we may be forcedto terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. The Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection with the construction of new facilities and with significantrenovations of existing facilities. Failure to comply with these and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We May Face Liability Under Dram Shop StatutesOur sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to “dram shop” statutes.  These statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintain our insurancecoverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  We currently have no “dram shop” claims.  See “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation” for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply.We May Face Instances Of Food Borne IllnessIn years past, several nationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach, which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of “mad cow” disease have occurred in Canadianand U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could 25Table of Contentsin the future, adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference.  As a result, our sales could decline. Instances of food-borne illnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the dining experience we offer,we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business"
