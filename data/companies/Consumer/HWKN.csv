2,HWKN,HAWKINS INC,2009-06-05,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSYou should consider carefully the followingrisks when reading the information, including the financial information,contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Fluctuations in theprices and availability of commodity chemicals, which are cyclical in nature,could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the margins of ourproducts. Periodically, we experiencesignificant and rapid fluctuations in the commodity pricing of raw materials.The cyclicality of commodity chemical markets, such as caustic soda, primarilyresults from changes in the balance between supply and demand and the level ofgeneral economic activity. We cannot predict whether the markets for ourcommodity chemicals will favorably impact our operations or whether we willexperience a negative impact due to oversupply and lower prices.Our principal raw materialsare generally purchased under supply contracts priced according topredetermined formulae dependent on price indices or market prices. The priceswe pay under these contracts generally lag the market prices of the underlyingraw material. The duration of our supply contracts has shifted from annual toprimarily quarterly or monthly in duration as a result of recent pricingvolatility. In addition, the cost of inventory we have on hand generally willlag the current market pricing of such inventory. While we attempt to maintaincompetitive pricing and stable margin dollars, the variability in our cost ofinventory from the current market pricing can cause significant volatility inour margins realized. In periods of rapidly increasing market prices, theinventory cost position will tend to be favorable to us, possibly by materialamounts. Conversely, in periods of rapidly decreasing market prices, theinventory cost position will tend to be unfavorable to us, possibly by materialamounts. We do not engage in futures or other derivatives contracts to hedgeagainst fluctuations in future prices. We may enter into sales contracts wherethe selling prices for our products are fixed for a period of time, exposing us tovolatility in raw materials prices that we acquire on a spot market orshort-term contractual basis. We attempt to pass commodity pricing changes toour customers, but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so. Our inabilityto pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passingthrough price increases could adversely affect our profit margins. We are also dependent uponthe availability of supplies of our raw materials. In the event that rawmaterials are unavailable, raw material suppliers may extend lead times orlimit or cut off supplies. As a result, we may not be able to supply ormanufacture products for some or all of our customers. For example, in calendar2008 a miners strike in Canada significantly limited supplies of potassiumchloride, a key component of some of our products. Due to the resultingshortage, many chemical companies were unable to supply their customers. Whilewe were able to obtain a supply of the product sufficient to meet our needs andthose of our customers, we cannot assure you that such supplies would beavailable in the future should other similar shortages occur. Constraints onthe supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt our operationsand adversely affect the performance of our business.We operate in ahighly competitive environment and face significant competition and pricepressure. We operate in a highlycompetitive industry and compete with producers, manufacturers, distributorsand sales agents offering chemicals equivalent to substantially all of theproducts we handle. Competition is based on several key criteria, includingproduct price, product performance and quality, product availability andsecurity of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation withcustomers, and customer service. Many of our competitors are larger than we areand may have greater financial resources. As a result, these competitors may bebetter able than us to withstand changes in conditions within our industry,changes in the prices and availability of raw materials, and changes in generaleconomic conditions. Additionally, competitors pricing decisions could compelus to decrease our prices, which could adversely affect our margins andprofitability. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability isdependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of ourproducts by improving production efficiency and volume, shifting to highermargin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation andresearch and development. If we are unable to maintain our profitability orcompetitive position, we could lose market share to our competitors and experiencereduced profitability. Demand for ourproducts is affected by general economic conditions and by the cyclical natureof many of the industries we serve, which could cause significant fluctuationsin our sales volumes and results.Demand for ourproducts is affected by general economic conditions. A decline in generaleconomic or business conditions in the industries served by our customers couldhave a material adverse effect on our business. Although our sales volumescontinue to grow in areas traditionally considered non-cyclical such as watertreatment, pharmaceutical and food products, many of our customers are inbusinesses that are cyclical in nature, such as the industrial manufacturing,surface finishing and energy industries which include the automobile partsmarkets and the ethanol industry. Downturns in these industries could adverselyaffect our sales and our financial results by affecting demand for and pricingof our products. 4Our business issubject to hazards common to chemical businesses, any of which could interruptour production and adversely affect our results of operations. Our business is subject tohazards common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation,including explosions, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, mechanicalfailure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, chemical spills,discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and otherrisks. These hazards could cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damageto or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental contamination.In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilitiesdue to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goalsand result in a negative public or political reaction. Many of our facilitiesare bordered by significant residential populations which increase the risk ofnegative public or political reaction should an environmental issue occur andcould lead to adverse zoning actions that could limit our ability to operateour business in those locations. Accordingly, these hazards and theirconsequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole,including our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after theperiod of operational difficulties. Environmental, health and safety laws andregulations cause us to incur substantial costs and may subject us to futureliabilities. In thejurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous federal, stateand local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, includingthose governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, and themanagement and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. The nature of ourbusiness exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations dueto the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that cancause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment.Ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important considerationfor us and we invest substantial capital and incur significant operating costsin our compliance efforts. Governmental regulation has become increasinglystrict in recent years. We expect this trend to continue and anticipate thatcompliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures andoperating costs. If we violateenvironmental, health and safety laws or regulations, in addition to beingrequired to correct such violations, we could be held liable in administrative,civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions thatcould disrupt or limit our operations. Liabilities associated with theinvestigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury,property damages or natural resource damages arising out of such hazardoussubstances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations oflaws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly andseverally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than itsshare of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities can bedifficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficultto predict. We use, and in the past have used, hazardous substances at many ofour facilities, and have generated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastesat a number of our facilities. We have in the past, and may in the future, besubject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and theassociated liabilities may be material.Changes in our customers products or failure of ourproducts to meet customers quality specifications could adversely affect oursales and profitability. Our chemicalsare used for a broad range of applications by our customers. Changes in ourcustomers products or processes may enable our customers to reduce oreliminate consumption of the chemicals that we provide. Customers may also findalternative materials or processes that no longer require our products.Consequently, it is important that we develop new products to replace the salesof products that mature and decline in use. Our productsprovide important performance attributes to our customers products. If ourproducts fail to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications orhave a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could seek replacementof the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failingto perform as expected. A successful claim or series of claims against us couldhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results ofoperations and could result in a loss of one or more customers.Our business and ourWater Treatment Group in particular, is subject to seasonality and weatherconditions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our Water Treatment Grouphas historically experienced higher sales during April to September, primarilydue to a seasonal increase in chemicals used by municipal water treatmentfacilities. Demand is also affected by weather conditions, as either higher orlower than normal precipitation or temperatures may affect water usage and theconsumption of our products. We cannot assure you that seasonality orfluctuating weather conditions will not have a material adverse affect on ourresults of operations and financial condition. The insurance that we maintain may notfully cover all potential exposures. We maintainproperty, business interruption and casualty insurance, but such insurance maynot cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subjectto limitations, including deductibles and limits on the liabilities covered. Wemay incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurancepolicies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In addition,from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in the specialtychemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or,in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future, we may not beable to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increasesignificantly on coverage that we maintain. 5If we are unable to retain key personnel orattract new skilled personnel, it could have an adverse impact on our business.Because of thespecialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance isdependent on the continued service of, and on our ability to attract andretain, qualified management, scientific, technical and support personnel. Theunanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have anadverse impact on our business.We may not be able to successfullyconsummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into ourbusiness, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. As part of ourbusiness growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and may pursueacquisitions in the future. Our ability to pursue this strategy will be limitedby our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates and our financialresources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. The expenseincurred in consummating acquisitions, the time it takes to integrate anacquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully could result inunanticipated expenses and losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to realizethe anticipated benefits from acquisitions.To the extentfuture acquisitions are pursued, the process of integrating acquired operationsinto our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficultiesand may require significant financial resources that would otherwise beavailable for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Therisks associated with the integration of acquisitions include potentialdisruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management, unforeseenclaims and liabilities, unforeseen adjustments, charges and write-offs,difficulty in conforming the acquired business standards, processes,procedures and controls with our operations, and challenges arising from theincreased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of the expandedoperations.Our business is subject to risks stemmingfrom natural disaster or other extraordinary events outside of our control,which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results ofoperations.Naturaldisasters have the potential of interrupting our operations and damaging ourproperties, which could adversely affect our business. Since 1963, flooding ofthe Mississippi River has required the Companys terminal operations to betemporarily shifted out of its buildings four times, most recently in thespring of 2001 when our earnings were negatively impacted during that period byapproximately $200,000. No assurance can be given that flooding or other naturaldisasters will not recur or that there will not be material damage orinterruption to our operations in the future from such disasters.Chemical-relatedassets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possibletargets in the United States. Federal legislation is under consideration thatcould impose new site security requirements, specifically on chemicalfacilities, which may require increased capital spending or increase ouroverhead expenses. New federal regulations have already been adopted toincrease the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in theUnited States. We ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardousand we believe we have met these requirements, but additional federal and localregulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are beingconsidered. Bans on movement of hazardous materials through certain citiescould adversely affect the efficiency of our logistical operations. Broaderrestrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additionalinvestment and could change where and what products we provide.The occurrenceof extraordinary events, including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak orescalation of hostilities, cannot be predicted, but their occurrence can beexpected to negatively affect the economy in general, and specifically themarkets for our products. The resulting damage from a direct attack on ourassets, or assets used by us, could include loss of life and property damage.In addition, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all ofthe damage incurred or, if available, may be prohibitively expensive.We may not be able to renew our leases ofland where three of our terminals reside. We lease the land where ourthree main terminals are located. We do not have guaranteed lease renewaloptions and may not be able to renew our leases in the future. Our currentlease renewal periods extend out to 2018 (two leases) and 2029 (one lease). Thefailure to secure extended lease terms on any one of these terminals may have amaterial adverse impact on our business, as they are where the majority of ourbulk chemicals are stored. While we can make no assurances, based on historicalexperience and anticipated future needs, we believe that we will be able torenew our leases as the renewal periods expire.  "
0,HWKN,HAWKINS INC,2008-06-13,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS  You should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information, including the financial information, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Availability and fluctuations in the prices of commodity chemicals, which are cyclical in nature, could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products.  Periodically, we experience significant increases in the cost of raw materials. We attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers, but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so. Our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our profit margins. In addition to raising prices, raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies. Constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt our operations and adversely affect the performance of our business. Additionally, our profit margins may be reduced due to the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices. The cyclicality of commodity chemical markets, such as caustic soda, primarily results from changes in the balance between supply and demand and the level of general economic activity. The Company cannot predict with any certainty whether the markets for its commodity chemicals will favorably impact the Companys operations or whether the Company will experience losses due to oversupply and lower prices. We operate in a highly competitive environment and face significant competition and price pressure.  We operate in a highly competitive marketplace, competing primarily against other chemical companies.

Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability tooffset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume, shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development. If we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we could lose market share to our competitors.  Our business, and in particular our Water Treatment segment, is subject to seasonality and weather conditions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The Water Treatment segment of our business is seasonal, with higher sales recorded from April through September due to increased water usage during this time frame. Demand is also affected by weather conditions, as either higher or lower than normal precipitation or temperatures may affect water usage and the consumption of our products.

Many of our customers are in industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Historically, downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand and lower average selling prices, and we may experience similar problems in the future. A decline in economic conditions in our customers cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.  Our chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers. Changes in our customers products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the chemicals that we provide or make our chemicals unnecessary. Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products. Consequently, it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use.  Our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products. If a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as expected.

RISK FACTORS  You should consider carefully thefollowing risks when reading the information, including the financial information, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy, on a timely basis or at all, and the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices, could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products. Periodically, we experience significant increases in the cost of raw materials. We generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers, but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so. Our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our profit margins. In addition to raising prices, raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies. Constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt our operations and adversely affect the performance of our business.Additionally, our profit margins may be reduced due to the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices. The cyclicality of commodity chemical markets, such as caustic soda, primarily results from changes in the balance between supply and demand and the level of general economic activity. The Company cannot predict with any certainty whether the markets for its commodity chemicals will favorably impact the Companys operations or whether the Company will experience losses due to excess production resulting in oversupply and lower prices.We face competition from other chemical companies, which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace, competing primarily against a number of chemical companies. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources. These competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry, changes in the prices of raw materials and energy, and changes in general economic conditions. Additionally, competitors pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume, shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development. If we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we could lose market share to our competitors. Our business, and in particular our Water Treatment segment, is subject to seasonality and weather conditions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.The Water Treatment segment of our business is seasonal, as higher sales are incurred from April through September due to increased water usage. Demand is affected by weather conditions as either higher or lower than normal precipitation may affect usage. We cannot assure you that seasonality or weather conditions will not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition. Costs and difficulties in connection with our new enterprise resource planning system could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We implemented a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in October 2006. We are still completing the implementation of the ERP system throughout our company and have experienced some delays, extra costs and inefficiency. Because ERP systems are highly complex, implementation and the transition to the new system has resulted in additional unexpected costs and difficulties. For instance, as a result of the implementation there were significant changes in our internal controls, processes and procedures during the fiscal year ended April 1, 2007. To address these changes, we modified ongoing processes and controls during the implementation period. These modifications included putting in place a number of manual controls and procedures as management could not test or rely on certain of the internal controls that are part of the ERP system. Management is in the process of planning andimplementing actions to replace the majority of these manual controls and procedures with automated controls. As a result of the issues described above, we were not able to file our 10-Q report for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 by the filing deadline specified in the SECs rules and forms.  Additional future difficulties in the implementation of our new ERP system, including failure or inefficient operation of the new system, could impair our ability to access certain business and financial information. In addition, we may continue to experience difficulties in the transition to our new ERP system that could affect our internal control systems, processes and procedures. Should we experience such difficulties as a result of our new ERP system, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Page 4Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses, any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations. Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental contamination. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals. Accordingly, these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties. Our business is subject to risks stemming from natural disasters, which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations.Natural disasters have the potential of interrupting our operations and damaging our properties, which could adversely affect our business. Since 1963, flooding of the Mississippi River has required the Companys terminal operations to be temporarily shifted out of its buildings four times, the most recent being in the spring of 2001. This had a negative impact on earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 of approximately $200,000. No assurance can be given that flooding will not recur or that there will not be material damage or interruption to the Companys operations in the future from flooding.Downturns in our customers cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Downturns in the businesses that use our chemicals will adversely affect our sales. Many of our customers are in industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Historically, downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand and lower average selling prices, and we may experience similar problems in the future. A decline in economic conditions in our customers cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Changes in our customers products can reduce the demand for our chemicals. Our chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers. Changes in our customers products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the chemicals that we provide or make our chemicals unnecessary. Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products. Consequently, it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use. We incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts. Governmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years. We expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Violations of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines, penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices. If we violate environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, in addition to being required to correct such violations, we can be held liable in administrative, civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising out of such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, forexample, entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property. Such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict. We use, and in the past have used, hazardous substances at many of our facilities, and we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material. We also have generated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities. The nature of our business exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications. Our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products. If a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as expected. A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers.  Page 5The insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures. We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain. If we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business. The unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance is dependent on the continued service of, and on our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, scientific, technical, marketing and support personnel. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. As part of our business growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and may pursue acquisitions in the future. Our ability to pursue this strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates and our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. The expense incurred in consummating acquisitions, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully, could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions. To the extent this strategy is pursued, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include, among many others, potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; unforeseen claims and liabilities; unforeseen adjustments; charges and write-offs; difficulty in conforming the acquired business standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations; and challenges arising from the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including domestic and international terrorist attacks, and laws and regulations related thereto may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products. Chemical-related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the United States. Federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements, specifically on chemical facilities, which may increase our overhead expenses. New federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the United States. We believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered. We ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous. Bans on movement of hazardous materials through certain cities could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations. Broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we provide. The occurrence of extraordinary events, including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general, and specifically the markets for our products. The resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets, or assets used by us, could include loss of life and property damage. In addition, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or, if available, may be prohibitively expensive.We may not be able to renew our leases of land where three of our terminals reside. We lease the land where our three main terminals reside. In the future, we may not be able to renew our leases due to the fact that we do not have guaranteed lease renewal options. Our current lease renewal periods extend out to 2018 (two leases) and 2029 (one lease). This may have a material impact to our business, as this is where the majority of our bulk chemicals are stored. We believe that we will be able to renew our leases as the renewal periods expire based on historical experience and anticipated future needs.  "
4,HWKN,HAWKINS INC,2006-06-16,"ITEM 1A.                                           RISKFACTORSYou should consider carefully thefollowing risks when reading the information, including the financialinformation, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Ourinability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials andenergy, on a timely basis or at all, could have a material adverse effect onthe margins of our products.We areexperiencing significant increases in the cost of raw materials. We generallyattempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to ourcustomers, but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so. Our inability topass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing throughprice increases could adversely affect our profit margins. In addition toraising prices, raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies.Constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disruptour operations and adversely affect the performance of our business.Additionally, ourprofit margins may be reduced due to the cyclical nature of commodity chemicalprices. The cyclicality of commodity chemical markets, such as caustic soda,primarily results from changes in the balance between supply and demand and thelevel of general economic activity. The Company cannot predict with anycertainty whether the markets for its commodity chemicals will favorably impactthe Companys operations or whether the Company will experience losses due toexcess production resulting in oversupply and lower prices.Weface competition from other chemical companies, which places downward pressureon the prices and margins of our products.We operate in ahighly competitive marketplace, competing primarily against a number ofchemical companies. Competition is based on several key criteria, includingproduct performance and quality, product price, product availability andsecurity of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation withcustomers and customer service. Some of our competitors are larger than we areand may have greater financial resources. These competitors may also be able tomaintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do.As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes inconditions within our industry, changes in the prices of raw materials andenergy, and changes in general economic conditions. Additionally, competitorspricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices, which could adverselyaffect our margins and profitability. Our ability to maintain or increase ourprofitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offsetdecreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving productionefficiency and volume, shifting to higher margin chemical products and improvingexisting products through innovation and research and development. If we areunable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we couldlose market share to our competitors.Ourbusiness, and in particular our water treatment segment, is subject toseasonality and weather conditions, which could adversely affect our results ofoperations.The WaterTreatment segment of our business is seasonal, as higher sales are incurredfrom April through September due to increased water usage. Demand is affectedby weather conditions as either higher or lower than normal precipitation mayaffect usage. We cannot assure you that seasonality or weather conditions willnot have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financialcondition.4 Costsand difficulties in connection with our new enterprise resource planning systemcould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We are in theprocess of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systemthroughout our company and have experienced some delays, extra costs andinefficiency. Because ERP systems are highly complex, implementation and thetransition to the new system has been costly and may initially result inadditional unexpected cost or difficulties, including failure or inefficientoperation of the new system. A failure in the new system could impair ourability to access certain business and financial information. In addition, wemay experience difficulties in the transition to our new ERP system that couldaffect our internal control systems, processes and procedures. Should weexperience such difficulties as a result of our new ERP system, our business,financial condition and results of operations could be materially adverselyaffected.Ourbusiness is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses, any of whichcould interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations.Our business issubject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation,including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanicalfailure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation,chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances orgases and other risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss oflife, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmentalcontamination. In addition, the occurrence of material operating problems atour facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet ouroutput goals. Accordingly, these hazards and their consequences could have amaterial adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including our results ofoperations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties.Ourbusiness is subject to risks stemming from natural disasters, which couldinterrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations.Natural disasters havethe potential of interrupting our operations and damaging our properties, whichcould adversely affect our business. Since 1963, flooding of the MississippiRiver has required the Companys terminal operations to be temporarily shiftedout of its buildings four times, the most recent being in the spring of 2001. Thishad a negative impact on earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 ofapproximately $200,000. No assurance can be given that flooding will not recuror that there will not be material damage or interruption to the Companysoperations in the future from flooding. In September 2001, a 1.5 million-galloncaustic soda storage tank was completed at the Red Rock facility, allowing itto serve as an additional terminal for bulk chemicals. Historically, the propertyon which the Red Rock facility is located has not been subject to flooding whenTerminals 1 and 2, located on opposite sides of the Mississippi River in St.Paul, Minnesota, were not usable due to high water, and the facility was notaffected by the most recent flooding in 2001. The Company believes the impactof future flooding, if any, will be reduced as the Red Rock Facility isexpected to allow the Company to continue normal shipping to customers duringperiods of high water levels.Downturnsin our customers cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales andprofitability.Downturns in thebusinesses that use our chemicals will adversely affect our sales. Many of our customersare in industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes ingeneral economic conditions. Historically, downturns in general economicconditions have resulted in diminished product demand and lower average sellingprices, and we may experience similar problems in the future. A decline in economicconditions in our customers cyclical industries may have a material adverse effecton our sales and profitability.Changesin our customers products can reduce the demand for our chemicals.Our chemicals areused for a broad range of applications by customers. Changes in our customersproducts or processes may enable our customers or reduce the consumption of thechemicals that we provide or make our chemicals unnecessary. Customers may alsofind alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products.Consequently, it is important that we develop new products to replace the salesof products that mature and decline in use.Weincur substantial costs in order to comply with the extensive environmental,health and safety laws and regulations.In thejurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous federal, stateand local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, includingthose governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, themanagement and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Ongoing compliancewith such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and weincur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts.Governmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years. We expectthis trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to requireincreased capital expenditures and operating costs.Violationsof environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may subject us tofines, penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain businesspractices.If we violateenvironmental, health and safety laws or regulations, in addition to beingrequired to correct such violations, we can be held liable in administrative, civilor criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could beimposed that could disrupt or limit our operations. Liabilities associated withthe investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personalinjury, property damages or natural resource damages arising out of suchhazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violationsof laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly andseverally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its shareof the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities may also beimposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardoussubstances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned oroperated the property affected and entities that arranged for the disposal ofhazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities thatcurrently own 5 or operate such property.Such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any suchliabilities can be difficult to predict. We use, and in the past have used,hazardous substances at many of our facilities, and we have in the past, andmay in the future, be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardousmaterials and the associated liabilities may be material. We also havegenerated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number of ourfacilities. The nature of our business exposes us to risks of liability underthese laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportationand sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury ifreleased into the environment.Wecould be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customersor lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certainquality specifications.Our productsprovide important performance attributes to our customers products. If aproduct fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications orhas a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could seek replacement ofthe product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing toperform as expected. A successful claim or series of claims against us couldhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results ofoperations could result in a loss of one or more customers.Theinsurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.We maintainproperty, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance maynot cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subjectto limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We mayincur losses beyond the limits, or outside coverage, of our insurance policies,including liabilities for environmental remediation. In addition, from time totime, various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemicalindustry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in somecases, have not been available at all.
