7,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2024-03-27," Risk Factors
: An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report, including the disclosures under “Forward-looking Information” above in evaluating our Company and any potential investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur or persist, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and value of our common stock. Risks Relating to Our Business: Continued high interest rates and inflationary conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our customers’ discretionary income or willingness to purchase discretionary items, which may adversely affect our business, margins, results of operations and financial condition.Continued high interest rates have adversely affected our customers’ discretionary income, in part due to increased interest costs associated with credit accounts including revolving credit accounts, car loans, mortgage loans and other credit accounts. In addition, the increased payments due to higher interest rates deter our customers from purchasing discretionary items such as apparel, shoes and jewelry. Continued inflationary pressures limit our customers’ willingness to purchase apparel, shoe or jewelry products, as prices associated with non-discretionary items, including food, fuel and shelter costs increase or remain high, reducing our customers’ discretionary income. Any reduction in our customers’ discretionary spending on our products could erode our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Because we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated with changes, disruptions, increased costs or other problems affecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain; the risks of conducting international operations and risks that affect the prevailing social, economic, political, public health and other conditions in the areas from which we source merchandise have and could continue to materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. 11A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in Southeast Asia. We are subject to supply chain disruptions affecting transit times and costs, including issues related to a sustained drought in Panama that is causing longer transit times through the Panama Canal and limiting the number of containers on a vessel due to vessel draft restrictions. We also face disruptions from issues related to vessels transiting the Suez Canal and Red Sea, which are being forced to travel a much longer distance around the Cape of Good Hope due to the hostilities in the Middle East. These continued issues have and may continue to drive up our ocean freight costs, delay merchandise deliveries, and impact our ability to access the already limited supply of ocean container shipping capacity that we require. We also are subject to domestic supply chain disruptions, including lack of domestic intermodal transportation (trucks and drivers), domestic port congestion, including increased dwell times for incoming container ships, lack of container yard capacity and lack of available drayage from the ports and other conditions that impact our domestic supply chain. These supply chain risks have and may continue to result in both higher costs to transport our merchandise and delayed merchandise arrivals to our stores, which adversely affect our ability to sell this merchandise and increase markdowns of it. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remaining merchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreign sources. Further, our third-party vendors are dependent on materials primarily sourced from China. As a result, we are subject to numerous risks that can cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. These risks include political unrest, labor disputes, terrorism, war, public health threats, including but not limited to communicable diseases (such as COVID-19), financial or other forms of instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting our supply chain, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or the imposition of, or changes in, laws, regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or governmental policies regarding or responses to these matters or other factors affecting the availability or cost of imports. In addition, geopolitical tensions, sanctions, prohibitions, additional tariffs, compliance and reporting requirements have resulted in increased costs associated with merchandise produced in certain regions. Any new sanctions, tariffs and reporting requirements enacted in the future may further increase our costs associated with sourcing products from those regions or limit our ability to procure the products we source, and our ability to source these products from other regions may be limited or result in increased sourcing costs. Our costs are also affected by currency fluctuations, and changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies have impacted and may continue to impact our cost of goods sold. Any of these factors can materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, increased energy and transportation costs have caused us significant cost increases from time to time, and future adverse changes in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise is transported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain, which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increased costs or potential disruptions impacting any port or trade route through which our products move, or we may be subject to increased costs and delays if forced to route freight through different ports than the ones through which our products typically move. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries or other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones we now sell. The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia presents increased operational and legal risks.  In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandise production to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company’s specifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the current business environment, including geopolitical issues, make operating in certain Asian markets challenging. To the extent we explore other countries to source our product or explore 12increasing the amount of product sourced from current countries, we may be subject to additional increased legal and operational risks associated with doing business in new countries or increasing our business in other countries. Further, the activities conducted by our sourcing offices outside the United States subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, in particular below under “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters - Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive consumer confidence and spending have and may continue to materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.  Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing social, economic, political and public health conditions and uncertainties (such as matters under debate in the U.S. from time to time regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies), levels of employment, fuel, inflation, interest rates, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, the availability of consumer credit, - consumer confidence and consumer perceptions of adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Any perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding them also generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, all of which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. In addition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual economic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or similar events, may also dampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Increased product costs, freight costs, wage increases and operating costs due to inflation and other factors, as well as limitations in our ability to offset these cost increases by increasing the retail prices of our products or otherwise, have and may continue to adversely affect our business, margins, results of operations and financial condition.Tight labor markets have caused wages to increase at the store, distribution center and home office levels, as well as making it more difficult to hire new associates and retain existing associates. The tight labor market and continued inflation also are driving up our operating costs. In addition, inflationary pressures on labor and raw materials used to make our products may continue to increase the cost we pay for our products. If we are unable to offset the effects of these increased costs to our business by increasing the retail prices of our products, reducing other expenses or otherwise, our business, margins, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our ability to raise retail prices in response to these cost increases is limited, in part due to our customers’ unwillingness to pay higher prices for discretionary items in light of actual or perceived effects of inflation in increasing our customers’ cost of essential items and diminishing customers’ disposable income, sentiment or financial outlook. Moreover, the persistence or worsening of inflationary conditions and high interest rates could also lead our customers to reduce their amount of current discretionary spending on our products even in the absence of price increases, which could erode our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 13Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry or events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to sporadic or market-wide liquidity problems that could adversely affect us. If any of our transactional counterparties, such as our merchandise vendors and their factors, our landlords, our payment processors including credit card, gift card and checks, our transportation vendors and other vendors that provide services and supplies to us, are unable to access funds or lending arrangements with such a financial institution, such parties’ ability to pay their obligations could be adversely affected. If this occurred we could be adversely impacted by not receiving the product we ordered or the payments generated by our sales, by not being able to receive products to our distribution center or our stores in a timely manner or at all, or by not being able to retain services from third parties that we require. These impacts may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to execute our business strategy. Furthermore, these adverse developments affecting the financial services or related perceptions may negatively impact our customers’ discretionary income or our customers’ willingness to purchase apparel, shoes or jewelry products. Any reduction in our customers’ discretionary spending on our products could erode our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Extreme weather, natural disasters, impacts of climate change, public health threats or similar events have and may continue to adversely affect our sales or operations from time to time.  Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters, physical impacts of climate change, public health threats or similar events can influence customer trends and shopping habits. For example, heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions, including but not limited to winter weather over a prolonged period, might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season can render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions would adversely affect our business. The occurrence or threat of extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or other communicable diseases (such as COVID-19) or other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations, which would materially and adversely affect us.  The long-term impacts of global climate change are expected to be unpredictable and widespread. The potential impacts of climate change present a variety of potential risks. The physical effects of climate change such as extreme weather and drought could adversely affect our results of operations, including disrupting our supply chain, the costs of our products and negatively impacting our workforce. In addition, the potential impacts of climate change present transition risks including regulatory and reputational risks. The potential cost of compliance with any future regulations may substantially increase our costs. For example, the use of certain commodities in the manufacture of our products and energy we use in our operations may face increased regulation due to climate change or other environmental concerns, which could increase our costs. Furthermore, any failure of or perceived failure by us to comply with any potential future climate change regulatory requirements including stakeholder expectations regarding the environment, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned. 14 Our sales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centers and malls where we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop. In addition, our ability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space for and open new stores in attractive locations. Shopping centers and malls where we currently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores have been and may continue to be adversely affected by, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularly affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores, changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shopping preferences, including but not limited to an increase in preference for online versus in-person shopping. To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shopping preferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores in desirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense. A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where we generally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centers and locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, has limited and could further limit our ability to open new stores, adversely affecting consumer traffic and reducing our sales and net earnings or increasing our operating costs.  Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals and hire and train appropriate store personnel. In addition, our continued expansion into new regions of the country where we have not done business before may present new challenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these stores to perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could materially suffer.  Customer tastes and fashion trends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tend to change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty. Our success depends in part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond to changing fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our image with our customers. If we miscalculate either the market for our merchandise or our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations. The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods on time and to the Company’s specification may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our dependence on third-party vendors to manufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that our vendors will fail to perform as we expect. For example, the deterioration in any of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandise in a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to follow our vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, including compliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us to operational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks. If we are not able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the United States further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed below under “Risk Factors
 – Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters - Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could 15result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Existing and increased competition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and market share.  The women’s retail apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores and internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices. In some cases, our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significant market presence. In addition, our competitors also compete for the same retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experience pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to open new stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our inability to effectively manage inventory has impacted and may continue to negatively impact our gross margin and our overall results of operations.  Factors affecting sales include fashion trends, customer preferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather, supply chain issues, actual or potential public health threats and economic conditions, including but not limited to continued high interest rates and persistent inflation. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of the applicable selling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we are not able to accurately predict customers’ preferences for our fashion items, we may have too much inventory, which may cause excessive markdowns. If we are unable to accurately predict demand for our merchandise, we may end up with inventory shortages, resulting in missed sales. Our inability to effectively manage inventory may adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations. Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.  Like most retailers, we experience significant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and managers. Moreover, attracting and retaining skilled personnel has become increasingly challenging in the tight labor market that has persisted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. To offset this turnover as well as support new store growth, we must continually attract, hire and train new store associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in our store operating efficiency and productivity. We compete for qualified store associates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companies in our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financial resources than we do.  In addition, we depend on key management personnel to oversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of our existing business and future expansion. The success of executing our business strategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for key management personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.  If we are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract, train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 16 The currently competitive environment for hiring new associates and retaining existing associates is causing wages to increase, which has affected and could continue to adversely affect our business, margins, operating results and financial condition if we cannot offset these cost increases. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of inventory have and may continue to result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be able to pass on to its customers.  The price and availability of raw materials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, currency value fluctuations, inflation, as well as other factors. Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue to have increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases in production costs may result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. Due to the Company’s limited flexibility in price point, the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer, which could have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations and financial condition. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate new businesses into its existing business, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.  The Company’s long-term business strategy includes opportunistic growth through the development of new store concepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures and management attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipated amounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costs related to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our stores are not successful and that have resulted in and could result in future impairment charges. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Risks Relating to Our Information Technology, Related Systems and Cybersecurity: A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.  We rely on our existing information technology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technology systems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems, including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets. Despite the precautions we take, our information systems are or may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerous events, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyberattacks, acts of war or terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control or that we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information technology systems, our failure to continue to upgrade or improve such systems, or the cost associated with maintaining, repairing or improving these systems, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current information technology systems may also disrupt our operations. A security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee, Company or customer information or a ransomware attack could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.  The protection of employee, Company and customer data is critical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programming error or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, including but not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiable information, could severely damage the 17Company's reputation, expose it to remediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt its operations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. The security of certain of this information also depends on the ability of third-party service providers, such as those we use to process credit and debit card payments as described below under “We are subject to payment-related risks,” to properly handle and protect such information. Our information systems and those of our third-party service providers are subject to ongoing and persistent cybersecurity threats from those seeking unauthorized access through means which are continually evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. Despite measures the Company takes to protect confidential information against unauthorized access or disclosure, which measures are ongoing and may continue to increase our costs, there is no assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of such information. If our measures are unsuccessful due to cyberattacks or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the Company may be subject to ransomware attacks, which if successful could result in disruptions to the Company’s operations and expose it to remediation and other costs, risks of legal proceedings, damage the Company’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or transportation network could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.  The distribution of our products is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through our network of third-party freight carriers. The merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by our third-party freight carriers. If the distribution center or our third-party freight carriers were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described above under “A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business,” our operations would likely be seriously disrupted. Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as well as any broader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center or deliver goods to our stores. As a result, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s failure to successfully operate its e-commerce websites or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impact customer satisfaction, our reputation and our business. Although the Company's e-commerce platform provides another channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers the online shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base, it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures in the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our websites, customer contact center or our distribution center, including system failures caused by telecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our present system capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error. Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security or data breaches involving the unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer information, as discussed above under “A security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee, Company or customer information or a ransomware attack could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.” We are also subject to risk related to delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such as shipping companies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdowns or adverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet the challenges of operating e-commerce websites or fulfilling customer expectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected. 18We are subject to payment-related risks. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including third-party credit cards, our own branded credit card, debit cards, gift cards and physical and electronic bank checks. For existing and future payment methods we offer to our customers, we are subject to fraud risk and to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increased costs and reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods). For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which have increased from time to time and may continue to increase over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. We rely on third-party service providers for payment processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these third-party service providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition, we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers and process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters: Continued scrutiny and changing expectations surrounding environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters from investors, customers, government regulators and other stakeholders may impose additional reporting requirements, additional costs and compliance risks. Public companies from across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from investors, customers, government regulators and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. In the U.S., there are various new rules or proposals for new or enhanced disclosure requirements regarding climate emissions, sustainability, workforce diversity and other human capital resources metrics, among other topics. Complying with these complex reporting obligations or expectations may increase our costs associated with compliance, disclosure and reporting. Furthermore, evolving ESG laws, regulations and stakeholder expectations may result in uncertain and potentially burdensome reporting requirements as stakeholders, agencies and government authorities adjust their expectations or change laws and regulations, such as the new rules regarding climate emissions reporting and auditing requirements. Failure to comply with all of the new rules and regulations and proposed regulatory requirements in a timely manner may adversely affect our reputation, business and financial performance. Changes to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.  U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and SEC accounting, disclosures and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant in the past several years. Changes in accounting rules, disclosures or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules, disclosures and regulations have significantly affected our reported financial statements and those of other participants in the retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Future changes to accounting rules, disclosures or regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position or perceptions of our performance and financial condition. If we fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 19 We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’s Fashion Metro”, “Versona”, “Cache” and “Body Central” trademarks are integral to our store designs, brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty. Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and have also registered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to our business, we cannot give assurance that these registrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others. Infringement of our names, concepts, store designs or merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our image could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, we cannot give assurance that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subject to lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannot predict; however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source our merchandise and operate our sourcing offices. Our business is also subject to regulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems for resolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisen and may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include, among other issues, intellectual property issues, employment issues, commercial disputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injury claims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, environmental laws, records and information management regulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting on the Company’s behalf may result in significant investigation costs, severe criminal or civil sanctions and reputational harm. These and other liabilities to which we may be subject could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significant management time. The Company may also be subject to regulatory review and audits, the results of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change from time to time. Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our operations and our reputation.  New legislation or regulation and interpretation of existing laws and regulations, including those related to data privacy, climate change or ESG matters could increase our costs of compliance, technology and business operations. The interpretation of existing or new laws to existing technology and business practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost. Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect our business and our financial condition. From time to time the Company is involved in litigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise in the normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, and could 20require significant management time. The Company’s periodic evaluation of litigation-related matters may change our assessment in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently known to us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We may also be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions or settlements of disputes may negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition. Maintaining and improving our internal control over financial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a public company may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controls may negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.  As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and related rule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have increased, and may continue to increase, our compliance costs and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the SEC’s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly and time-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot give assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws and regulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we may become subject in the future, as a public company could have an adverse material impact on our business, our financial condition and the price of our common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these existing and new requirements could significantly increase our compliance costs. Risks Relating to Our Investments and Liquidity: We may experience market conditions or other events that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, our short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and our revolving line of credit.  Our short-term investments and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state, municipal and corporate debt securities. The value of those securities may be adversely impacted by factors relating to these securities, similar securities or the broader credit markets in general. Many of these factors are beyond our control, and include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings, rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality of market credit and liquidity, potential disruptions in the capital markets and changes in the underlying economic, financial and other conditions that drive these factors. As federal, state and municipal entities struggle with declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of our ability to timely access these investments if the market for these issues declines. Similarly, the default by issuers of the debt securities we hold or similar securities could impair the value or liquidity of our investments. The development or persistence of any of these conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits. An economic downturn or development of adverse conditions affecting the financial sector and stability of financial institutions could cause us to experience losses on our deposits.  Our ability to access credit markets and our revolving line of credit, either generally or on favorable market terms, may be impacted by the factors discussed in the preceding paragraph, as well as continued compliance with covenants under our revolving credit agreement. The development or persistence of any 21of these adverse factors or failure to comply with covenants on which our borrowing is conditioned may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to access our revolving line of credit and to execute our business strategy. Risks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock: The interests of our principal shareholder may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company and otherwise affect our corporate governance and the market price of our common stock.  As of March 27, 2024, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned approximately 51.9% of the combined voting power of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Cato has the ability to substantially influence or determine the outcome of all matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and other business combinations or other significant Company transactions. Mr. Cato may have interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in a way with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to their interests. The concentration of voting power held by Mr. Cato could discourage potential investors from acquiring our common stock and could also have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change in control of the Company or other fundamental transaction, all of which could depress the market price of our common stock. In addition, Mr. Cato has the ability to control the management of the Company as a result of his position as Chief Executive Officer. We qualify for exemption as a “controlled company” from compliance with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance rules, including the requirements that we have a majority of independent directors on our Board, an independent compensation committee and an independent corporate governance and nominating committee. If we elected to utilize these “controlled company” exceptions, our other shareholders could lose the benefit of these corporate governance requirements and the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will choose to declare or be able to declare cash dividends in the future.  The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors regularly evaluates our ability to pay a dividend based on many factors, such as but not limited to, applicable legal requirements, the financial position of the Company, contractual restrictions and our capital allocation strategy. There can be no assurance that a cash dividend will be declared in the future in any particular amount, or at all. Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail apparel industry. As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters. Accordingly, our operating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularly relating to our industry, Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make its trading price more volatile.  The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps 22substantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as the following: low trading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; general conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the fashion and retail industry; conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securities analysts; negative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments; significant changes in our senior management team; and legal proceedings. Over the past several years the stock market in general, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Such fluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  "
10,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2023-03-23," Risk Factors
: An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report, including the disclosures under “Forward-looking Information” above in evaluating our Company and any potential investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur or persist, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and value of our common stock. Risks Relating to Our Business: Increasing interest rates and inflationary conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our customers’ discretionary income or willingness to purchase discretionary items, which may adversely affect our business, margins, results of operations and financial condition.Increasing interest rates have adversely affected our customers’ discretionary income, in part due to increased interest costs associated with credit accounts including revolving credit accounts, car loans, mortgage loans and other credit accounts. In addition, the increased payments due to higher interest rates deter our customers from purchasing discretionary items such as apparel, shoes and jewelry. Inflationary pressures limit our customers’ willingness to purchase apparel, shoe or jewelry products, as prices associated with non-discretionary products including food and fuel are increasing, reducing our customers’ discretionary income. Any reduction in our customers’ discretionary spending on our products could erode our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Increased product costs, freight costs, wage increases and operating costs due to inflation and other factors, as well as limitations in our ability to offset these cost increases by increasing the retail prices of our products or otherwise, have and may continue to adversely affect our business, margins, results of operations and financial condition.Tight labor markets are causing wages to increase at the store, distribution center and home office levels, as well as making it more difficult to hire new associates and retain existing associates. The tight labor market and inflation also are driving up our operating costs. In addition, inflationary pressures on labor and raw materials used to make our products may continue to increase the cost we pay for our products. If we are unable to offset the effects of these increased costs to our business by increasing the retail prices of our products, reducing other expenses or otherwise, our business, margins, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our ability to raise retail prices in response to these cost increases is limited, in part due to our customers’ unwillingness to pay higher prices for discretionary items in light of actual or perceived 11effects of inflation in increasing our customers’ cost of essential items and diminishing customers’ disposable income or financial outlook. Moreover, the persistence or worsening of inflationary conditions could also lead our customers to reduce their amount of current discretionary spending on our products even in the absence of price increases, which could erode our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Because we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated with international operations and risks that affect the prevailing social, economic, political, public health and other conditions in the areas from which we source merchandise; changes, disruptions, increased costs or other problems affecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain have and could continue to materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in Southeast Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remaining merchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreign sources. Further, our third-party vendors are dependent on materials primarily sourced from China. As a result, political unrest, labor disputes, terrorism, war, public health threats, including but not limited to communicable diseases (such as COVID-19), financial or other forms of instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting our supply chain, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or the imposition of, or changes in, laws, regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or governmental policies regarding or responses to these matters or other factors affecting the availability or cost of imports, can cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. In addition, geopolitical tensions, sanctions, prohibitions, additional tariffs, compliance and reporting requirements have resulted in increased costs associated with merchandise produced in certain regions. Any new sanctions, tariffs and reporting requirements enacted in the future may further increase our costs associated with sourcing products from those regions or limit our ability to procure the products we source, and our ability to source these products from other regions may be limited or result in increased sourcing costs. We are also subject to supply chain disruptions affecting ocean freight, including lack of overall ocean container shipping capacity versus the current demand for container shipping capacity, lack of our ability to access the ocean container capacity that we require, lack of equipment such as containers, port congestion, including increased dwell times for ocean container ships, and other conditions impacting ocean freight. We also are subject to domestic supply chain disruptions, including lack of domestic intermodal transportation (trucks and drivers), domestic port congestion, including increased dwell times for incoming container ships, lack of container yard capacity and lack of available drayage from the ports and other conditions that impact our domestic supply chain. These supply chain risks have and may continue to result in both higher costs to transport our merchandise and delayed merchandise arrivals to our stores, which adversely affect our ability to sell this merchandise and increase markdowns of it. Our costs are also affected by currency fluctuations, and changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies have and may continue to impact our cost of goods sold. Any of these factors can materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, increased energy and transportation costs have caused us significant cost increases from time to time, and future adverse changes in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise is transported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain, which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increased costs or potential disruptions impacting any port or trade route through which our products move, or we may be subject to increased costs and delays if forced to route freight through different ports than the ones through which our products typically move. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries or other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones we now sell. Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional 12counterparties, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to sporadic or market-wide liquidity problems that could adversely affect us. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank was swept into receivership. In addition on March 8, 2023, Silvergate Capital announced that it will liquidate its subsidiary, Silvergate Bank, and that the liquidation process is being supervised by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Although a statement by the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC stated that all depositors of SVB would have access to all of their money after only one business day of closure, including funds held in uninsured deposit accounts, borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other financial instruments with SVB, Signature Bank or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership by the FDIC may be unable to access undrawn amounts thereunder. If any of our transactional counterparties, such as our merchandise vendors and their factors, our landlords, our payment processors including credit card, gift card and checks, our transportation vendors and other vendors that provide services and supplies to us, are unable to access funds or lending arrangements with such a financial institution, such parties’ ability to pay their obligations could be adversely affected. If this occurred we could be adversely impacted by not receiving the product we ordered or the payments generated by our sales, by not being able to receive products to our distribution center or our stores in a timely manner or at all, or by not being able to retain services from third parties that we require. These impacts may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to execute our business strategy. Furthermore, these adverse developments affecting the financial services or related perceptions may negatively impact our customers’ discretionary income for or our customers’ willingness to purchase apparel, shoes or jewelry products. Any reduction in our customers’ discretionary spending on our products could erode our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive consumer confidence and spending have and may continue to materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.  Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing social, economic, political and public health conditions and uncertainties (such as matters under debate in the U.S. from time to time regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies), levels of employment, fuel, interest rates, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, the availability of consumer credit, inflation, consumer confidence and consumer perceptions of adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Any perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding them also generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, all of which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. In addition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual economic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or similar events, may also dampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  13Extreme weather, natural disasters, public health threats or similar events have and may continue to adversely affect our sales or operations from time to time.  Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters, public health threats or similar events can influence customer trends and shopping habits. For example, heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions, including but not limited to winter weather over a prolonged period, might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season can render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions would adversely affect our business. The occurrence or threat of extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or other communicable diseases (such as COVID-19) or other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations, which would materially and adversely affect us. Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned.  Our sales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centers and malls where we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop. In addition, our ability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space for and open new stores in attractive locations. Shopping centers and malls where we currently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores have been and may continue to be adversely affected by, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularly affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores, changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shopping preferences, including but not limited to an increase in preference for online versus in-person shopping. To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shopping preferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores in desirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense. A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where we generally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centers and locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, has limited and could further limit our ability to open new stores, adversely affecting consumer traffic and reducing our sales and net earnings or increasing our operating costs.  Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals and hire and train appropriate store personnel. In addition, our continued expansion into new regions of the country where we have not done business before may present new challenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these stores to perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could materially suffer.  Customer tastes and fashion trends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tend to change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty. Our success depends in part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond to changing fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our image with our customers. If we miscalculate either the market for our merchandise or our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required 14to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations. The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods on time and to the Company’s specification may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our dependence on third-party vendors to manufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that our vendors will fail to perform as we expect. For example, the deterioration in any of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandise in a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to follow our vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, including compliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us to operational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks. If we are not able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the United States further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed below under “Risk Factors
 – Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters - Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Existing and increased competition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and market share.  The women’s retail apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores and internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices. In some cases, our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significant market presence. In addition, our competitors also compete for the same retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experience pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to open new stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory have and may continue to negatively impact our gross margin and our overall results of operations.  Comparable sales are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors affecting comparable sales include fashion trends, customer preferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather, supply chain issues, actual or potential public health threats and economic conditions, including but not limited to increasing interest rates and higher inflation. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of the applicable selling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we are not able to accurately predict customers’ preferences for our fashion items, we may have too much inventory, which may cause excessive markdowns. If we are unable to accurately predict demand for our merchandise, we may end up with inventory shortages, resulting in missed sales. A decrease in comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations. The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia present increased operational and legal risks.  In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandise production to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company’s specifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 15In addition, the current business environment, including geopolitical issues, make operating in certain Asian markets challenging. To the extent we explore other countries to source our product or explore increasing the amount of product sourced from current countries, we may be subject to additional increased legal and operational risks associated with doing business in new countries or increasing our business in other countries. Further, the activities conducted by our sourcing offices outside the United States subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, in particular below under “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters - Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.  Like most retailers, we experience significant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and managers. Moreover, attracting and retaining skilled personnel has become increasingly challenging in the tight labor market that has persisted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. To offset this turnover as well as support new store growth, we must continually attract, hire and train new store associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in our store operating efficiency and productivity. We compete for qualified store associates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companies in our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financial resources than we do.  In addition, we depend on key management personnel to oversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of our existing business and future expansion. The success of executing our business strategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for key management personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.  If we are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract, train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  The currently competitive environment for hiring new associates and retaining existing associates is causing wages to increase, which has and could continue to adversely affect our business, margins, operating results and financial condition if we cannot offset these cost increases. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of inventory have and may continue to result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be able to pass on to its customers.  The price and availability of raw materials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, currency value fluctuations, inflation, as well as other factors. Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue to have increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases in production costs may result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. Due to the Company’s limited flexibility in price point, the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer, which could have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations and financial condition. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate new businesses into its existing business, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. 16 The Company’s long-term business strategy includes opportunistic growth through the development of new store concepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures and management attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipated amounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costs related to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our stores are not successful and that have resulted and could result in future impairment charges. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Risks Relating to Our Information Technology and Related Systems: A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.  We rely on our existing information technology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technology systems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems, including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets. Despite the precautions we take, our information systems are or may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerous events, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber-attacks, acts of war or terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control or that we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information technology systems, our failure to continue to upgrade or improve such systems, or the cost associated with maintaining, repairing or improving these systems, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current information technology systems may also disrupt our operations. A security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee, Company or customer information or a ransomware attack could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.  The protection of employee, Company and customer data is critical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programming error or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, including but not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiable information, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it to remediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt its operations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. The security of certain of this information also depends on the ability of third-party service providers, such as those we use to process credit and debit card payments as described below under “We are subject to payment-related risks,” to properly handle and protect such information. Our information systems and those of our third-party service providers are subject to ongoing and persistent cybersecurity threats from those seeking unauthorized access through means which are continually evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. Despite measures the Company takes to protect confidential information against unauthorized access or disclosure, which measures are ongoing and may continue to increase our costs, there is no assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of such information. If any such compromise or unauthorized access to or disclosure of this information were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the Company may be subject to ransomware attacks, which if successful could result in disruptions to the Company’s operations and expose it to remediation and other costs, risks of legal proceedings, damage the Company’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or transportation network could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 17 The distribution of our products is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through our network of third-party freight carriers. The merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by our third-party freight carriers. If the distribution center or our third-party freight carriers were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described above under “A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business,” our operations would likely be seriously disrupted. Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as well as any broader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center or deliver goods to our stores. As a result, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s failure to successfully operate its e-commerce websites or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impact customer satisfaction, our reputation and our business. Although the Company's e-commerce platform provides another channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers the online shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base, it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures in the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our websites, customer contact center or our distribution center, including system failures caused by telecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our present system capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error. Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security or data breaches involving the unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer information, as discussed above under “A security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee, Company or customer information or a ransomware attack could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.” We are also subject to risk related to delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such as shipping companies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdowns or adverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet the challenges of operating e-commerce websites or fulfilling customer expectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected. We are subject to payment-related risks. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including third-party credit cards, our own branded credit card, debit cards, gift cards and physical and electronic bank checks. For existing and future payment methods we offer to our customers, we are subject to fraud risk and to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increased costs and reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods). For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which have increased from time to time and may continue to increase over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. We rely on third-party service providers for payment processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these third-party service providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition, we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers and process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters: 18Changes to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.  In an effort to provide greater comparability of financial reporting in an increasing global environment, accounting regulatory authorities have been in discussions for many years regarding efforts to either converge U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), have U.S. companies provide supplemental IFRS-based information or continue to work toward a single set of globally accepted accounting standards. If implemented, these potential changes in accounting rules or regulations could significantly impact our future reported results of operations and financial position. Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have significantly affected our reported financial statements and those of other participants in the retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position or perceptions of our performance and financial condition. Continued scrutiny and changing expectations surrounding environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters from investors, customers, government regulators and other stakeholders may impose additional reporting requirements, additional costs and compliance risks. Public companies from across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from investors, customers, government regulators and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. In the U.S., there are various proposals for new or enhanced disclosure requirements regarding climate emissions, sustainability, workforce diversity and other human capital resources metrics, among other topics. Complying with these complex reporting obligations or expectations may increase our costs associated with compliance, disclosure and reporting. Furthermore, evolving ESG laws, regulations and stakeholder expectations may result in uncertain and potentially burdensome reporting requirements as stakeholders, agencies and government authorities adjust their expectations or change laws and regulations, such as proposals currently under consideration regarding climate emissions reporting and auditing requirements. Failure to comply with all of the currently proposed regulatory requirements in a timely manner may adversely affect our reputation, business and financial performance. If we fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’s Fashion Metro”, “Versona”, “Cache” and “Body Central” trademarks are integral to our store designs, brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty. Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and have also registered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to our business, we cannot give assurance that these registrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others. Infringement of our names, concepts, store designs or merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our image could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, we cannot give assurance that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subject to lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannot predict; however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our 19management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source our merchandise and operate our sourcing offices. Our business is also subject to regulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems for resolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisen and may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include, among other issues, intellectual property issues, employment issues, commercial disputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injury claims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, environmental laws, records and information management regulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting on the Company’s behalf may result in significant investigation costs, severe criminal or civil sanctions and reputational harm. These and other liabilities to which we may be subject could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significant management time. The Company may also be subject to regulatory review and audits, the results of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change from time to time. Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our operations and our reputation.  New legislation or regulation and interpretation of existing laws and regulations, including those related to data privacy, climate change or ESG matters could increase our costs of compliance, technology and business operations. The interpretation of existing or new laws to existing technology and business practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost. Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect our business and our financial condition. From time to time the Company is involved in litigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise from our normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, and could require significant management time. The Company’s periodic evaluation of litigation-related matters may change our assessment in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently known to us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We may also be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions or settlements of disputes may negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition. Maintaining and improving our internal control over financial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a public company may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controls may negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.  As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and related rule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have increased, and may continue to increase, our compliance costs and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the SEC’s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly and time-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot give assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial 20reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws and regulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we may become subject in the future, as a public company could have an adverse material impact on our business, our financial condition and the price of our common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these existing and new requirements could significantly increase our compliance costs. Risks Relating to Our Investments and Liquidity: We may experience market conditions or other events that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, our short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and our revolving line of credit.  Our short-term investments and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state, municipal and corporate debt securities. The value of those securities may be adversely impacted by factors relating to these securities, similar securities or the broader credit markets in general. Many of these factors are beyond our control, and include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings, rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality of market credit and liquidity, potential disruptions in the capital markets and changes in the underlying economic, financial and other conditions that drive these factors. As federal, state and municipal entities struggle with declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of our ability to timely access these investments if the market for these issues declines. Similarly, the default by issuers of the debt securities we hold or similar securities could impair the liquidity of our investments. The development or persistence of any of these conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits. An economic downturn or development of adverse conditions affecting the financial sector and stability of financial institutions could cause us to experience losses on our deposits.  Our ability to access credit markets and our revolving line of credit, either generally or on favorable market terms, may be impacted by the factors discussed in the preceding paragraph, as well as continued compliance with covenants under our revolving credit agreement. The development or persistence of any of these adverse factors or failure to comply with covenants on which our borrowing is conditioned may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to execute our business strategy. Risks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock: The interests of our principal shareholder may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company and otherwise affect our corporate governance and the market price of our common stock.  As of March 23, 2023, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned approximately 51.0% of the combined voting power of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Cato has the ability to substantially influence or determine the outcome of all matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and other business combinations or other significant Company transactions. Mr. Cato may have interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in a way with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to their interests. The concentration of voting power held by Mr. Cato could discourage potential investors from acquiring our common stock and could also have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change in control of the Company or other fundamental transaction, all of which could depress the market price of our common stock. In addition, Mr. Cato has the ability to control the management of the Company as a result of his position as Chief Executive Officer. We qualify for exemption as a “controlled company” from compliance with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance rules, including the requirements that we have a majority of independent directors on our Board, an 21independent compensation committee and an independent corporate governance and nominating committee. If we elected to utilize these “controlled company” exceptions, our other shareholders could lose the benefit of these corporate governance requirements and the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected. Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail apparel industry. As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters. Accordingly, our operating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularly relating to our industry, Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make its trading price more volatile.  The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as the following: low trading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; general conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the fashion and retail industry; conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securities analysts; negative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments; significant changes in our senior management team; and legal proceedings. Over the past several years the stock market in general, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Such fluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock"
9,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2022-03-23," Risk Factors
: An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report, including the disclosures under “Forward-looking Information” above in evaluating our Company and any potential investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur or persist, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and value of our common stock. Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic: The outbreak and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the Company's business, financial condition and operating results through fiscal 2021 and will likely continue to do so in fiscal 2022 and possibly beyond. Adverse financial impacts associated with the outbreak include, but are not limited to, (i) lower net sales in markets affected by actual or potential adverse changes in conditions relating to the pandemic, whether due to increases in case counts, state and local orders, reductions in store traffic and customer demand, labor shortages, or all of these factors, (ii) lower net sales caused by the delay of inventory production and fulfillment, (iii) and incremental costs associated with efforts to mitigate the effects of the outbreak, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses.  Though recent developments in the U.S. have led to the relaxation of many of the restrictions and mitigation measures that adversely affected the Company’s operations, store traffic, sales and results of operations since March 2020, there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the course of COVID-19 and its continuing effects on commercial behavior. These uncertainties include the potential emergence of additional variants, seasonal weather changes or other factors that may lead to a resurgence of the virus and a reinstitution of mandated restrictions, public health advisories or decreased willingness of customers, suppliers, associates and other constituencies on whom our business depends to engage in commercial activities. Other uncertainties include the extent to which and pace at which governments, businesses and individuals may adapt to COVID-19 as endemic and no longer a meaningful impediment or deterrent to commercial activity. The resurgence of the virus and its related effects on the global and U.S. economy, or the lingering uncertainties and time it may take to transition to wide acceptance of 11COVID-19 as endemic, will likely continue to materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.   While the Company currently anticipates that our results for fiscal 2022 and possibly beyond will likely be adversely impacted, whether and the extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s results will depend on the course of future developments, which are highly uncertain, including potential sporadic surges of the virus, the extent and pace of public acceptance of COVID-19 as endemic, the continuing evolution, acceptance and success of baseline mitigation measures such as vaccines, and possible new information, understanding or innovation that could alter the course and duration of current measures to combat the spread of the virus.  It is also possible COVID-19 and its continuing effects may result in longer term behavioral changes by customers and others that could adversely affect our business, including but not limited to a consumer shift to greater reliance on online versus in-person shopping, which could reduce traffic to our stores and more broadly to the strip shopping centers and malls in which most of our stores are located and disadvantage us relative to competitors who are better established in e-commerce sales, and reductions in face-to-face work, travel and socializing occasions, which may lead customers to less frequently desire or perceive the need to update their wardrobes.  The far-reaching impacts of COVID-19 may also intensify other risks we discuss in this report and other filings we make from time to time with the SEC.  Future outbreaks of disease or similar public health threats, or the fear of such an occurrence, may also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results. Risks Relating to Our Business: Increased product costs, freight costs, wage increases and operating costs due to inflation and other factors, as well as limitations in our ability to offset these cost increases by increasing the retail prices of our products or otherwise, may adversely affect our business, margins, results of operations and financial condition. The impact of inflation on the labor and raw materials used to make our products, coupled with the higher cost of ocean freight from Asia resulting from supply chain disruption, is continuing to increase the cost we pay for our products. Tight labor markets are causing wages to increase at the store, distribution center and home office levels, as well as making it more difficult to hire new associates and retain existing associates. The tight labor market and inflation also are driving up our operating costs. If we are unable to offset the effects of these increased costs to our business by increasing the retail prices of our products, reducing other expenses or otherwise, our business, margins, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our ability to raise retail prices in response to these cost increases may be limited, in part due to our customers’ unwillingness to pay higher prices for discretionary items in light of actual or perceived effects of inflation in increasing our customers’ cost of essential items and diminishing customers’ disposable income or financial outlook. Moreover, the persistence or worsening of inflationary conditions could also lead our customers to reduce their amount of current discretionary spending on our products even in the absence of price increases, which could erode our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Unusual weather, natural disasters, public health threats or similar events may adversely affect our sales or operations. 12 Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters, public health threats or similar events can influence customer trends and shopping habits. For example, heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions, including but not limited to winter weather over a prolonged period, might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions would adversely affect our business. The occurrence or threat of extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or other communicable diseases (such as COVID-19) or other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations, which could materially and adversely affect us. Because we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated with international operations and risks that affect the prevailing social, economic, political, public health and other conditions in the areas from which we source merchandise; changes, disruptions, increased costs or other problems affecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in Southeast Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remaining merchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreign sources. Further, our third-party vendors are dependent on materials primarily sourced from China. As a result, political unrest, labor disputes, terrorism, war, public health threats, including but not limited to communicable diseases (such as COVID-19), financial or other forms of instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting our supply chain, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or the imposition of, or changes in, laws, regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or governmental policies regarding these matters or other factors affecting the availability or cost of imports, could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. We are also subject to supply chain disruptions affecting ocean freight, including lack of overall ocean container shipping capacity versus the current demand for container shipping capacity, lack of our ability to access the ocean container capacity that we require, lack of equipment such as containers, port congestion, including increased dwell times for ocean container ships, and other conditions impacting ocean freight. We also are subject to domestic supply chain disruptions, including lack of domestic intermodal transportation (trucks and drivers), domestic port congestion, including increased dwell times for incoming container ships, lack of container yard capacity and lack of available drayage from the ports and other conditions that may impact our domestic supply chain. These supply chain risks may result in both higher costs to transport our merchandise and delayed merchandise arrivals to our stores, which may adversely affect our ability to sell this merchandise and increase markdowns of it. Our costs are also affected by currency fluctuations, and changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, increased energy and transportation costs have caused us significant cost increases from time to time, and future adverse changes in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise is transported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain, which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increased costs or potential disruptions impacting any port or trade route through which our products move, or we may be subject to increased costs and delays if forced to route freight through different ports than the ones through which our products typically move. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries or other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones we now sell. The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods on time and to the Company’s specification may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. 13 Our dependence on third-party vendors to manufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that our vendors will fail to perform as we expect. For example, the deterioration in any of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandise in a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to follow our vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, including compliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us to operational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks. If we are not able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the United States further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed below under “Risk Factors
 – Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters - Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned.  Our sales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centers and malls where we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop. In addition, our ability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space for and open new stores in attractive locations. Shopping centers and malls where we currently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adversely affected by, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularly affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores, changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shopping preferences, including but not limited to an increase in preference for online versus in-person shopping. To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shopping preferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores in desirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense. A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where we generally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centers and locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, could limit our ability to open new stores, adversely affect consumer traffic and reduce our sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs.  Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals and hire and train appropriate store personnel. In addition, our continued expansion into new regions of the country where we have not done business before may present new challenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these stores to perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could materially suffer.  Customer tastes and fashion trends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tend to change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty. Our success depends in part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond to changing fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our image with our customers. If we miscalculate either the market for our merchandise or our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations. 14Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may negatively impact our gross margin and our overall results of operations.  Comparable sales are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors affecting comparable sales include fashion trends, customer preferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather, supply chain issues, actual or potential public health threats and economic conditions. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of the applicable selling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we are not able to accurately predict customers’ preferences for our fashion items, we may have too much inventory, which may cause excessive markdowns. If we are unable to accurately predict demand for our merchandise, we may end up with inventory shortages, resulting in missed sales. A decrease in comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations. Existing and increased competition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and market share.  The women’s retail apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores and internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices. In some cases, our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significant market presence. In addition, our competitors also compete for the same retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experience pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to open new stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may present increased legal and operational risks.  In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. Our experience with legal and regulatory practices and requirements in Asia is limited. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandise production to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company’s specifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further, the activities conducted by our sourcing offices outside the United States subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, in particular below under “Risk Factors
 – Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters - Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.  Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing social, economic, political and public health conditions and uncertainties (such as matters under debate in the U.S. from time to time regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies and the impact of COVID-19), levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, the availability of consumer credit, inflation, consumer confidence and consumer perceptions of adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Any perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding them also generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, all of which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. In addition, 15numerous events, whether or not related to actual economic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or similar events, may also dampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of inventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be able to pass on to its customers.  Vendors are increasingly passing on higher production costs, including the costs to ship product, which may impact our ability to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of raw materials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, currency value fluctuations, inflation, as well as other factors. Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue to have increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases in production costs result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. Due to the Company’s limited flexibility in price point, the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer, which could have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations and financial condition. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate new businesses into its existing business, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.  The Company’s long-term business strategy includes opportunistic growth through the development of new store concepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures and management attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipated amounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costs related to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our stores are not successful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.  Like most retailers, we experience significant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and managers. Moreover, attracting and retaining skilled personnel has become increasingly challenging in the tight labor market that has persisted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. To offset this turnover as well as support new store growth, we must continually attract, hire and train new store associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in our store operating efficiency and productivity. We compete for qualified store associates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companies in our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financial resources than we do.  In addition, we depend on key management personnel to oversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of our existing business and future expansion. The success of executing our business strategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for key management personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.  If we are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract, train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 16 The currently competitive environment for hiring new associates and retaining existing associates is causing wages to increase, which could adversely affect our business, margins, operating results and financial condition if we cannot offset these cost increases. Risks Relating to Our Information Technology and Related Systems: A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.  We rely on our existing information technology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technology systems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems, including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets. Despite the precautions we take, our information systems are or may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerous events, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber-attacks, acts of war or terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control or that we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information technology systems, our failure to continue to upgrade or improve such systems, or the cost associated with maintaining, repairing or improving these systems, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current information technology systems may also disrupt our operations.  A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or transportation network could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.  The distribution of our products is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through our network of third-party freight carriers. The merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by our third-party freight carriers. If the distribution center or our third-party freight carriers were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described above under “A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business,” our operations would likely be seriously disrupted. Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as well as any broader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center or deliver goods to our stores. As a result, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.  The protection of employee, Company and customer data is critical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programming error or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, including but not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiable information, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it to remediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt its operations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. The security of certain of this information also depends on the ability of third-party service providers, such as those we use to process credit and debit card payments as described below under “We are subject to payment-related risks,” to properly handle and protect such information. Our information systems and those of our third-party service providers are subject to ongoing and persistent cybersecurity threats from those seeking unauthorized access through means which are continually evolving and may be difficult to 17anticipate or detect for long periods of time. Despite measures the Company takes to protect confidential information against unauthorized access or disclosure, which are ongoing and may continue to increase our costs, there is no assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of such information. If any such compromise or unauthorized access to or disclosure of this information were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. We are subject to payment -related risks. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including third-party credit cards, our own branded credit card, debit cards, gift cards and physical and electronic bank checks. For existing and future payment methods we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increased costs and reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods), as well as fraud risk. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. We rely on third-party service providers for payment processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these third-party service providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition, we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers and process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. The Company’s failure to successfully operate its e-commerce websites or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impact customer satisfaction, our reputation and our business. Although the Company's e-commerce platform provides another channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers the on-line shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base, it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures in the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our websites, customer contact center or our distribution center, including system failures caused by telecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our present system capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error. Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security or data breaches involving the unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer information, as discussed above under “A security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.” We are also subject to risk related to delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such as shipping companies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdowns or adverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet the challenges of operating e-commerce websites or fulfilling customer expectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected. Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters: Changes to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.  In an effort to provide greater comparability of financial reporting in an increasing global environment, accounting regulatory authorities have been in discussions for many years regarding efforts to either converge U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting 18Standards (“IFRS”), have U.S. companies provide supplemental IFRS-based information or continue to work toward a single set of globally accepted accounting standards. If implemented, these potential changes in accounting rules or regulations could significantly impact our future reported results of operations and financial position. Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have significantly affected our reported financial statements and those of other participants in the retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position or perceptions of our performance and financial condition. Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect our business and our financial condition. From time to time the Company is involved in litigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise from our normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, and could require significant management time. The Company’s periodic evaluation of litigation-related matters may change our assessment in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently known to us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We may also be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions or settlements of disputes may negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition. Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source our merchandise and operate our sourcing offices. Our business is also subject to regulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems for resolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisen and may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include, among other issues, intellectual property issues, employment issues, commercial disputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injury claims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, environmental laws, records and information management regulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting on the Company’s behalf may result in significant investigation costs, severe criminal or civil sanctions and reputational harm. These and other liabilities to which we may be subject could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significant management time. The Company may also be subject to regulatory review and audits, which results may have the potential to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change from time to time. Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our operations and our reputation.  New legislation or regulation and interpretation of existing laws and regulations, including those related to data privacy, could increase our costs of compliance, technology and business operations. The interpretation of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost. If we fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 19 We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’s Fashion Metro” and “Versona” trademarks are integral to our store designs, brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty. Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and have also registered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to our business, we cannot give assurance that these registrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others. Infringement of our names, concepts, store designs or merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our image could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, we cannot give assurance that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subject to lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannot predict; however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Maintaining and improving our internal control over financial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a public company may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controls may negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.  As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and related rule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have increased, and may continue to increase, our compliance costs and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the SEC’s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly and time-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot give assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws and regulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we may become subject in the future, as a public company could have an adverse material impact on our business, our financial condition and the price of our common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these existing and new requirements could significantly increase our compliance costs. Risks Relating to Our Investments and Liquidity: We may experience market conditions or other events that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, our short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and our revolving line of credit.  Our short-term investments and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state, municipal and corporate debt securities. The value of those securities may be adversely impacted by factors relating to these securities, similar securities or the broader credit markets in general. Many of these factors are beyond our control, and include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings, rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality of market credit and liquidity, potential disruptions in the capital markets and changes in the underlying economic, financial and other conditions that drive these factors. As federal, state and municipal entities struggle with declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of our ability to timely access these investments if the market for 20these issues declines. Similarly, the default by issuers of the debt securities we hold or similar securities could impair the liquidity of our investments. The development or persistence of any of these conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits. An economic downturn or development of adverse conditions affecting the financial sector and stability of financial institutions could cause us to experience losses on our deposits.  Our ability to access credit markets and our revolving line of credit, either generally or on favorable market terms, may be impacted by the factors discussed in the preceding paragraph, as well as continued compliance with covenants under our revolving credit agreement. The development or persistence of any of these adverse factors or failure to comply with covenants on which our borrowing is conditioned may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to execute our business strategy. Risks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock: Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the  market price of our common stock.  Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail apparel industry. As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters. Accordingly, our operating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of our principal shareholder may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company and otherwise affect our corporate governance and the market price of our common stock.  As of March 23, 2022, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned approximately 49.8% of the combined voting power of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Cato has the ability to substantially influence or determine the outcome of all matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and other business combinations or other significant Company transactions. Mr. Cato may have interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in a way with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to their interests. The concentration of voting power held by Mr. Cato could discourage potential investors from acquiring our common stock and could also have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change in control of the Company or other fundamental transaction, all of which could depress the market price of our common stock. In addition, Mr. Cato has the ability to control the management of the Company as a result of his position as Chief Executive Officer. If Mr. Cato acquires beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the combined voting power of our common stock (including as a result of continued Company stock repurchases from time to time under our stock repurchase program that would reduce our outstanding shares), we would qualify for exemption as a “controlled company” from compliance with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance rules, including the requirements that we have a majority of independent directors on our Board, an independent compensation committee and an independent corporate governance and nominating committee. If we became eligible and elected to utilize these “controlled company” exceptions, our other shareholders could lose the benefit of these corporate governance requirements and the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected. Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularly relating to our industry, Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make its trading price 21more volatile.  The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as the following: low trading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; general conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the fashion and retail industry; conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securities analysts; negative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments; significant changes in our senior management team; and legal proceedings. Over the past several years the stock market in general, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Such fluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  "
4,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2021-03-29," Risk Factors
:   An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report, including the disclosures under “Forward-looking Information” above in evaluating our Company and any potential investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur or persist, our business, financial condition and ope rating results could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition.  Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic:  The outbreak and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic has and will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   The COVID -19 pandemic has adversely impacted the Company's business, financial condition and operating results through fiscal 2020, and we expect that it will continue to do so in fiscal 2021 and possibly beyond. Adverse financial impacts associated with the outbreak include, but are not limited to, (i) lower net sales in markets affected by the actual or potential outbreak, whether due to state and local orders to close stores, reductions in store traffic and customer demand, labor shortages, or all of these factors,  (ii)  lower  net  sales  caused by  the  delay  of  inventory  production  and  fulfillment, (iii)  and incremental costs associated with efforts to mitigate the effects of the outbreak, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses.   The COVID -19 pandemic has caused state and local governments to issue orders mandating store closures and other measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. In addition, public health officials have issued precautions and guidance intended to reduce the spread of the virus, including particular cautions about congregating in large groups or heavily populated areas, such as malls and shopping centers. We temporarily closed all Cato, It’s Fashion, It’s Fashion Metro and Versona stores on March 19, 2020. Beginning on May 1, 2020, we began to re-open stores based on the pertinent state and local orders. As of June 15, 2020, all stores were re-opened, but our stores have been and continue to operate at reduced hours. Periodic increases in infection rates in communities where our stores  are located may  prompt further governmental measures or public health guidance to reduce public activity and gatherings in order to mitigate the spread of the virus, and may also continue to adversely affect consumer confidence. There continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the breadth , severity and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the global and U.S. economy, consumer willingness to visit malls and shopping centers, and its impact on appropriate associate staffing levels for our stores. The status and effects of national, state or local action, initiatives, legislation, guidelines or programs that attempt to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 or address its economic effects on our customers, suppliers or the Company also remain fluid.   While the Company currently anticipates that our results for fiscal 2021 and possibly beyond will be adversely impacted, the extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s results will depend on the course of future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the relative speed and success of, as well as public confidence in, mitigation measures such as the current effort to vaccinate substantial   11 portions of the U.S. and global population, emerging information regarding variants of the virus or new viruses  and  their potential  impact  on current  mitigation  efforts, public  attitudes  toward continued compliance with containment and mitigation measures, and possible new information and understanding that could alter the course and duration of current measures to combat the spread of the virus.   It  is  also  possible the  COVID-19  pandemic  may result  in  longer  term behavioral  changes  by customers and others that could adversely affect our business, including but not limited to a consumer shift to greater reliance on online versus in-person shopping, which could reduce traffic to our stores and more broadly to the strip shopping centers and malls in which most of our stores are located and disadvantage us relative to competitors who are better established in e-commerce sales, and reductions in face-to-face work, travel and socializing occasions, which may lead customers to less frequently desire or perceive the need to update their wardrobes.   The far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may also intensify other risks we discuss in this report and other filings we make from time to time with the SEC.   Future outbreaks of disease or similar public health threats, or the fear of such an occurrence, may also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.  Risks Relating to Our Business:  Unusual weather, natural disasters, public health threats or similar events may adversely affect our sales or operations.   Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters, public health threats or similar events can influence customer trends and shopping habits. For example, heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions , including but not limited to winter weather over a prolonged period, might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions would adversely affect our business. The occurrence or threat of extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or other communicable diseases (such as the global COVID-19 pandemic) or other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations, which could materially and adversely affect us.  Because we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated with international operations and risks that affect the prevailing social, economic, political, public health and other conditions in the areas from which we source merchandise; changes, disruptions, cost changes or other problems affecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.   A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in Southeast Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remaining merchandise from domestic vendors  who  acquire the  merchandise  from foreign  sources.  Further, our  third-party  vendors are dependent on materials primarily sourced from China. As a result, political unrest, labor disputes, terrorism, public health threats, including but not limited to communicable diseases (such as the global COVID-19 pandemic), financial or other forms of instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade  from countries  affecting our  supply chain,  increased security  requirements for  imported merchandise, or the imposition of, or changes in, laws, regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or governmental policies regarding these matters or other factors affecting the availability or cost of imports, could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. We are also subject to supply chain disruptions affecting ocean freight, including lack of ocean   12 container ship capacity, lack of equipment such as containers, port congestion and other conditions impacting ocean freight. We also are subject to domestic supply chain disruptions, including lack of domestic intermodal transportation (trucks and drivers), domestic port congestion and other conditions that ma y impact domestic supply chain. These supply chain risks may result in both higher costs to transport our merchandise and delayed merchandise arrivals to our stores, which may adversely affect our ability to sell this merchandise and increase markdowns of it. Our costs are also affected by currency fluctuations, and changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In  addition,  increased  energy  and  transportation costs  have  caused  us  significant cost increases from time to time, and future adverse changes in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise is transported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increased costs or potential disruptions impacting any port or trade route through which our products move or we may be subject to increased costs and delays if forced to route freight through different ports than the ones through which our products typically move. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries or other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones we now sell.  The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods on time and to the Company’s specification may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.   Our dependence on third- party vendors to manufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that our vendors will fail to perform as we expect. For example, the deterioration in any of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandise in a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to follow our vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, including compliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us to operational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks. If we are not able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the United States further subject us to numerous  U.S.  and  international  regulations  and  compliance  risks,  as discussed below  under  “Risk Factors
 – Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters - Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”  Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned.   Our sales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centers and malls where we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop. In addition, our ability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space for and open new stores in attractive locations. Shopping centers and malls where we currently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adversely affected by, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularly affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores, changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shopping preferences, including but not limited to an increase in preference for online versus in-person shopping. To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shopping preferences of our consumers, we  need  to  maintain  and  acquire  stores  in  desirable  locations  where competition for  suitable  store locations is intense. A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where we generally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centers and locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, could limit our ability to open new stores, adversely affect consumer traffic and reduce our sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs.    13  Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals and hire and train appropriate store personnel. In addition, our continued expansion into new regions of the country where we  have not  done business  before may  present new  challenges in  competition,  distribution and merchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these stores to perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could materially suffer.   Customer tastes and fashion trends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tend to change rapidly  and  cannot  be  predicted with  certainty. Our  success  depends  in  part upon  our  ability  to consistently anticipate, design and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond to changing fashion trends could adversely affect c onsumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our image with our customers. If we miscalculate either the market for our merchandise or our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations.  Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may negatively impact our gross margin and our overall results of operations.   Comparable sales are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors affecting comparable sales include fashion trends, customer preferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather, actual or potential public health threats and economic conditions. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of the applicable selling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we are not able to accurately predict customers’ preferences for our fashion items, we may have too much inventory, which may cause excessive markdowns. If we are unable to accurately predict demand for our merchandise,  we  may end  up  with inventory  shortages, resulting  in  missed sales.  A  decrease in comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations.  Existing and increased competition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and market share.   The women’s retail apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers, department stores, off -price retailers, specialty stores and internet- based retailers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices. In some cases, our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significant market presence. In addition, our competitors  also compete for the same  retail  store  space.  As  a  result  of  this competition,  we  may experience pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to open new stores, as well  as  loss  of  market  share,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect our  business,  results  of operations and financial condition.  The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may present increased legal and operational risks.   In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. Our experience with legal and regulatory practices and requirements in Asia is limited. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandise production to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company’s specifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further, the activities conducted by our sourcing offices outside the   14 United States subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors
” section, in particular below under “Risk Factors
 – Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters - Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”  Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.   Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing social, economic, political and public health conditions and uncertainties (such as matters under debate in the U.S. from time to time regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies and the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic), levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptions of adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Any perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding them also generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, all of which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. In addition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual economic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or similar events, may also dampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of inventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be able to pass on to its customers.   Vendors are  increasingly  passing  on  higher production  costs,  which  may  impact our  ability  to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of raw materials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, currency value fluctuations, as well as other factors. Additionally, manufacturers  have and  may continue  to have  increases in  other manufacturing  costs, such  as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases in production costs result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. Due to the Company’s limited flexibility in price point, the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  If the Company is unable to successfully integrate new businesses into its existing business, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.   The Company’s long-term business strategy includes opportunistic growth through the development of  new  store concepts.  This  growth  may require  significant  capital  expenditures and  management attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipated amounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costs related to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our stores are not successful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.  Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.    15  Like most retailers, we experience significant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and managers. Because our continued store growth will require the hiring and training of new associates, we must continually attract, hire and train new store associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in our store operating efficiency and productivity. We compete for qualified store associates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companies in our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financial resources than we do.   In addition, we depend on key management personnel to oversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of our existing business and future expansion. The success of executing our business strategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for key management personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.   If we are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract, train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Risks Relating to Our Information Technology and Related Systems:  A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.   We  rely on  our  existing  information  technology  systems  for  merchandise  operations, including merchandise planning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technology systems for our distribution processes,  as  well as  our  financial systems,  including  accounts payable,  general  ledger, accounts receivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets. Despite the precautions we take, our information systems are or may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerous events, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber-attacks, acts of war or terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control or that we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information technology systems, our failure to continue to upgrade or improve such systems, or the cost associated with maintaining, repairing or improving  these  systems, could  adversely  affect our  business,  results of  operations  and financial condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current information technology systems may also disrupt our operations.  A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or transportation network could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.   The distribution of our products is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through our network of third-party freight carriers. The merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by our third-party freight carriers. If the distribution center or our third-party freight carriers were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described above under “A failure or disruption relating to our information technology  systems  could  adversely  affect our  business,”  our  operations  would  likely be  seriously disrupted. Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as well as any broader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center or deliver goods to our stores. As a result, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.    16 A security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.   The protection of employee, Company and customer data is critical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programming error or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, including but not limited  to  credit  card  data  or other  personally  identifiable  information,  could  severely  damage  the Company's reputation, expose it to remediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt its  operations  and  otherwise  adversely  affect the  Company's  business  and  financial condition.  The security of certain of this information also depends on the ability of third-party service providers, such as those we use to process credit and debit card payments as described below under “We are subject to payment-related risks,” to properly handle and protect such information. Our information systems and those of our third-party service providers are subject to ongoing and persistent cybersecurity threats from those seeking unauthorized access through means which are continually evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. Despite measures the Company takes to protect confidential information against unauthorized access or disclosure, which are ongoing and may continue to increase our costs, there is no assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of such information. If any such compromise or unauthorized access to or disclosure of this information were to occur, it could have  a  material adverse  effect  on the  Company's  reputation, business,  operating  results, financial condition and cash flows.  We are subject to payment -related risks.    We accept payments using a variety of methods, including third-party credit cards, our own branded credit cards, debit cards, gift cards and physical and electronic bank checks. For existing and future payment methods we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increased costs and reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debi t cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. We rely on third-party service providers for payment processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these third-party service providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or com promised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition, we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers and process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  The Company’s failure to successfully operate its e-commerce websites or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impact customer satisfaction, our reputation and our business.    Although the Company's e-commerce platform provides another channel to drive incremental sales, provide  existing  customers  the  on- line  shopping  experience  and introduce  the  Company  to  a new customer base, it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures in the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our websites, customer contact center or our distribution center, including system failures caused by telecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our present system capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error. Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security or data breaches involving the unauthorized access to or  disclosure  of  customer  information,  as  discussed above  under “A security  breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect our costs,   17 reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.” We are also subject to risk related to delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such as shipping companies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdowns or adverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet the challenges of operating e-commerce websites or fulfilling customer expectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected.  Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters:  Changes to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.   In  an effort  to provide  greater comparability  of financial  reporting in  an increasing  global environment, accounting regulatory authorities have been in discussions for many years regarding efforts to either converge U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), have U.S. companies provide supplemental IFRS-based information or continue to work toward a single set of globally accepted accounting standards. If implemented, these potential changes  in  accounting  rules  or  regulations could significantly  impact  our  future reported results  of operations and financial position. Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have significantly affected our reported financial statements and those of other participants in the retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future.   For example, changes to lease accounting standards effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019 required the Company to capitalize operating leases in its financial statements. These changes required us to record a significant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, resulting in an increase of 40% to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, and required us to make other changes to the recording and classification of lease-related expenses on our statements of income and cash flows. These changes could lead to the perception by investors that we are highly leveraged and also change the calculation of numerous financial metrics and measures of our performance and financial condition. These and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely  affect our  reported results  of operations  and financial  position or  perceptions of  our performance and financial condition.  Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect our business and our financial condition.    From time to time the Company is involved in litigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise from our normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, and could require significant  management  time.  The  Company’s  periodic  evaluation  of litigation- related matters may change our assessment in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently known to us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We may also be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions or settlements of disputes may negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition.  Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.   Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source our merchandise and operate our sourcing offices. Our business is also subject to regulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems for resolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisen and may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include, among other issues, intellectual property  issues, employment  issues, commercial  disputes, product-oriented  matters,  tax, customer   18 relations and personal injury claims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements, import and export  license requirements,  privacy and  data protection  laws, environmental  laws, records  and information management regulations, tariffs and taxes and anti- corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting on the Company’s behalf may result in significant investigation costs, severe criminal or civil sanctions and reputational harm. These and other liabilities to which we may be subject could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significant management time. The Company may also be subject to regulatory review and audits, which results may have the potential to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change from time to time. Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our operations and our reputation.   New legislation or regulation and interpretation of existing laws and regulations related to data privacy could increase our costs of compliance, technology and business operations. The interpretation of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost.  If we fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.   We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’s Fashion Metro” and “Versona” trademarks are integral to our store designs, brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty. Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and have also registered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to our business, we cannot give assurance that these registrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our other  intellectual  property  rights  by others.  Infringement  of  our  names, concepts,  store  designs  or merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation  of  our image  could  adversely affect  our business,  financial  condition and  results  of operations.   In addition, we cannot give assurance that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subject to lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannot predict; however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Maintaining and improving our internal control over financial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a public company may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controls may negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.   As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes -Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and related rule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have increased, and may continue to increase, our compliance costs and place significant strain on our pe rsonnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the SEC’s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over   19 financial reporting, which is a costly and time-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot give assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws and regulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we may become subject in the future,  as  a  public company could  have  an  adverse  material impact on  our  business,  our  financial condition and the price of our common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these existing and new requirements could significantly increase our compliance costs.  Risks Relating to Our Investments and Liquidity:  We may experience market conditions or other events that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, our short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and our revolving line of credit.   Our short -term investments and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state, municipal and corporate debt securities. The value of those securities may be adversely impacted by factors relating to these securities, similar securities or the broader credit markets in general. Many of these factors are beyond our control, and include but are not limited to changes to credit ratings, rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality of market credit and liquidity, potential disruptions in the capital markets and changes in the underlying economic, financial and other conditions that drive these factors. As federal, state and municipal entities struggle with declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of our ability to timely access these investments if the market for these issues declines. Similarly, the default by issuers of the debt securities we hold or similar securities could impair the liquidity of our investments. The development or persistence of any of these conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits. An economic downturn or development of adverse conditions affecting the financial sector and stability of financial institutions could cause us to experience losses on our deposits.   Our ability to access credit markets and our revolving line of credit, either generally or on favorable market terms, may be impacted by the factors discussed in the preceding paragraph, as well as continued compliance with covenants under our revolving credit agreement. The development or persistence of any of these adverse factors or failure to comply with covenants on which our borrowing is conditioned may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation s and our ability to execute our business strategy.  Risks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock:   Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the  market price of our common stock.   Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail apparel industry. As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters. Accordingly, our operating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations could adversely affect the marke t price of our common stock.  The interests of a principal shareholder may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company and otherwise affect our corporate governance.   As of March 29, 2021, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially   20 controlled approximately 48.1% of the voting power of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantly influence substantially all matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and other business combinations or other significant  Company transactions.  Mr. Cato  may have  interests that  differ from  those of  other shareholders, and may vote in a way with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to their interests. In addition, the concentration of voting power held by Mr. Cato could have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change in c ontrol of the Company, which could depress the market price of our common stock. In the future, if Mr. Cato acquires beneficial control of more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock (including as a result of continued Company stock repurchases from time to time under our stock repurchase program that would reduce our outstanding shares), we would qualify for exemption as a “controlled company” from compliance with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance rules, including the requirements that we have a majority of independent directors  on our  Board, an  independent compensation  committee and  an independent  corporate governance and nominating committee. If we became eligible and elected to utilize these “controlled company”  exceptions,  our  other  shareholders  could  lose the  benefit  of  these  corporate  governance requirements and the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.  Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularly relating to our industry, Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make its trading price more volatile.   The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as the following: low trading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; general conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the fashion and retail industry; conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securities analysts; n egative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding short -selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments; significant changes in our senior management team; and legal proceedings. Over the past several years the stock market in general, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers in particular, have  experienced extreme  price fluctuations  that have  at times  been unrelated  to the  operating performance of those companies. Such fluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  "
11,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2020-03-27,"Risk Factors
:  An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report, including the disclosures under “Forward-looking Information” above in evaluating our Company and any potential investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur or persist, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition. Risks Relating To Our Business: An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, or fear of such an event, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.  An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat (including the global coronavirus outbreak), or fear of such an event, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and operating results. Potential financial impacts associated with the actual or feared occurrence of such an event include, but are not limited to, (i) lower net sales in markets affected by the actual or potential outbreak, whether due to reductions in store traffic and customer demand, labor shortages, or both, (ii) lower net sales caused by the delay of inventory production and fulfillment, (iii) and potential incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of such an actual or potential event, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses.   The spread of COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend, and in some cases mandate, precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as malls and shopping centers. We temporarily closed all Cato, Its Fashion, Its Fashion Metro and Versona stores for an expected period of two weeks beginning March 19, 2020. There is significant uncertainty around the duration, breadth and severity of these store closures and other business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the global and U.S. economy, consumer willingness to visit malls and shopping centers, and appropriate associate staffing levels for our stores once they re-open. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact. We are also unable to predict the outcome or effect of national, state or local legislation that attempts to address the economic effects of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers or the Company.   We currently believe our first quarter results of operations will be negatively impacted by these developments. Given the many uncertainties and far reaching consequences of potential developments, we cannot assure that the COVID-19 outbreak and the many related impacts will not require extended or additional store closures and other disruptions to our business or will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and beyond.9   Unusual weather, natural disasters, public health threats or similar events may adversely affect our sales or operations.  Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters, public health threats or similar events can influence customer trends and shopping habits. For example, heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions would adversely affect our business. The occurrence or threat of extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or other communicable diseases (such as the global coronavirus) or other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations, which could materially and adversely affect us. Because we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated with international operations and risks that affect the prevailing social, economic, political, public health and other conditions in the areas from which we source merchandise; changes, disruptions, cost changes or other problems affecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in East Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remaining merchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreign sources. Further, our third-party vendors are dependent on materials primarily sourced from China. As a result, political unrest, labor disputes, terrorism, public health threats, including but not limited to communicable diseases (such as the global coronavirus), financial or other forms of instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting our supply chain, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or the imposition of, or changes in, laws, regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or governmental policies regarding these matters or other factors affecting the availability or cost of imports, could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. Our costs are also affected by currency fluctuations, and changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, increased energy and transportation costs have caused us significant cost increases from time to time, and future adverse changes in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise is transported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increased costs or potential disruptions impacting any port or trade route through which our products move or we may be subject to increased costs and delays if forced to route freight through different ports than the ones through which our products typically move. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries or other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones we now sell. The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods on time and to the Company’s specification may adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our dependence on third-party vendors to manufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that our vendors will fail to perform as we expect. For example, the deterioration in any of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandise in a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to follow our vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, including compliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us to operational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks. If we are not able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely10  affected. Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the United States further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed below under “Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned.  Our sales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centers where we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop. In addition, our ability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space for and open new stores in attractive locations. Shopping Centers where we currently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adversely affected by, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularly affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores, changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shopping preferences. To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shopping preferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores in desirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense. A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where we generally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centers and locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, limiting our ability to open new stores, could adversely affect consumer traffic and reduce our sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs.  Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals and hire and train appropriate store personnel. In addition, our continued expansion into new regions of the country where we have not done business before may present new challenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these stores to perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could materially suffer.   Customer tastes and fashion trends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tend to change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty. Our success depends in part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond to changing fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our image with our customers. If we miscalculate either the market for our merchandise or our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations. Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may negatively impact our gross margin and our overall results of operations.  Comparable sales are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors affecting comparable sales include fashion trends, customer preferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather, actual or potential public health threats and economic conditions. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of the applicable selling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we are not able to accurately predict customers’ preferences for our fashion items, we may have too much inventory, which may cause excessive markdowns. If we are unable to accurately predict demand for our11  merchandise, we may end up with inventory shortages, resulting in missed sales. A decrease in comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations. Existing and increased competition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and market share.  The women’s retail apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores and internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices. In some cases, our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significant market presence. In addition, our competitors also compete for the same retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experience pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to open new stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may present increased legal and operational risks.  In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. Our experience with legal and regulatory practices and requirements in Asia is limited. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandise production to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company’s specifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further, the activities conducted by our sourcing offices outside the United States subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors
” section, in particular below under “Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.  Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing social, economic, political and public health conditions and uncertainties (such as matters under debate in the U.S. from time to time regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies, the potential outcome of 2020 political elections in the U.S. and the impact of the global coronavirus outbreak), levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptions of adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Any perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding them also generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, all of which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations. In addition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual economic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or similar events, may also dampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of inventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be able to pass on to its customers. 12   Vendors are increasingly passing on higher production costs, which may impact our ability to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of raw materials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, currency value fluctuations, as well as other factors. Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue to have increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases in production costs result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. Due to the Company’s limited flexibility in price point, the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.  We rely on our existing information technology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technology systems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems, including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets. Despite the precautions we take, our information systems may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerous events, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber-attacks, acts of war or terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control or that we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information technology systems, our failure to continue to upgrade or improve such systems, or the cost associated with maintaining, repairing or improving these systems, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current information technology systems may also disrupt our operations.  A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or transportation network could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.  The distribution of our products is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through our network of third-party freight carriers. The merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by our third-party freight carriers. If the distribution center or our third-party freight carriers were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described under “A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business,” our operations would likely be seriously disrupted. Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as well as any broader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center or deliver goods to our stores. As a result, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.  In an effort to provide greater comparability of financial reporting in an increasing global environment, accounting regulatory authorities have been in discussions for many years regarding efforts to either converge U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), have U.S. companies provide supplemental IFRS-based information or continue to work toward a single set of globally accepted accounting standards. If implemented, these potential changes in accounting rules or regulations could significantly impact our future reported results of operations and financial position. Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have significantly affected our reported financial statements and those of other participants in the retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future. 13    For example, changes to lease accounting standards effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019 required the Company to capitalize operating leases in its financial statements. These changes required us to record a significant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, resulting in an increase of 40% to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, and required us to make other changes to the recording and classification of lease-related expenses on our statements of income and cash flows. These changes could lead to the perception by investors that we are highly leveraged and also change the calculation of numerous financial metrics and measures of our performance and financial condition. These and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position or perceptions of our performance and financial condition. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate new businesses into its existing business, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.  The Company’s long-term business strategy includes opportunistic growth through the development of new store concepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures and management attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipated amounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costs related to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our stores are not successful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.  A security breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.   The protection of employee, Company and customer data is critical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programming error or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, including but not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiable information, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it to remediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt its operations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. Despite measures the Company takes to protect confidential information, which are ongoing and may continue to increase our costs, there is no assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of such information. The security of certain of this information also depends on the ability of third-party service providers, such as those we use to process credit and debit card payments as described below under “We are subject to payment-related risks,” to properly handle and protect such information. If any such compromise or unauthorized disclosure of this information were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. We are subject to payment-related risks.   We accept payments using a variety of methods, including third-party credit cards, our own branded credit cards, debit cards, gift cards and physical bank checks. For existing and future payment methods we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increased costs and reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. We rely on third-party service providers for payment processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these third-party service providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to14  make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition, we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers and process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. The Company’s failure to successfully operate its e-commerce websites or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impact customer satisfaction, our reputation and our business. Although the Company's e-commerce platform provides another channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers the on-line shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base, it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures in the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our websites, customer contact center or our distribution center, including system failures caused by telecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our present system capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error. Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security or data breaches involving the unauthorized disclosure of customer information, as discussed above under “A security breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.” We are also subject to risk related to delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such as shipping companies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdowns or adverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet the challenges of operating e-commerce websites or fulfilling customer expectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected. Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect our business and our financial condition. From time to time the Company is involved in litigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise from our normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, and could require significant management time. The Company’s periodic evaluation of litigation-related matters may change our assessment in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently known to us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We may also be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions or settlements of disputes may negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition. Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.  Like most retailers, we experience significant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and managers. Because our continued store growth will require the hiring and training of new associates, we must continually attract, hire and train new store associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in our store operating efficiency and productivity. We compete for qualified store associates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companies in our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financial resources than we do.  In addition, we depend on key management personnel to oversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of our existing business and future expansion. The success of executing our business strategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for key management personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow. 15   If we are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract, train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source our merchandise and operate our sourcing offices. Our business is also subject to regulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems for resolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisen and may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include, among other issues, intellectual property issues, employment issues, commercial disputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injury claims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, environmental laws, records and information management regulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting on the Company’s behalf may result in significant investigation costs, severe criminal or civil sanctions and reputational harm. These and other liabilities to which we may be subject could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significant management time. The Company may also be subject to regulatory review and audits, which results may have the potential to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change from time to time. Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our operations and our reputation.  New legislation or regulation and interpretation of existing laws and regulations related to data privacy could increase our costs of compliance, technology and business operations. The interpretation of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost. If we fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’s Fashion Metro” and “Versona” trademarks are integral to our store designs, brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty. Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and have also registered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to our business, we cannot assure that these registrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others. Infringement of our names, concepts, store designs or merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our image could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, we cannot assure that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subject to lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of16  which we cannot predict; however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may experience market conditions that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, our short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.  Our short-term investments and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state, municipal and corporate debt securities. The value of those securities may be impacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes to credit ratings, rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality of market credit and liquidity, and changes in the underlying economic, financial and other conditions that drive these factors. As federal, state and municipal entities struggle with declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of our ability to timely access these investments if the market for these issues declines. Similarly, the default by issuers could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits. An economic downturn or development of adverse conditions affecting the financial sector and stability of financial institutions could cause us to experience losses on our deposits.  Our ability to access credit markets and our revolving line of credit may be impacted by factors beyond our control such as changes in credit rating and collateral, as well as potential disruptions in the Capital markets. This may adversely affect our results of operation and our ability to execute our business strategy. Similarly, our ability to access credit markets at favorable terms could be adversely impacted due to changes in credit ratings, collateral and potential disruptions in the Capital markets. This may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to execute our business strategy. Maintaining and improving our internal control over financial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a public company may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controls may negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.  As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and related rule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have, and may continue to, increase our compliance costs and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the SEC’s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly and time-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot give assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws and regulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we may become subject in the future, as a public company could have an adverse material impact on our business, our financial condition and the price of our common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these requirements, particularly with new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act that have yet to be implemented, could significantly increase our compliance costs. Risks Relating To The Market Value Of Our Common Stock: Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 17   Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail apparel industry. As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters. Accordingly, our operating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of a principal shareholder may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company.  As of March 27, 2020, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially controlled approximately 46.1% of the voting power of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantly influence substantially all matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and other business combinations or other significant Company transactions. Mr. Cato may have interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in a way with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to their interests. In addition, the concentration of voting power held by Mr. Cato could have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change in control of the Company, which could depress the market price of our common stock. Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularly relating to our industry, Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make its trading price more volatile.  The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors may cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as the following: low trading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; general conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the fashion and retail industry; conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securities analysts; negative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments; significant changes in our senior management team; and legal proceedings. Over the past several years the stock market in general, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Such fluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. "
12,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2019-03-27,">Item 1A.     RiskFactors:      An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks.  You shouldcarefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the otherinformation contained in this report, including the disclosures under“Forward-looking Information” above in evaluating our Company and any potentialinvestment in our common stock.  If any of the following risks or uncertaintiesoccur, our business, financial condition and operating results could bematerially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock coulddecline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our commonstock.  The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the onlyones facing us.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to usor that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affectour business operating results and financial condition. Risks Relating To Our Business: If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond torapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, ourbusiness and results of operations could materially suffer.       Customertastes and fashion trends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tendto change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty.  Our success dependsin part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond tochanging merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond tochanging fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of ourmerchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and our image with our customers.  If we miscalculate either themarket for our merchandise or our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, wemay be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory atbelow-average markups over cost, or below cost, which would adversely affectour margins and results of operations. Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability toeffectively manage inventory may negatively impact our gross margin and ouroverall results of operations. Comparable sales are expected to continue to fluctuate inthe future. Factors affecting comparable sales include fashion trends, customerpreferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather and economicconditions. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of the applicableselling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we are not able toaccurately predict customers’ preferences for our fashion items, we may havetoo much inventory which may cause excessive markdowns. If we are unable toaccurately predict demand for our merchandise, we may end up with inventoryshortages resulting in missed sales. A decrease in comparable sales or ourinability to effectively manage inventory may adverselyaffect our gross margin and results of operations.9       Existingand increased competition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negativelyimpact our business,              results of operations, financial conditionand market share.      The women’s retail apparel industryis highly competitive.  We compete primarily with discount stores,mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty storesand internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greaterfinancial, marketing and other resources than we have.  Many of ourcompetitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices.  In somecases our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significantmarket presence.  In addition, our competitors also compete for thesame retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experiencepricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to opennew stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially andadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Because we source a significant portion of our merchandisedirectly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated withinternational operations; changes, disruptions, cost changes or other problemsaffecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain could materially and adverselyaffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.       Asignificant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in East Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remainingmerchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreignsources.  As a result, political unrest, labor disputes, terrorism, financialor other forms of instability or other events resulting in the disruption oftrade from countries affecting our supply chain, increased securityrequirements for imported merchandise, or the imposition of, or changes in,laws, regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or governmental policiesregarding these matters or other factors affecting the availability or cost ofimports, could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of ourmerchandise or increase our costs. Our costs are also affected by currencyfluctuations, and changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreigncurrencies may increase our cost of goods sold. Any of these factors could havea material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Inaddition, increased energy and transportation costs have caused us significantcost increases from time to time, and future adverse changes in these costs orthe disruption of the means by which merchandise is transported to us couldcause additional cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain whichcould be significant. Further, we are subject to increased costs or potentialdisruptions impacting any port or trade route through which our products move.If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries or other domesticvendors with foreign sources in different countries, those goods may be moreexpensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones we now sell. Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues isdependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability tosuccessfully open new stores as planned.      Oursales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centerswhere we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop.  In addition, ourability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability tosecure space for and open new stores in attractive locations.  Centers where wecurrently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adverselyaffected by, among other things, general economic downturns or thoseparticularly affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing ofanchor stores, changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shoppingpreferences.  To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shoppingpreferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores indesirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense.A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where wegenerally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centersand locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, limiting ourability to open new stores, could adversely affect consumer traffic and reduceour sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs. 10      Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on manyfactors, some of which are beyond our control.  These factors include, but arenot limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiateacceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals andhire and train appropriate store personnel.  In addition, our continuedexpansion into new regions of the country where we have not done businessbefore may present new challenges in competition, distribution andmerchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully andtimely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these storesto perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, resultsof operations and financial condition. The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods ontime and to the Company’s specification may adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on third-party vendors tomanufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that ourvendors will fail to perform as we expect.  For example, the deterioration inany of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandisein a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to followour vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, includingcompliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us tooperational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks.  If we are notable to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source withmerchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect,our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.  Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the UnitedStates further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations andcompliance risks, as discussed below under “Our business operations subject usto legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatoryenforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities,divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.” The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may presentincreased legal and operational risks.      In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. Ourexperience with legal and regulatory practices and requirements in Asia islimited. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandiseproduction to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company’sspecifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operationsand financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further,the activities conducted by our sourcing office outside the United Statesfurther subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. andinternational regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this“Risk Factors
” section, in particular below under “Our business operationssubject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations andregulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs orliabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.” Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditionsthat drive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affectconsumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.      Consumerspending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, areaffected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions and uncertainties,political conditions and uncertainties (such as those currently being debatedin the U.S. regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies), levels ofemployment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates and othersources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, the availabilityof consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptions of adversechanges in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Any perception thatthese conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negatively maysignificantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits. Adverseperceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding them also generallycause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to ourmerchandise, all of which may also adversely affect our net sales and resultsof operations.  In addition, numerous events, whether or not related to actualeconomic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war orterrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, or similar events, may alsodampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumerspending.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.11  Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality ofinventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be ableto pass on to its customers.      Vendors are increasingly passing on higher production costs, which may impactour ability to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of rawmaterials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields,currency value fluctuations, as well as other factors.  Additionally,manufacturers have and may continue to have increases in other manufacturingcosts, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases inproduction costs result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. Due to theCompany’s limited flexibility in price point, the Company may not be able topass on those cost increases to the consumer, which could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.         Afailure or disruption relating to our information technology systems couldadversely affect our business.       We rely on our existing informationtechnology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning,replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technologysystems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems,including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales,banking, inventory and fixed assets.  Despite the precautions we take, ourinformation systems may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerousevents, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weatherconditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber attacks, acts of waror terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control orthat we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of ourinformation technology systems, our failure to continue to upgrade or improvesuch systems, or the cost associated with maintaining, repairing or improvingthese systems, could adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current informationtechnology systems may also disrupt our operations.  A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distributioncenter or transportation network could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness and results of operations.      The distribution of our products is centralized in onedistribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through ournetwork of third-party freight carriers.  The merchandise we purchase isshipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipmentto the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by our third-partyfreight carriers.  If the distribution center or our third-party freightcarriers were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason,including but not limited to, any of the causes described under “A failure ordisruption relating to our information technology systems could adverselyaffect our business,” our operations would likely be seriously disrupted.  Suchproblems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment ofour ability to use our distribution center, as well as any broader problemgenerally affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center ordeliver goods to our stores.  As a result, we could incur significantly highercosts and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to ourstores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the distributioncenter and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence could adverselyaffect our business, results of operations and financial condition.         Changesto accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported resultsof operations and   financial condition.12       Inan effort to provide greater comparability of financial reporting in anincreasing global environment, accounting regulatory authorities have been indiscussions for many years regarding efforts to either converge U.S. GenerallyAccepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting Standards(“IFRS”), have U.S. companies provide supplemental IFRS-based information orcontinue to work toward a single set of globally accepted accounting standards.If implemented, these potential changes in accounting rules or regulationscould significantly impact our future reported results of operations andfinancial position.  Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varyinginterpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have significantlyaffected our reported financial statements and those of other participants inthe retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future.       For example, changes to lease accounting standardseffective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019 will require lessees tocapitalize operating leases in their financial statements. These changes willhave a major impact on the Company as a retailer with numerous leasedlocations. Such changes will require us to record a significant amount oflease-related assets and liabilities on, and will materially affect, ourbalance sheet and will require us to make other changes to the recording andclassification of lease-related expenses on our statements of income and cashflows. These changes could lead to the perception by investors that we arehighly leveraged and would change the calculation of numerous financial metricsand measures of our performance and financial condition. These and other futurechanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reportedresults of operations and financial position. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate newbusinesses into its existing business, the Company’s financial condition andresults of operations will be adversely affected.      The Company’s long-termbusiness strategy includes opportunistic growth through the development of newstore concepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures andmanagement attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipatedbenefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipatedamounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costsrelated to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our storesare not successful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. Ifwe cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial conditionand results of operations may be adversely impacted.  A security breach that results inunauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information couldadversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations, and effortsto mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.  The protection of employee, Company and customer data iscritical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programmingerror or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or otherunauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, includingbut not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiableinformation, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it toremediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt itsoperations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financialcondition. Despite measures the Company takes to protect confidentialinformation, which are ongoing and may continue to increase our costs, there isno assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of suchinformation. The security of certain of this information also depends on theability of third-party service providers, such as those we use to processcredit and debit card payments as described below under “We are subject topayment-related risks,” to properly handle and protect such information. If anysuch compromise or unauthorized disclosure of this information were to occur,it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business,operating results, financial condition and cash flows. We are subject to payment-related risks.  We accept payments using a variety ofmethods, including third-party credit cards, our own branded credit cards, debitcards, gift cards and physical bank checks. For existing and future payment methods we offer to our customers, we maybecome subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (includingobligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result inincreased costs and reduce the ease of useof certain payment methods), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods,including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which mayincrease over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. Werely on third-party service providers forpayment processing services, including the processing of credit and debitcards. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these third-party serviceproviders become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment cardassociation operating rules, including data security rules, certificationrequirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could changeor be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rulesor requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks’ costs, subject to finesand higher transaction fees. In addition we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments fromour customers and process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other typesof payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.13  The Company’s failure to successfully operate itse-commerce websites or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impactcustomer satisfaction, our reputation and our business.            Although the Company's e-commerce platform providesanother channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers theon-line shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base,it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures inthe efficient and uninterrupted operation of our websites, customer contactcenter or our distribution center, including system failures caused bytelecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our presentsystem capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error. Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security ordata breaches involving the unauthorized disclosure of customer information, asdiscussed above under “A security breach that results in unauthorizeddisclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affectour costs, reputation and results of operations, and efforts to mitigate theserisks may continue to increase our costs.” We are also subject to risk relatedto delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such as shippingcompanies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdowns oradverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet thechallenges of operating e-commerce websites or fulfilling customerexpectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected. Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect ourbusiness and our financial condition.            From time to time the Company is involved inlitigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise fromour normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, andcould require significant management time. The Company’s periodic evaluation oflitigation-related matters may change our assessment in light of the discoveryof facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently knownto us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We mayalso be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions orsettlements of disputes may negatively impact our business, reputation andfinancial condition. Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnelcould adversely affect our business and our financial condition.      Like most retailers, we experiencesignificant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associatesand managers.  Because our continued store growth will require the hiring andtraining of new associates, we must continually attract, hire and train newstore associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in theturnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase ourrecruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in ourstore operating efficiency and productivity.  We compete for qualified storeassociates, as well as experienced management personnel, withother companies in our industry or other industries, many of whom have greaterfinancial resources than we do.14  In addition, we depend on key management personnel tooversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of ourexisting business and future expansion. The success of executing our businessstrategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for keymanagement personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract andretain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.      Ifwe are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract,train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able toservice our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which couldadversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business operations subject us to legal compliance andlitigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities,which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’sattention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.      Our operations are subject to federal, state and locallaws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulationsrelating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source ourmerchandise and operate our sourcing offices.  Our business is also subject toregulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreignjurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems forresolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisenand may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include,among other issues, intellectual property issues, employment issues, commercialdisputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injuryclaims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and internationalregulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license andpermit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and dataprotection laws, environmental laws, records and information managementregulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting onthe Company’s behalf may result in significant investigation costs, severecriminal or civil sanctions and reputational harm.  These and other liabilitiesto which we may be subject could negatively affect our business, operatingresults and financial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factualand legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divertsignificant management time.  The Company may also be subject to regulatoryreview and audits, which results may have the potential to materially and adverselyaffect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Inaddition, governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations ofexisting laws are subject to change from time to time.  Compliance andlitigation matters could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as wellas have an adverse effect on our operations and our reputation.      New legislation or regulation andinterpretation of existing laws and regulations related to data privacy couldincrease our costs of compliance, technology and business operations. Theinterpretation of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices canbe uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost.          If we fail to protect our trademarks and otherintellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights ofothers, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations andfinancial condition could be adversely affected.      We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’sFashion Metro” and “Versona” trademarks are integral to our store designs,brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty.Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice (“PTO”) and have also registered, or appliedfor registration of, additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe areimportant to our business, we cannot assure that these registrations willprevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs orprivate label merchandise or the infringement of our other intellectualproperty rights by others. Infringement of our names, concepts, store designsor merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesserquality or carries a negative connotation of our image could adversely affectour business, financial condition and results of operations.15      In addition, we cannot assure that others will not try to blockthe manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that ourmerchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights. In the eventof such a conflict, we could be subject to lawsuits or other actions, theultimate resolution of which we cannot predict; however, such a controversycould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. We may experience market conditions that could adverselyimpact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, ourshort-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.      Our short-term investmentsand cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state,municipal and corporate debt securities.  The value of those securities may beimpacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes to credit ratings,rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality ofmarket credit and liquidity.  As federal, state and municipal entities strugglewith declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of ourability to timely access these investments if the market for these issuesdeclines.  Similarly, the default by issuers could adversely affect ourfinancial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our businessstrategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalentsat financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insuredlimits.  An economic downturn or development of adverse conditionsaffecting the financial sector and stability of financial institutions couldcause us to experience losses on our deposits. Maintaining and improving our internal control overfinancial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a publiccompany may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controlsmay negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and marketconfidence in our reported financial information.      Asa public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules ofthe SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank WallStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and relatedrule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the nextseveral years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements ofthese rules and regulations have, and may continue to, increase our compliancecosts and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Tosatisfy the SEC’s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of theSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor andenhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly andtime-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot giveassurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controlover financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequatein the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws andregulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we maybecome subject in the future, as a public company could have an adversematerial impact on our business, our financial condition and the price of ourcommon stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these requirements,particularly with new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act that have yet to beimplemented, could significantly increase our compliance costs.      Unusual weather, natural disasters or similar events may adversely affect oursales or operations. 16      Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters or similarevents can influence customer trends and shopping habits.  For example, heavyrainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might makeit difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce oursales and profitability.  Our business is also susceptible to unseasonableweather conditions.  For example, extended periods of unseasonably warmtemperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer seasoncould render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonableconditions.  Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weatherconditions would adversely affect our business.  The occurrence or threat ofextreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks offlu or other communicable diseases or other catastrophic events could reducecustomer traffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conductoperations, which could materially and adversely affect us. Risks Relating To The Market Value Of Our Common Stock:         Ouroperating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, whichcould adversely affect the             market price of our common stock.      Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of theretail apparel industry.  As a result, our stores typically generate a higherpercentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and secondquarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters.  Accordingly, ouroperating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative ofresults to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterlyfluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of a principal shareholder may limit theability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company.      As of March 27, 2019, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, beneficially controlled approximately 45.7% of the voting power of ourcommon stock.  As a result, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantlyinfluence substantially all matters requiring approval by the shareholders,including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and otherbusiness combinations or other significant Company transactions. Mr. Cato mayhave interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in away with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to theirinterests.  In addition, the concentration of voting power held by Mr. Catocould have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change incontrol of the Company, which could depress the market price of our commonstock. Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularlyrelating to our industry, Company or common stock, may materially and adverselyaffect the market price of our common stock and make its trading price morevolatile.      The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely tocontinue to be, subject to significant volatility.  A variety offactors may cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhapssubstantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in thisreport, as well as the following: low trading volume; general marketfluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations orthe inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments relatedto our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; generalconditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the fashion and retailindustry; conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the domestic orglobal economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes infinancial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securitiesanalysts; negative commentary regarding our Company and correspondingshort-selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments;significant changes in our senior management team; and legal proceedings. Over the past several years the stock market in general, and the market forshares of equity securities of many retailers in particular, have experiencedextreme price fluctuations that have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies.  Suchfluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors maymaterially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.17  "
6,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2018-03-27,">Item 1A.     RiskFactors:      An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks.  You shouldcarefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other informationcontained in this report, including the disclosures under “Forward-lookingInformation” above in evaluating our Company and any potential investment inour common stock.  If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur, ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be materially andadversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and youcould lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock.  The risks anduncertainties described in this section are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that wecurrently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our businessoperating results and financial condition. Risks Relating To Our Business: If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond torapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, ourbusiness and results of operations could materially suffer.       Customertastes and fashion trends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tendto change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty.  Our success dependsin part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond tochanging merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond tochanging fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of ourmerchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operationsand our image with our customers.  If we miscalculate either the market for ourmerchandise or our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, we may be requiredto sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups overcost, or below cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results ofoperations. Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability toeffectively manage inventory may negatively impact our gross margin and ouroverall results of operations. Comparable sales are expected to continue to fluctuate inthe future. Factors affecting comparable sales include fashion trends, customerpreferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather and economicconditions. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of theapplicable selling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we arenot able to accurately predict customers’ preferences for our fashion items, wemay have too much inventory which may cause excessive markdowns. If we areunable to accurately predict demand for our merchandise, we may end up with inventory shortages resulting in missed sales. A decreasein comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory mayadversely affect our gross margin and results of operations.9       Existingand increased competition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negativelyimpact our business,              results of operations, financial conditionand market share.      The women’s retail apparel industryis highly competitive.  We compete primarily with discount stores,mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty storesand internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greaterfinancial, marketing and other resources than we have.  Many of ourcompetitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices.  In somecases our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significantmarket presence.  In addition, our competitors also compete for thesame retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experiencepricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to opennew stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially andadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Because we source a significant portion of our merchandisedirectly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated withinternational operations; changes, disruptions, cost changes or other problemsaffecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain could materially and adverselyaffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.       Asignificant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in East Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remainingmerchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreignsources.  As a result, political, financial or other forms of instability orother events resulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting oursupply chain, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or theimposition of additional regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs,taxes or governmental policies regarding these matters or other factorsaffecting the availability or cost of imports, could cause significant delaysor interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. Ourcosts are also affected by currency fluctuations, and changes in the value ofthe dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold.Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business andresults of operations.  In addition, increased energy and transportation costshave caused us significant cost increases from time to time, and future adversechanges in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise istransported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of oursupply chain which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increasedcosts or potential disruptions impacting any port or trade route through whichour products move. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countriesor other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, thosegoods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the oneswe now sell. Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues isdependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability tosuccessfully open new stores as planned.      Oursales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centerswhere we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop.  In addition, ourability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability tosecure space for and open new stores in attractive locations.  Centers where wecurrently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adverselyaffected by, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularlyaffecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores,changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shoppingpreferences.  To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shoppingpreferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores indesirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense.A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where wegenerally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centersand locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, limiting ourability to open new stores, could adversely affect consumer traffic and reduceour sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs.10       Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on manyfactors, some of which are beyond our control.  These factors include, but arenot limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiateacceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals andhire and train appropriate store personnel.  In addition, our continuedexpansion into new regions of the country where we have not done businessbefore may present new challenges in competition, distribution andmerchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully andtimely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these storesto perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, resultsof operations and financial condition. The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods ontime and to the Company’s specification may adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on third-party vendors tomanufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that ourvendors will fail to perform as we expect.  For example, the deterioration inany of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandisein a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to followour vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, includingcompliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us tooperational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks.  If we are notable to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source withmerchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect,our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.  Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the UnitedStates further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations andcompliance risks, as discussed below under “Our business operations subject usto legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatoryenforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities,divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.” The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may presentincreased legal and operational risks.      In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. Ourexperience with legal and regulatory practices and requirements in Asia islimited. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandiseproduction to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company’sspecifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operationsand financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further,the activities conducted by our sourcing office outside the United Statesfurther subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. andinternational regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this“Risk Factors
” section, in particular below under “Our business operationssubject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations andregulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs orliabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.” Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditionsthat drive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affectconsumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.      Consumerspending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, areaffected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions anduncertainties, political conditions and uncertainties (such as those currentlybeing debated in the U.S. regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies),levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates andother sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, theavailability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptionsof adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Anyperception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negativelymay significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits.Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regardingthem also generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items,such as our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to ourmerchandise, all of which may also adversely affect our net sales and resultsof operations.  In addition, numerous events, whether or not related to actualeconomic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war orterrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, or similar events, may alsodampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumerspending.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.11  Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality ofinventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be ableto pass on to its customers.      Vendors are increasingly passing on higher production costs, which may impactour ability to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of rawmaterials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, aswell as other factors.  Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue tohave increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor andbenefit costs. These increases in production costs result in higher merchandisecosts to the Company. Due to the Company’s limited flexibility in price point,the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer,which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition.         Afailure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adverselyaffect our business.       We rely on our existing informationtechnology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning,replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technologysystems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems,including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales,banking, inventory and fixed assets.  Despite the precautions we take, ourinformation systems may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerousevents, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weatherconditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber attacks, acts of waror terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control orthat we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of ourinformation technology systems, our failure to continue to upgrade or improvesuch systems, or the cost associated with maintaining, repairing or improvingthese systems, could adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current informationtechnology systems may also disrupt our operations.  A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distributioncenter or transportation network could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness and results of operations.      The distribution of our products is centralized in onedistribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through ournetwork of third-party freight carriers.  The merchandise we purchase isshipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipmentto the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by ourthird-party freight carriers.  If the distribution center or our third-partyfreight carriers were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for anyreason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described under “A failureor disruption relating to our information technology systems could adverselyaffect our business,” our operations would likely be seriously disrupted.  Suchproblems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment ofour ability to use our distribution center, as well as any broader problemgenerally affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center ordeliver goods to our stores.  As a result, we could incur significantly highercosts and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to ourstores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the distributioncenter and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence could adverselyaffect our business, results of operations and financial condition.         Changesto accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported resultsof operations and   financial condition.12       Inan effort to provide greater comparability of financial reporting in anincreasing global environment, accounting regulatory authorities have been indiscussions for many years regarding efforts to either converge U.S. GenerallyAccepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting Standards(“IFRS”), have U.S. companies provide supplemental IFRS-based information orcontinue to work toward a single set of globally accepted accounting standards.If implemented, these potential changes in accounting rules or regulationscould significantly impact our future reported results of operations andfinancial position.  Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varyinginterpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have significantlyaffected our reported financial statements and those of other participants inthe retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future.       For example, pending changes to lease accounting standardswill require lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financialstatements. These changes will have a major impact on the Company as a retailerwith numerous leased locations. Such changes will require us to record asignificant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities on our balance sheetand make other changes to the recording and classification of lease-relatedexpenses on our statements of income and cash flows. These changes could leadto the perception by investors that we are highly leveraged and would changethe calculation of numerous financial metrics and measures of our performanceand financial condition. These and other future changes to accounting rules orregulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations andfinancial position. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate newbusinesses into its existing business, the Company’s financial condition andresults of operations will be adversely affected.      The Company’s long-termbusiness strategy includes growth through the development of new storeconcepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures andmanagement attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipatedbenefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipatedamounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costsrelated to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our storesare not successful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. Ifwe cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial conditionand results of operations may be adversely impacted.  A security breach that results inunauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information couldadversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operation, and efforts tomitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.  The protection of employee, Company and customer data iscritical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programmingerror or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or otherunauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, includingbut not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiableinformation, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it toremediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt itsoperations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financialcondition. Despite measures the Company takes to protect confidentialinformation, which are ongoing and may continue to increase our costs, there isno assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of suchinformation. If any such compromise or unauthorized disclosure of thisinformation were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on theCompany's reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cashflows. We are subject to payment-related risks.  We accept payments using a variety of methods, including third-party credit cards, our own brandedcredit cards, debit cards, gift cards and physical bank checks. For existingand future payment methods we offer to our customers, we may become subject toadditional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligationsto implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increasedcosts and reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods), as well as fraud.For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we payinterchange and other fees, which mayincrease over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. Werely on third-party service providers for payment processing services,including the processing of credit and debit cards. In each case, it coulddisrupt our business if these third-partyservice providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including datasecurity rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or bereinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we failto comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems arebreached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks’ costs, subject to finesand higher transaction fees. In addition we may lose our ability to accept credit anddebit card payments from our customers and process electronic funds transfersor facilitate other types of payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.13  The Company’s failure to successfully operate itse-commerce website or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impactcustomer satisfaction, our reputation and our business.            Although the Company's e-commerce platform providesanother channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers theon-line shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base,it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures inthe efficient and uninterrupted operation of our website, customer contactcenter or our distribution center, including system failures caused bytelecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our presentsystem capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error. Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security ordata breaches involving the unauthorized disclosure of customer information, asdiscussed above under “A security breach that results in unauthorizeddisclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affectour costs, reputation and results of operations.” We are also subject to riskrelated to delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such asshipping companies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdownsor adverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet thechallenges of operating an e-commerce website or fulfilling customerexpectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected. Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect ourbusiness and our financial condition.            From time to time the Company is involved inlitigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise fromour normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, andcould require significant management time. The Company’s periodic evaluation oflitigation-related matters may change our assessment in light of the discoveryof facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently knownto us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We mayalso be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions orsettlements of disputes may negatively impact our business and our financialcondition. Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnelcould adversely affect our business and our financial condition.      Like most retailers, we experiencesignificant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associatesand managers.  Because our continued store growth will require the hiring andtraining of new associates, we must continually attract, hire and train newstore associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in theturnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase ourrecruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in ourstore operating efficiency and productivity.  We compete for qualified storeassociates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companiesin our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financialresources than we do. 14 In addition, we depend on key management personnel tooversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of ourexisting business and future expansion. The success of executing our businessstrategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for keymanagement personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract andretain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.      Ifwe are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract,train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able toservice our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which couldadversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business operations subject us to legal compliance andlitigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities,which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’sattention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.      Our operations are subject to federal, state and locallaws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulationsrelating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source ourmerchandise and operate our sourcing offices.  Our business is also subject toregulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreignjurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems forresolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisenand may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include,among other issues, intellectual property issues, employment issues, commercialdisputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injuryclaims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and internationalregulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license andpermit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and dataprotection laws, environmental laws, records and information managementregulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting onthe Company’s behalf may result in significant investigation costs and severecriminal or civil sanctions.  These and other liabilities to which we may besubject could negatively affect our business, operating results and financialcondition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues,which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significantmanagement time.  The Company may also be subject to regulatory review andaudits, which results may have the potential to materially and adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition,governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations of existing laws aresubject to change from time to time.  Compliance and litigation matters couldresult in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effecton our operations and our reputation.         If we fail to protect our trademarks and otherintellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights ofothers, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations andfinancial condition could be adversely affected.      We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’sFashion Metro” and “Versona” trademarks are integral to our store designs,brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty.Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice (“PTO”) and have also registered, or applied for registration of,additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to ourbusiness, we cannot assure that these registrations will prevent imitation ofour trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private labelmerchandise or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights byothers. Infringement of our names, concepts, store designs or merchandisegenerally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carriesa negative connotation of our image could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations. 15      In addition, we cannot assure thatothers will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our private labelmerchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks or otherproprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subject tolawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannot predict;however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations. We may experience market conditions that could adverselyimpact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, ourshort-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.      Our short-term investmentsand cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state,municipal and corporate debt securities.  The value of those securities may beimpacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes to credit ratings,rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality ofmarket credit and liquidity.  As federal, state and municipal entities strugglewith declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of ourability to timely access these investments if the market for these issuesdeclines.  Similarly, the default by issuers could adversely affect ourfinancial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our businessstrategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalentsat financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits. An economic downturn or development of adverse conditions affecting thefinancial sector and stability of financial institutions could cause us toexperience losses on our deposits. Maintaining and improving our internal control overfinancial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a publiccompany may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controlsmay negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and marketconfidence in our reported financial information.      Asa public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules ofthe SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank WallStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and relatedrule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the nextseveral years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements ofthese rules and regulations have, and may continue to, increase our compliancecosts and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Tosatisfy the SEC’s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of theSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor andenhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly andtime-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot giveassurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controlover financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequatein the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws andregulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we maybecome subject in the future, as a public company could have an adversematerial impact on our business, our financial condition and the price of ourcommon stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these requirements, particularlywith new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act that have yet to be implemented,could significantly increase our compliance costs.      Unusual weather, natural disasters or similar events may adversely affect oursales or operations.      Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters or similarevents can influence customer trends and shopping habits.  For example, heavyrainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might makeit difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce oursales and profitability.  Our business is also susceptible to unseasonableweather conditions.  For example, extended periods of unseasonably warmtemperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer seasoncould render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonableconditions.  Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weatherconditions would adversely affect our business.  The occurrence or threat ofextreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or other communicable diseases or othercatastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our stores and likewisedisrupt our ability to conduct operations, which could materially and adverselyaffect us.16  Risks Relating To The Market Value Of Our Common Stock:         Ouroperating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, whichcould adversely affect the             market price of our common stock.      Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of theretail apparel industry.  As a result, our stores typically generate a higherpercentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and secondquarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters.  Accordingly, ouroperating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative ofresults to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterlyfluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of a principal shareholder may limit theability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company.      As of March 27, 2018, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, beneficially controlled approximately 44.5% of the voting power of ourcommon stock.  As a result, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantlyinfluence substantially all matters requiring approval by the shareholders,including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and otherbusiness combinations or other significant Company transactions. Mr. Cato mayhave interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in away with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to theirinterests.  In addition, the concentration of voting power held by Mr. Catocould have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change incontrol of the Company, which could depress the market price of our commonstock. Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularlyrelating to our industry, Company or common stock, may materially and adverselyaffect the market price of our common stock and make its trading price morevolatile.      The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely tocontinue to be, subject to significant volatility.  A variety offactors may cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhapssubstantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in thisreport, as well as the following: low trading volume; general marketfluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations orthe inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments relatedto our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; generalconditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the fashion and retailindustry; conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the domestic orglobal economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes infinancial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securitiesanalysts; negative commentary regarding our Company and correspondingshort-selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments;significant changes in our senior management team; and legal proceedings. Over the past several years the stock market in general, and the market forshares of equity securities of many retailers in particular, have experiencedextreme price fluctuations that have at times been unrelated to the operatingperformance of those companies.  Such fluctuations and marketvolatility based on these or other factors may materially and adversely affectthe market price of our common stock. "
3,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2017-03-23,">Item 1A.     RiskFactors:      An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks.  You shouldcarefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the otherinformation contained in this report, including the disclosures under“Forward-looking Information” above in evaluating our Company and any potentialinvestment in our common stock.  If any of the following risks or uncertaintiesoccur, our business, financial condition and operating results could bematerially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock coulddecline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our commonstock.  The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the onlyones facing us.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to usor that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affectour business operating results and financial condition. Risks Relating To Our Business: If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond torapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, ourbusiness and results of operations could materially suffer.       Customertastes and fashion trends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tendto change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty.  Our success dependsin part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond tochanging merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond tochanging fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of ourmerchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business and our imagewith our customers.  If we miscalculate either the market for our merchandiseor our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell asignificant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, orbelow cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations. Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability toeffectively manage inventory may negatively impact our gross margin and ouroverall results of operations. Comparable sales are expected to continue to fluctuate inthe future. Factors affecting comparable sales include fashion trends, customerpreferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather and economicconditions. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of theapplicable selling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we arenot able to accurately predict customers’ preferences of our fashion items, wemay have too much inventory which may cause excessive markdowns. If we areunable to accurately predict demand for our merchandise, we may end up withinventory shortages resulting in missed sales. A decrease in comparable salesor our inability to effectively manage inventory may adversely affect our grossmargin and results of operations.      Existingand increased competition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negativelyimpact our business,              results of operations, financial conditionand market share.      The women’s retail apparel industryis highly competitive.  We compete primarily with discount stores,mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty storesand internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greaterfinancial, marketing and other resources than we have.  Many of ourcompetitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices.  In somecases our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significantmarket presence.  In addition, our competitors also compete for thesame retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experiencepricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to opennew stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially andadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.9 Because we source a significant portion of our merchandisedirectly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated withinternational operations; changes, disruptions, cost changes or other problemsaffecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain could materially and adverselyaffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.       Asignificant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in East Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remainingmerchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreignsources.  As a result, political, financial or other forms of instability orother events resulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting oursupply chain, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or theimposition of additional regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs,taxes or other factors affecting the availability or cost of imports, couldcause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise orincrease our costs. Our costs are also affected by currency fluctuations, andchanges in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increaseour cost of goods sold. Any of these factors could have a material adverseeffect on our business.  In addition, increased energy and transportation costshave caused us significant cost increases from time to time, and future adversechanges in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise istransported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of oursupply chain which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increasedcosts or potential disruptions impacting any port or trade route through whichour products move. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countriesor other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, thosegoods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the oneswe now sell. Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues isdependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability tosuccessfully open new stores as planned.      Oursales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centerswhere we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop.  In addition, ourability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability tosecure space for and open new stores in attractive locations.  Centers where wecurrently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adverselyaffected by, among other things, general economic downturns or thoseparticularly affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing ofanchor stores, changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shoppingpreferences.  To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shoppingpreferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores indesirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense.A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where wegenerally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centersand locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, limiting ourability to open new stores, could adversely affect consumer traffic and reduceour sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs.      Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on manyfactors, some of which are beyond our control.  These factors include, but arenot limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiateacceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals andhire and train appropriate store personnel.  In addition, our continuedexpansion into new regions of the country where we have not done businessbefore may present new challenges in competition, distribution andmerchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully andtimely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these storesto perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, resultsof operations and financial condition. The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods ontime and to the Company’s specification may adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on third-party vendors tomanufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that ourvendors will fail to perform as we expect.  For example, the deterioration inany of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandisein a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to followour vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations,including compliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, couldexpose us to operational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks. If we are not able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currentlysource with merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to performas we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition couldbe adversely affected.  Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside theUnited States further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulationsand compliance risks, as discussed below under “Our business operations subjectus to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations andregulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs orliabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.”10  The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may presentincreased legal and operational risks.      In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. Ourexperience with legal and regulatory practices and requirements in Asia islimited. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandiseproduction to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company’sspecifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operationsand financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further,the activities conducted by our sourcing office outside the United Statesfurther subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. andinternational regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this“Risk Factors
” section, in particular below under “Our business operationssubject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations andregulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs orliabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.” Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions thatdrive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affectconsumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.      Consumerspending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, areaffected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions anduncertainties, political conditions and uncertainties (such as those currentlybeing debated in the U.S. regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies),levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates andother sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, theavailability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptionsof adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Anyperception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trendnegatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spendinghabits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding themalso generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, suchas our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, allof which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations.  Inaddition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual economicconditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism,political unrest or natural disasters, or similar events, may also dampenconsumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending.  Anyof these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality ofinventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be ableto pass on to its customers.      Vendors are increasingly passing on higher production costs, which may impactour ability to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of rawmaterials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, aswell as other factors.  Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue tohave increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor andbenefit costs. These increases in production costs result in higher merchandisecosts to the Company. Due to the Company’s limited flexibility in price point,the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases tothe consumer, which could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition.11          A failureor disruption relating to our information technology systems could adverselyaffect our business.       We rely on our existing informationtechnology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning,replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technologysystems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems,including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales,banking, inventory and fixed assets.  Despite the precautions we take, ourinformation systems may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerousevents, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weatherconditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber attacks, acts of waror terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control orthat we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of ourinformation technology systems, or our failure to continue to upgrade orimprove such systems could adversely affect our business. Modifications and/orupgrades to our current information technology systems may also disrupt ouroperations.  A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distributioncenter or transportation network could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness and results of operations.      The distribution of our products is centralized in onedistribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through ournetwork of third-party freight carriers.  The merchandise we purchase isshipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipmentto the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by ourthird-party freight carriers.  If the distribution center or our third-partyfreight carriers were to be shutdown or lose significant capacity for anyreason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described under “Afailure or disruption relating to our information technology systems couldadversely affect our business,” our operations would likely be seriouslydisrupted.  Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction orimpairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as well as anybroader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into ourdistribution center or deliver goods to our stores.  As a result, we couldincur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated withdistributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us toreopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network.Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operationsand financial condition.         Changesto accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported resultsof operations and   financial condition.      Inan effort to provide greater comparability of financial reporting in anincreasing global environment, accounting regulatory authorities have been indiscussions for many years regarding efforts to either converge U.S. GenerallyAccepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting Standards(“IFRS”), have U.S. companies provide supplemental IFRS-based information orcontinue to work toward a single set of globally accepted accounting standards.These potential changes in accounting rules or regulations may significantlyimpact our future reported results of operations and financial position. Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations ofexisting accounting rules and regulations have significantly affected ourreported financial statements and those of other participants in the retailindustry in the past and may continue to do so in the future.       For example, pending changes to lease accounting standardswill require lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financialstatements in the future. These changes will have a major impact on the Companyas a retailer with numerous leased locations. Such changes will require us torecord a significant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities on ourbalance sheet and make other changes to the recording and classification oflease-related expenses on our statements of income and cash flows. Thesechanges could lead to the perception by investors that we are highly leveragedand would change the calculation of numerous financial metrics and measures ofour performance and financial condition. These and other futurechanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reportedresults of operations and financial position.12  If the Company is unable to successfully integrate newbusinesses into its existing business, the Company’s financial condition andresults of operations will be adversely affected.      The Company’s long-termbusiness strategy includes growth through the development of new storeconcepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures andmanagement attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipatedbenefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipatedamounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costsrelated to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our storesare not successful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. Ifwe cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial conditionand results of operations may be adversely impacted.  A security breach that results inunauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information couldadversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations.  The protection of employee, Company and customer data iscritical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programmingerror or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or otherunauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, includingbut not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiableinformation, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it toremediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt itsoperations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financialcondition. Despite measures the Company has taken to protect confidentialinformation, there is no assurance that such measures will prevent thecompromise of such information. If any such compromise or unauthorizeddisclosure of this information were to occur, it could have a material adverseeffect on the Company's reputation, business, operating results, financialcondition and cash flows. We are subject to payment-related risks.  We accept payments using a variety ofmethods, including third-party credit cards, our own brandedcredit cards, debit cards, gift cards and physical bank checks. For existing and future payment methods we offer to ourcustomers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliancerequirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authenticationprocesses that could result in increased costsand reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods), as well as fraud. Forcertain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchangeand other fees, which may increase over time, raising our operating costs andlowering profitability. We rely onthird-party service providers for payment processing services, including theprocessing of credit and debit cards. In each case, it could disrupt ourbusiness if these third-party service providers become unwilling or unable toprovide these services to us. We are alsosubject to payment card association operating rules, including data securityrules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic fundstransfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply withthese rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached orcompromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to finesand higher transaction fees. In addition we may loseour ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers andprocess electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of payments, andour business and operating results could be adversely affected. The Company’s failure to successfully operate itse-commerce website or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impactcustomer satisfaction, our reputation and our business.            Although the Company's e-commerce platform providesanother channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers theon-line shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base,it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures inthe efficient and uninterrupted operation of our website, customer contactcenter or our distribution center, including systemfailures caused by telecommunication system providers, order volumes thatexceed our present system capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problemsand human error.  Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greaterpotential for security or data breaches involving the unauthorized disclosureof customer information, as discussed above under “A security breach thatresults in unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer informationcould adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations.” We arealso subject to risk related to delays or failures in the performance of thirdparties, such as shipping companies, including delays associated with laborstrikes or slowdowns or adverse weather conditions. If the Company does notsuccessfully meet the challenges of operating an e-commerce website orfulfilling customer expectations, the Company's business and sales could beadversely affected.13  Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect ourbusiness and our financial condition.            From time to time the Company is involved inlitigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise fromour normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, andcould require significant management time. The Company’s periodic evaluation oflitigation-related matters may change our assessment in light of the discoveryof facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently knownto us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We mayalso be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions maynegatively impact our business and our financial condition. Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnelcould adversely affect our business and our financial condition.      Like most retailers, we experiencesignificant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associatesand managers.  Because our continued store growth will require the hiring andtraining of new associates, we must continually attract, hire and train newstore associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in theturnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase ourrecruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in ourstore operating efficiency and productivity.  We compete for qualified storeassociates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companiesin our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financialresources than we do. In addition, we depend on key management personnel tooversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of ourexisting business and future expansion. The success of executing our businessstrategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for keymanagement personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract andretain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.      Ifwe are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract,train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able toservice our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which couldadversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business operations subject us to legal compliance andlitigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities,which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’sattention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.      Our operations are subject to federal, state and locallaws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulationsrelating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source ourmerchandise and operate our sourcing offices.  Our business is also subject toregulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreignjurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems forresolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisenand may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include,among other issues, intellectual property issues,employment issues, commercial disputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customerrelations and personal injury claims. International activities subject us tonumerous U.S. and international regulations, including but not limited to,restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements, import and exportlicense requirements, privacy and data protection laws, environmental laws,records and information management regulations, tariffs and taxes andanti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, violations ofwhich by employees or persons acting on the Company’s behalf may result insignificant investigation costs and severe criminal or civil sanctions.  Theseand other liabilities to which we may be subject could negatively affect ourbusiness, operating results and financial condition. These matters frequentlyraise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks anduncertainties and could divert significant management time.  The Company mayalso be subject to regulatory review and audits, which results may have thepotential to materially and adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and financial condition. In addition, governing laws, rules andregulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change fromtime to time.  Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpected expensesand liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our operations and ourreputation.14          If we fail to protect our trademarks and otherintellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights ofothers, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations andfinancial condition could be adversely affected.      We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’sFashion Metro” and “Versona” trademarks are integral to our store designs,brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty.Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice (“PTO”) and have also registered, or applied for registration of,additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to ourbusiness, we cannot assure that these registrations will prevent imitation ofour trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private labelmerchandise or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights byothers. Infringement of our names, concepts, store designs or merchandisegenerally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carriesa negative connotation of our image could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations.     In addition, we cannot assure that others will not try to blockthe manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that ourmerchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights. In the eventof such a conflict, we could be subject to lawsuits or other actions, theultimate resolution of which we cannot predict; however, such a controversycould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. We may experience market conditions that could adverselyimpact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, ourshort-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.      Our short-term investmentsand cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state,municipal and corporate debt securities.  The value of those securities may beimpacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes to credit ratings,rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality ofmarket credit and liquidity.  As federal, state and municipal entities strugglewith declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of ourability to timely access these investments if the market for these issuesdeclines.  Similarly, the default by issuers could adversely affect ourfinancial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our businessstrategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalentsat financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits. An economic downturn or development of adverse conditions affecting thefinancial sector and stability of financial institutions could cause us toexperience losses on our deposits.   15 Maintaining and improving our internal control overfinancial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a publiccompany may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controlsmay negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and marketconfidence in our reported financial information.      Asa public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules ofthe SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank WallStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and relatedrule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the nextseveral years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements ofthese rules and regulations have, and may continue to, increase our compliancecosts and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Tosatisfy the SEC’s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of theSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor andenhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly andtime-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot giveassurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controlover financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequatein the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws andregulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we maybecome subject in the future, as a public company could have an adversematerial impact on our business, our financial condition and the price of ourcommon stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these requirements,particularly with new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act that have yet to beimplemented, could significantly increase our compliance costs.      Unusual weather, natural disasters or similar events may adversely affect oursales or operations.      Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters or similarevents can influence customer trends and shopping habits.  For example, heavyrainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might makeit difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce oursales and profitability.  Our business is also susceptible to unseasonableweather conditions.  For example, extended periods of unseasonably warmtemperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer seasoncould render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonableconditions.  Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weatherconditions would adversely affect our business.  The occurrence or threat ofextreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks offlu or other communicable diseases or other catastrophic events could reducecustomer traffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conductoperations, which could materially and adversely affect us. Risks Relating To The Market Value Of Our Common Stock:         Ouroperating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, whichcould adversely affect the             market price of our common stock.      Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of theretail apparel industry.  As a result, our stores typically generate a higherpercentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and secondquarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters.  Accordingly, ouroperating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative ofresults to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterlyfluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of a principal shareholder may limit theability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company.      As of March 23, 2017, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, beneficially controlled approximately 42.6% of the voting power of ourcommon stock.  As a result, Mr. Cato may be able tocontrol or significantly influence substantially all matters requiring approvalby the shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval ofmergers and other business combinations or other significant Companytransactions. Mr. Cato may have interests that differ from those of othershareholders, and may vote in a way with which other shareholders disagree orperceive as adverse to their interests.  In addition, the concentration ofvoting power held by Mr. Cato could have the effect of preventing, discouragingor deferring a change in control of the Company, which could depress the marketprice of our common stock.16  Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularlyrelating to our Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affectthe market price of our common stock and make its trading price more volatile.      The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely tocontinue to be, subject to significant volatility.  A variety offactors may cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhapssubstantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in thisreport, as well as the following: low trading volume; general marketfluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations orthe inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments relatedto our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; generalconditions in the fashion and retail industry; conditions affecting orperceived to affect the domestic or global economy or the domestic or globalcredit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scope ofcoverage given to our Company by securities analysts; negative commentaryregarding our Company and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adversecustomer relations developments; significant changes in our senior managementteam; and legal proceedings.  Over the past several years the stock marketin general, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers inparticular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times beenunrelated to the operating performance of those companies.  Suchfluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors maymaterially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. "
14,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2016-03-24,">Item 1A.     RiskFactors:      An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks.  You shouldcarefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the otherinformation contained in this report, including the disclosures under“Forward-looking Information” above in evaluating our Company and any potentialinvestment in our common stock.  If any of the following risks or uncertaintiesoccur, our business, financial condition and operating results could bematerially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock coulddecline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our commonstock.  The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the onlyones facing us.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to usor that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affectour business operating results and financial condition. Risks Relating To Our Business: If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond torapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, ourbusiness and results of operations could materially suffer.       Customertastes and fashion trends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tendto change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty.  Our success dependsin part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond tochanging merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond tochanging fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of ourmerchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business and our imagewith our customers.  If we miscalculate either the market for our merchandiseor our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell asignificant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, orbelow cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations.      Existingand increased competition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negativelyimpact our business,      results of operations, financial condition and marketshare.      The women’s retail apparel industryis highly competitive.  We compete primarily with discount stores,mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty storesand internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greaterfinancial, marketing and other resources than we have.  Many of ourcompetitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices.  In somecases our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significantmarket presence.  In addition, our competitors also compete for thesame retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experiencepricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to opennew stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially andadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Because we source a significant portion of our merchandisedirectly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated withinternational operations; changes, disruptions, cost changes or other problemsaffecting the Company’s merchandise supply chain could materially and adverselyaffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.       Asignificant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in East Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remainingmerchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreignsources.  As a result, political, financial or other forms of instability orother events resulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting oursupply chain, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or theimposition of additional regulations or changes induties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or other factors affecting the availability orcost of imports, could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supplyof our merchandise or increase our costs. Our costs are also affected bycurrency fluctuations, and changes in the value of the dollar relative toforeign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold. Any of these factorscould have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, increasedenergy and transportation costs have caused us significant cost increases fromtime to time, and future adverse changes in these costs or the disruption ofthe means by which merchandise is transported to us could cause additional costincreases or interruptions of our supply chain which could be significant. Further,we are subject to increased costs or potential disruptions impacting any portor trade route through which our products move. If we are forced to sourcemerchandise from other countries or other domestic vendors with foreign sourcesin different countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different orinferior quality from the ones we now sell.9  The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods ontime and to the Company’s specification may adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on third-party vendors tomanufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that ourvendors will fail to perform as we expect.  For example, the deterioration inany of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandisein a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to followour vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, includingcompliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us tooperational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks.  If we are notable to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source withmerchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect,our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.  Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the UnitedStates further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations and compliancerisks, as discussed below under “Our business operations subject us to legalcompliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatoryenforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities,divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.” The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may presentincreased legal and operational risks.      In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. Ourexperience with legal and regulatory practices and requirements in Asia islimited. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandiseproduction to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company’sspecifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operationsand financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further,the activities conducted by our sourcing office outside the United Statesfurther subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. andinternational regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this“Risk Factors
” section, in particular below under “Our business operationssubject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations andregulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs orliabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.” Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality ofinventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be ableto pass on to its customers.      Vendors are increasingly passing on higher production costs, which may impactour ability to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of rawmaterials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, aswell as other factors.  Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue tohave increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor andbenefit costs. These increases in production costs result in higher merchandisecosts to the Company. Due to the Company’s limited flexibility in price point,the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer,which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition.10   Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditionsthat drive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affectconsumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.      Consumerspending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, areaffected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions anduncertainties, political conditions and uncertainties (such as those currentlybeing debated in the U.S. regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies),levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates andother sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, theavailability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptionsof adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Anyperception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trendnegatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spendinghabits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding themalso generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, suchas our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, allof which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations.  Inaddition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual economicconditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism,political unrest or natural disasters, or similar events, may also dampenconsumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending.  Anyof these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.        Afailure or disruption relating to our information technology systems couldadversely affect our business.       We rely on our existing informationtechnology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning,replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technologysystems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems,including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales,banking, inventory and fixed assets.  Despite the precautions we take, ourinformation systems may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerousevents, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weatherconditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber attacks, acts of waror terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control orthat we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of ourinformation technology systems, or our failure to continue to upgrade orimprove such systems could adversely affect our business. Modifications and/orupgrades to our current information technology systems may also disrupt ouroperations.  A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distributioncenter or transportation network could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness and results of operations.      The distribution of our products is centralized in onedistribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through ournetwork of third-party freight carriers.  The merchandise we purchase isshipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipmentto the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by ourthird-party freight carriers.  If the distribution center or our third-partyfreight carriers were to be shutdown or lose significant capacity for anyreason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described under “Afailure or disruption relating to our information technology systems couldadversely affect our business,” our operations would likely be seriouslydisrupted.  Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction orimpairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as well as anybroader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into ourdistribution center or deliver goods to our stores.  As a result, we couldincur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated withdistributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us toreopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network.Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operationsand financial condition. 11 Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues isdependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability tosuccessfully open new stores as planned.      Oursales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centerswhere we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop.  In addition, ourability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability tosecure space for and open new stores in attractive locations.  Centers where wecurrently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adverselyaffected by, among other things, general economic downturns or thoseparticularly affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing ofanchor stores, changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shoppingpreferences.  To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shoppingpreferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores indesirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense.A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where wegenerally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centersand locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, limiting ourability to open new stores, could adversely affect consumer traffic and reduceour sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs.      Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on manyfactors, some of which are beyond our control.  These factors include, but arenot limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiateacceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals andhire and train appropriate store personnel.  In addition, our continuedexpansion into new regions of the country where we have not done businessbefore may present new challenges in competition, distribution andmerchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully andtimely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these storesto perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.        Changesto accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported resultsof operations and  financial condition.      Inan effort to provide greater comparability of financial reporting in anincreasing global environment, accounting regulatory authorities are enteringinto collaborative efforts to converge U.S. Generally Accepted AccountingPrinciples with International Financial Reporting Standards. These changes inaccounting rules or regulations may significantly impact our future reportedresults of operations and financial position.  Changes in accounting rules orregulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules andregulations have significantly affected our reported financial statements andthose of other participants in the retail industry in the past and may continueto do so in the future.       For example, pending changes to lease accounting standardswill require lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financialstatements in the future. These changes will have a major impact on the Companyas a retailer with numerous leased locations. Such changes will require us torecord a significant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities on ourbalance sheet and make other changes to the recording and classification oflease-related expenses on our statements of income and cash flows. Thesechanges could lead to the perception by investors that we are highly leveragedand would change the calculation of numerous financial metrics and measures ofour performance and financial condition. These and other future changes toaccounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported results ofoperations and financial position. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate newbusinesses into its existing business, the Company’s financial condition andresults of operations will be adversely affected.      The Company’s long-termbusiness strategy includes growth through the development of new storeconcepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures andmanagement attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipatedbenefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipatedamounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costsrelated to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our storesare not successful and that could potentially resultin impairment charges. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies,our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 12  A security breach that results inunauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information couldadversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations.  The protection of employee, Company and customer data iscritical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programmingerror or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or otherunauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, includingbut not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiableinformation, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it toremediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt itsoperations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financialcondition. Despite measures the Company has taken to protect confidentialinformation, there is no assurance that such measures will prevent thecompromise of such information. If any such compromise or unauthorizeddisclosure of this information were to occur, it could have a material adverseeffect on the Company's reputation, business, operating results, financialcondition and cash flows. We are subject to payment-related risks.  We accept payments using a variety ofmethods, including third party credit cards, our own branded credit cards,debit cards, gift cards and physical bank checks.For existing and future payment methods we offer to our customers, we maybecome subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (includingobligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result inincreased costs and reduce the ease of useof certain payment methods), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods,including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which mayincrease over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. We rely on third-party service providers forpayment processing services, including the processing of credit and debitcards. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these third-party serviceproviders become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card associationoperating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements andrules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or bereinterpreted to make it difficult or impossiblefor us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or ifour data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable forcard issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition we may loseour ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers andprocess electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of payments, andour business and operating results could be adversely affected The Company’s failure to successfully operate itse-commerce website or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impactcustomer satisfaction, our reputation and our business.            Although the Company's e-commerce platform providesanother channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers theon-line shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base,it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures inthe efficient and uninterrupted operation of our website, customer contact centeror our distribution center, including system failures caused bytelecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our presentsystem capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error. Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security ordata breaches involving the unauthorized disclosure of customer information, asdiscussed above under “A security breach that results in unauthorizeddisclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affectour costs, reputation and results of operations.” We are also subject to riskrelated to delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such asshipping companies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdownsor adverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet thechallenges of operating an e-commerce website or fulfilling customerexpectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected. 13 Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnelcould adversely affect our business and our financial condition.      Like most retailers, we experiencesignificant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associatesand managers.  Because our continued store growth will require the hiring andtraining of new associates, we must continually attract, hire and train newstore associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in theturnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase ourrecruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in ourstore operating efficiency and productivity.  We compete for qualified storeassociates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companiesin our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financialresources than we do. In addition, we depend on key management personnel tooversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of ourexisting business and future expansion. The success of executing our businessstrategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for keymanagement personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract andretain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.      Ifwe are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract,train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able toservice our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which couldadversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business operations subject us to legal compliance andlitigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities,which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’sattention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.      Our operations are subject to federal, state and locallaws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulationsrelating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source ourmerchandise and operate our sourcing offices.  Our business is also subject toregulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreignjurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems forresolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisenand may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include,among other issues, intellectual property issues, employment issues, commercialdisputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injuryclaims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and internationalregulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license andpermit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and dataprotection laws, environmental laws, records and information managementregulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting onthe Company’s behalf may result in significant investigation costs and severecriminal or civil sanctions.  These and other liabilities to which we may besubject could negatively affect our business, operating results and financialcondition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues,which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significantmanagement time.  The Company may also be subject to regulatory review andaudits, which results maybe have the potential to materially and adverselyaffect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Inaddition, governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations ofexisting laws are subject to change from time to time.  Compliance andlitigation matters could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as wellas have an adverse effect on our operations and our reputation.      14        If we fail toprotect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or infringe theintellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image, growthstrategy, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.      We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’sFashion Metro” and “Versona” trademarks are integral to our store designs,brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty.Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and TrademarkOffice (“PTO”) and have also registered, or applied for registration of,additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to ourbusiness, we cannot assure that these registrations will prevent imitation ofour trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private label merchandiseor the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others.Infringement of our names, concepts, store designs or merchandise generally, orparticularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negativeconnotation of our image could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.     In addition, we cannot assure that others will not try to blockthe manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that ourmerchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights. In the eventof such a conflict, we could be subject to lawsuits or other actions, theultimate resolution of which we cannot predict; however, such a controversycould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. We may experience market conditions that could adverselyimpact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, ourshort-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.      Our short-term investmentsand cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state,municipal and corporate debt securities.  The value of those securities may beimpacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes to credit ratings,rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality ofmarket credit and liquidity.  As federal, state and municipal entities strugglewith declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of ourability to timely access these investments if the market for these issuesdeclines.  Similarly, the default by issuers could adversely affect ourfinancial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our businessstrategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalentsat financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insuredlimits.  An economic downturn or development of adverse conditionsaffecting the financial sector and stability of financial institutions couldcause us to experience losses on our deposits. Maintaining and improving our internal control overfinancial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a publiccompany may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controlsmay negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and marketconfidence in our reported financial information.      Asa public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules ofthe SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank WallStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and relatedrule-making that has been and will continue to be implemented over the nextseveral years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements ofthese rules and regulations have, and may continue to, increase our compliancecosts and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Tosatisfy the SEC’s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of theSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor andenhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly andtime-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot giveassurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controlover financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequatein the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws andregulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we maybecome subject in the future, as a public companycould have an adverse material impact on our business, our financial conditionand the price of our common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply withthese requirements, particularly with new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Actthat have yet to be implemented, could significantly increase our compliancecosts.15  Inventory shrinkage could have a material adverse affect onour business, financial condition and results of operations.             We are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. Although ourinventory shrinkage rates have not been material, or fluctuated significantlyin recent years, we cannot assure you thatactual rates of inventory loss and theft in the future will be within ourestimates or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce theproblem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, ifwe were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increasedsecurity costs to combat inventory theft, it could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.        Governmentenacted healthcare reform could adversely affect our business and results ofoperations.       In March 2010, the United States government enactedhealthcare reform legislation, known as the Patient Protection and AffordableCare Act. This legislation and related guidance expands the Company’sresponsibility for providing employees with insurance coverage that meetsminimum eligibility and coverage requirements or face, alternatively, beginningin 2015, penalties for failure to offer this coverage.  The legislation alsoincludes provisions that will impact the number of individuals with insurancecoverage, the types of coverage and level of health benefits that will berequired and the amount of payment providers performing healthcare serviceswill receive. The full effect of this legislation is expected to continue to bephased in over several years, and could increase healthcare expenses for theCompany and have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. TheCompany is still assessing its potential impact on healthcare expenses.However, to the extent we are required to provide health insurance benefits toour employees that are more extensive than the health insurance benefits wecurrently provide and to a potentially larger proportion of our employees, orpay penalties if we elect not to provide these benefits, our expenses willincrease. If we are unable to offset these cost increases by raising our pricesor cutting other costs, such increased expenses could materially and adverselyaffect our results of operations.      Unusual weather, natural disasters or similar events may adversely affect oursales or operations.      Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters or similarevents can influence customer trends and shopping habits.  For example, heavyrainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might makeit difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce oursales and profitability.  Our business is also susceptible to unseasonableweather conditions.  For example, extended periods of unseasonably warmtemperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer seasoncould render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions wouldadversely affect our business.  The occurrence or threat of extreme weather,natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or othercommunicable diseases or other catastrophic events could reduce customertraffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations,which could materially and adversely affect us. Risks Relating To The Market Value Of Our Common Stock:        Ouroperating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, whichcould adversely affect the           market price of our common stock.      Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of theretail apparel industry.  As a result, our storestypically generate a higher percentage of our annual net sales andprofitability in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year compared toother quarters.  Accordingly, our operating results for any one fiscal periodare not necessarily indicative of results to be expected from any futureperiod, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations could adversely affect themarket price of our common stock.16  The interests of a principal shareholder may limit theability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company.      As of March 23, 2016, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, beneficially controlled approximately 41% of the voting power of ourcommon stock.  As a result, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantlyinfluence substantially all matters requiring approval by the shareholders,including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and otherbusiness combinations or other significant Company transactions.  Mr. Cato mayhave interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in away with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to theirinterests.  In addition, the concentration of voting power held by Mr. Catocould have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change incontrol of the Company, which could depress the market price of our commonstock. Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularlyrelating to our Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affectthe market price of our common stock and make its trading price more volatile.      The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely tocontinue to be, subject to significant volatility.  A variety offactors may cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhapssubstantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in thisreport, as well as the following: low trading volume; general marketfluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations orthe inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments relatedto our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; generalconditions in the fashion and retail industry; conditions affecting or perceivedto affect the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit orcapital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scope of coverage givento our Company by securities analysts; negative commentary regarding ourCompany and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adverse customerrelations developments; significant changes in our senior management team; andlegal proceedings.  Over the past several years the stock market ingeneral, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers inparticular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times beenunrelated to the operating performance of those companies.  Suchfluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors may materiallyand adversely affect the market price of our common stock. "
16,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2015-03-30,">Item 1A.     RiskFactors:       An investment in our commonstock involves numerous types of risks.  You should carefully consider thefollowing risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in thisreport, including the disclosures under “Forward-looking Information” above inevaluating our Company and any potential investment in our common stock.  Ifany of the following risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financialcondition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, thetrading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or apart of your investment in our common stock.  The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed in this section are not the only ones facing us.  Additional risksand uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deemimmaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operatingresults and financial condition. Risks Relating To OurBusiness: If we are unable toanticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends andcustomer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operationscould materially suffer.       Customer tastes and fashiontrends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tend to change rapidlyand cannot be predicted with certainty.  Our success depends in part upon ourability to consistently anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trendsand consumer preferences in a timely manner.  Accordingly, any failure by us toanticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trends could adverselyaffect consumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turn could adverselyaffect our business and our image with our customers.  If we miscalculateeither the market for our merchandise or our customers’ tastes or purchasinghabits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory atbelow average markups over cost, or below cost, which would adversely affectour margins and results of operations.      Existing and increased competition in the women’sretail apparel industry may negatively impact our business,                resultsof operations, financial condition and market share.      Thewomen’s retail apparel industry is highly competitive.  We competeprimarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers, department stores,off-price retailers, specialty stores and internet-based retailers, many ofwhich have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources thanwe have.  Many of our competitors offer frequent promotions andreduce their selling prices.   In some cases our competitors are expanding intomarkets in which we have a significant market presence.  As a resultof this competition, including close-out sales and going-out-of-business salesby other women’s apparel retailers, we may experience pricing pressures,increased marketing expenditures, as well as loss of market share, which couldmaterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financialcondition.       Unusual weather, naturaldisasters or similar events may adversely affect our sales or operations.      Extreme changes in weather,natural disasters or similar events can influence customer trends and shoppinghabits.  For example, heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over aprolonged period might make it difficult for ourcustomers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales andprofitability.  Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during thewinter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portionof our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions.  Reducedsales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions would adverselyaffect our business.  The occurrence or threat of extreme weather, naturaldisasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or othercommunicable diseases or other catastrophic events could reduce customertraffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations,which could materially and adversely affect us.9     Because we source asignificant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas,we are subject to risks associated with international operations, changes,disruptions, cost changes or other problems  affecting the Company’smerchandise supply chain could materially and adversely affect the Company’sbusiness,  results of operations and financial condition.      A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principallyin East Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly importthe remaining merchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise fromforeign sources.  As a result, political, financial or other forms ofinstability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from countriesaffecting our supply chain, increased security requirements for importedmerchandise, or the imposition of additional regulations or changes in duties,quotas, tariffs, taxes or other factors affecting the availability or cost ofimports, could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of ourmerchandise or increase our costs. Our costs are also affected by currencyfluctuations. Any changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreigncurrencies may increase our cost of goods sold. Any of these factors could havea material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, increased energy and transportationcosts have caused us significant cost increases from time to time, and futureadverse changes in these costs or the disruption of the means by whichmerchandise is transported to us could cause additional cost increases orinterruptions of our supply chain which could be significant. Further, we aresubject to increased costs or potential disruptions impacting any port or traderoute through which our products move. If we are forced to source merchandisefrom other countries or other domestic vendors with foreign sources indifferent countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different orinferior quality from the ones we now sell.   The inability of third-partyvendors to produce goods on time and to the Company’s specification may adverselyaffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on third-party vendors to manufactureand supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that our vendors willfail to perform as we expect.  For example, the deterioration in any of our keyvendors’ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandise in a timelymanner that meets our specifications, or other failures to follow our vendorguidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, including compliantlabor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us tooperational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks.  If we are notable to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source withmerchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect,our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.  Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the UnitedStates further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations andcompliance risks, as discussed below under “Our business operations subject usto legal compliance and litigation risks that could result in increased costsor liabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.” The operation of oursourcing offices in Asia may present increased legal and operational risks.       In October 2014, weestablished our own sourcing offices. Our experience with legal and regulatorypractices and requirements in Asia is limited. If our sourcing offices areunable to successfully oversee merchandise production to ensure that product isproduced on time and within the Company’s specifications,our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operations and financialcondition could be materially and adversely affected. Further, the activitiesconducted by our sourcing office outside the United States further subject usto foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. and international regulations andcompliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors
” section, inparticular below under “Our business operations subject us to legal complianceand litigation risks that could result in increased costs or liabilities,divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.”10     Fluctuations in the price,availability and quality of inventory may result in higher cost of goods, whichthe Company may not be able to pass on to the customers.       Vendors are increasinglypassing on higher production costs, which may impact our ability to maintain orgrow our margins. The price and availability of raw materials may be impactedby demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, as well as other factors. Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue to have increases in othermanufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. Theseincreases in production costs result in higher merchandise costs to theCompany. Due to the Company’s limited flexibility in price point, the Companymay not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer, which couldhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financialcondition.  Anyactual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive consumerconfidence and spending may materially and adversely affect consumer demand forour apparel and accessories and our results of operations.       Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel andaccessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economicconditions and uncertainties, political conditions and uncertainties (such asthose currently being debated in the U.S. regarding budgetary, spending and taxpolicies), levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wagerates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth,the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptionsof adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Anyperception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trendnegatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spendinghabits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding themalso generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, suchas our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, allof which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations.  Inaddition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual economicconditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism,political unrest or natural disasters, or similar events, may also dampenconsumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending.  Anyof these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.         A failure or disruption relating to ourinformation technology systems could adversely affect our business.      We rely on ourexisting information technology systems for merchandise operations, includingmerchandise planning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and productlife cycle management.  In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize ourinformation technology systems for our distribution processes, as well as ourfinancial systems, including accounts payable, general ledger, accountsreceivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets.  Despite theprecautions we take, our information systems may be vulnerable to disruption orfailure from numerous events, including but not limited to, natural disasters,severe weather conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber attacks,acts of war or terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyondour control or that we fail to anticipate. Any disruption in or failure in theoperation of our information technology systems, or our failure to continue toupgrade or improve such systems could adversely affect our business. Modificationsand/or upgrades to our current information technology systems may also disruptour operations. 11     A disruption or shutdown ofour centralized distribution center or transportation network could materiallyand adversely affect our business and results of operations.      The distribution of ourproducts is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolinaand distributed through our network of third-party freight carriers.  Themerchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, whereit is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequentlydelivered to the stores by our third-party freight carriers.  If thedistribution center or our third-party freight carriers were to be shutdown orlose significant capacity for any reason, including but not limited to, any ofthe causes described under “A failure or disruption relating to our informationtechnology systems could adversely affect our business,” our operations wouldlikely be seriously disrupted.  Such problems could occur as the result of anyloss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our distribution center,as well as any broader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goodsinto our distribution center or deliver goods to our stores.  As a result, wecould incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated withdistributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us toreopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network.Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operationsand financial condition. Our ability to attractconsumers and grow our revenues is dependent on the success of our storelocation strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned.      Our sales are dependent inpart on the location of our stores in shopping centers where we believe ourconsumers and potential consumers shop.  In addition, our ability to grow ourrevenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space forand open new stores in attractive locations.  Centers where we currentlyoperate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adversely affectedby, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularlyaffecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores,changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shoppingpreferences.  To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shoppingpreferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores indesirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense.A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where wegenerally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centersand locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, couldadversely affect consumer traffic and reduce our sales and net earnings orincrease our operating costs.      Our ability to open and operatenew stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to identify suitablestore locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, and hire and trainappropriate store personnel.  In addition, our continued expansion into newregions of the country where we have not done business before may present newchallenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as we enter these newmarkets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute our plans for openingnew stores or the failure of these stores to perform up to our expectationscould adversely affect our business, results of operations and financialcondition.      If the Company is unable tosuccessfully integrate new businesses into its existing business,  theCompany’s financial condition and results of operations will be adverselyaffected.      TheCompany’s long-term business strategy includes growth through the developmentof new store concepts. This growth may require significant capital expendituresand management attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipatedbenefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipatedamounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costs relatedto our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our stores are notsuccessful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. If wecannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial condition andresults of operations may be adversely impacted.  12    A security breach that results in unauthorizeddisclosure of Company, employee or customer information could adversely affectour costs, reputation and results of operations.  The protection of employee,company and customer data is critical to the Company. Any security breach,mishandling, human or programming error or other event that results in themisappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of employee, company orcustomer information, including but not limited to credit card data or otherpersonally identifiable information, could severely damage the Company'sreputation, expose it to the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt its operationsand otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition.Despite measures the Company has taken to protect confidential information,there is no assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of suchinformation. If any such compromise or unauthorized disclosure of thisinformation were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on theCompany's reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cashflows. TheCompany’s failure to successfully operate its e-commerce website or fulfillcustomer expectations could adversely impact customer satisfaction, ourreputation and our business.            Althoughthe Company's e-commerce platform provides another channel to drive incrementalsales, provide existing customers the on-line shopping experience and introducethe Company to a new customer base, it also exposes us to numerous risks. Weare subject to potential failures in the efficient and uninterrupted operationof our website, customer contact center or our distribution center, includingsystem failures caused by telecommunication system providers, order volumesthat exceed our present system capabilities, electrical outages, mechanicalproblems and human error.  Our e-commerce platform may also expose us togreater potential for security or data breaches involving the unauthorizeddisclosure of customer information, as discussed above under “A security breachthat results in unauthorized disclosure of Company, employee or customerinformation could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results ofoperations.” We are also subject to risk related to delays or failures in theperformance of third parties, such as shipping companies, including delaysassociated with labor strikes or slowdowns or adverse weather conditions. Ifthe Company does not successfully meet the challenges of operating ane-commerce website or fulfilling customer expectations, the Company's businessand sales could be adversely affected. Failure to attract, train,and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and ourfinancial condition.      Likemost retailers, we experience significant associate turnover rates,particularly among store sales associates and managers.  Because our continuedstore growth will require the hiring and training of new associates, we mustcontinually attract, hire and train new store associates to meet our staffingneeds. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our store salesassociates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs, aswell as possibly cause a decrease in our store operating efficiency andproductivity.  We compete for qualified store associates, as well asexperienced management personnel, with other companies in our industry or otherindustries, many of whom have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, we depend on keymanagement personnel to oversee the operational divisions of the Company forthe support of our existing business and future expansion. The success ofexecuting our business strategy depends in large part on retaining keymanagement. We compete for key management personnel with other retailers, andour inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could limit our abilityto continue to grow.      If we are unable to retain ourkey management and store associates or attract, train, or retain other skilledpersonnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customerseffectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect ourbusiness, operating results and financial condition. 13    Ourbusiness operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks thatcould result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management’sattention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.      Our operations are subject tofederal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. andforeign laws and regulations relating to our activities in foreign countriesfrom which we source our merchandise and operate our sourcing offices.  Ourbusiness is also subject to regulatory and litigation risk in all of thesejurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions that may lack well-establishedor reliable legal systems for resolving legal disputes. Compliance risks andlitigation claims have or may arise in the ordinary course of our business andinclude, among other issues, employment issues, commercial disputes,intellectual property issues, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relationsand personal injury claims. International activities subject us to numerousU.S. and international regulations, including but not limited to, restrictionson trade, license and permit requirements, import and export licenserequirements, privacy and data protection laws, environmental laws, records andinformation management regulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws,such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or personsacting on the Company’s behalf may result in significant investigation costsand severe criminal or civil sanctions.  These and other liabilities to whichwe may be subject could negatively affect our business, operating results andfinancial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legalissues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divertsignificant management time.  In addition, governing laws, rules andregulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change fromtime to time.  Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpectedexpenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our operations andour reputation.         Ifwe fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights orinfringe the intellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image,growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition could beadversely affected.      We believe that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’s Fashion Metro” and“Versona” trademarks are integral to our store designs, brand recognition andour ability to successfully build consumer loyalty. Although we have registeredthese trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and havealso registered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with thePTO that we believe are important to our business, we cannot assure that theseregistrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts,store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our otherintellectual property rights by others. Infringement of our names, concepts,store designs or merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner that projectslesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our image could adverselyaffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.      In addition, wecannot assure that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our privatelabel merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks orother proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subjectto lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannotpredict; however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations. We may experience marketconditions that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and ourability to access, our short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.      Ourshort-term investments and cash equivalents are primarily comprised ofinvestments in federal, state, municipal and corporate debt securities.  Thevalue of those securities may be impacted by factors beyond our control, suchas changes to credit ratings, rates of default, collateral value, discountrates, and strength and quality of market credit and liquidity.  As federal,state and municipal entities struggle with declining tax revenues and budgetdeficits, we cannot be assured of our ability to timely access these investments if the market for these issues declines.  Similarly, the default by issuers could adversely affect our financialcondition, results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy.In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents atfinancial institutions that are in excess of the federally insuredlimits.   An economic downturn or development of adverse conditionsaffecting the financial sector and stability of financial institutions couldcause us to experience losses on our deposits.14     Maintaining and improving ourinternal control over financial reporting and other requirements necessary tooperate as a public company may strain our resources, and any material failurein these controls may negatively impact our business, the price of our commonstock and market confidence in our reported financial information.      As a public company, we aresubject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York StockExchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and ConsumerProtection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and related rule-making that has been andwill continue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandatesof the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have,and may continue to, increase our compliance costs and place significant strainon our personnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the SEC’s rulesimplementing the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,we must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal controlover financial reporting, which is a costly and time-consuming effort that mustbe re-evaluated frequently. We cannot give assurance that our disclosurecontrols and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, asdefined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate in the future. Anyfailure to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financialreporting or to comply with the other various laws and regulations to which weare and will continue to be subject, or to which we may become subject in thefuture, as a public company could have an adverse material impact on ourbusiness, our financial condition and the price of our common stock. Inaddition, our efforts to comply with these requirements, particularly with newrequirements under the Dodd-Frank Act that have yet to be implemented, could significantlyincrease our compliance costs.         Changes to accounting rules and regulations mayadversely affect our reported results of operations and         financialcondition.      In an effort to providegreater comparability of financial reporting in an increasing globalenvironment, accounting regulatory authorities are entering into collaborativeefforts to converge U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards. These changes in accounting rules or regulationsmay significantly impact our future reported results of operations andfinancial position.  Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varyinginterpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have significantlyaffected our reported financial statements and those of other participants inthe retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future.       Proposed changes to lease accounting standards mayrequire lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financial statements inthe future. If adopted, this change will have a major impact on the Company asa retailer with numerous leased locations. Such a change would require Cato torecord a significant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities on ourbalance sheet and make other changes to the recording and classification oflease-related expenses on our statements of income and cash flows. This changecould lead to the perception by investors that we are highly leveraged andwould change the calculation of numerous financial metrics and measures of ourperformance and financial condition. This and other future changes toaccounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported results ofoperations and financial position.   Government enacted healthcare reform could adversely affect our business and results of operations.       In March 2010, United States government enacted healthcare reform legislation, known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This legislation andrelated guidance expands the Company’s responsibility for providing employeeswith insurance coverage that meets minimum eligibility and coveragerequirements or face, alternatively, beginning in 2015, penalties for failureto offer this coverage.  The legislation also includes provisions that willimpact the number of individuals with insurance coverage, the types of coverageand level of health benefits that will be required and the amount of payment providersperforming health care services will receive. The full effect of thislegislation is expected to continue to be phased in over several years, andcould increase healthcare expenses for the Company and have an adverse effecton the Company's results of operations. The Company is still assessing itspotential impact on healthcare expenses. However, to the extent we are requiredto provide health insurance benefits to our employees that are more extensivethan the health insurance benefits we currently provide and to a potentiallylarger proportion of our employees, or pay penalties if we elect not to providethese benefits, our expenses will increase. If we are unable to offset thesecost increases by raising our prices or cutting other costs, such increasedexpenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.15     Risks Relating To TheMarket Value Of Our Common Stock:         Our operating results are subject to seasonaland quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the         market priceof our common stock.       Our business varies withgeneral seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail apparelindustry.  As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentage ofour annual net sales and profitability in the first and second quarters of ourfiscal year compared to other quarters.  Accordingly, our operating results forany one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expectedfrom any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations couldadversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of a principalshareholder may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence thedirection of the Company.       As of March 24, 2015, John P.D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficiallycontrolled approximately 41% of the voting power of our common stock.  As aresult, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantly influencesubstantially all matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including theelection of directors and the approval of mergers and other businesscombinations or other significant Company transactions.  Mr. Cato may haveinterests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in a waywith which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to theirinterests.  In addition, the concentration of voting power held by Mr. Catocould have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change incontrol of the Company, which could depress the market price of our commonstock.   Conditions in the stockmarket generally, or particularly relating to our Company or common stock, maymaterially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and makeits trading price more volatile.       The trading price of ourcommon stock at times has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject tosignificant volatility.  A variety of factors may cause the price ofthe common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, but notlimited to, those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as the following:low trading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from factors notdirectly related to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock;announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in ourreported operating results; general conditions in the fashion and retailindustry; conditions affecting or perceived to affect the domestic or globaleconomy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in financialestimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securities analysts;negative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding short-sellingmarket behavior; adverse customer relations developments; significant changesin our senior management team; and legalproceedings.   Over the past several years the stock market ingeneral, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers inparticular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times beenunrelated to the operating performance of those companies.  Suchfluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors maymaterially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.16     "
1,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2014-04-02,">Item 1A.     Risk Factors
:       An investment in ourcommon stock involves numerous types of risks.  You should carefullyconsider the following risk factors, in addition to the other informationcontained in this report, including the disclosures under â€œForward-lookingInformationâ€ above in evaluating our Company and any potential investment in ourcommon stock.  If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur, ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be materially andadversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and youcould lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock.  The risksand uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones facingus.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or thatwe currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect ourbusiness operating results and financial condition. Risks Relating To Our Business: If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond torapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, ourbusiness and results of operations could materially suffer.       Customer tastes and fashiontrends, particularly for womenâ€™s apparel, are volatile, tend to change rapidlyand cannot be predicted with certainty.  Our success depends in part uponour ability to consistently anticipate and respond to changing merchandisetrends and consumer preferences in a timely manner.  Accordingly, anyfailure by us to anticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trendscould adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turncould adversely affect our business and our image with our customers.  Ifwe miscalculate either the market for our merchandise or our customersâ€™ tastesor purchasing habits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsoldinventory at below average markups over cost, or below cost, which wouldadversely affect our margins and results of operations.      Existing and increasedcompetition in the womenâ€™s retail apparel industry may negatively impact ourbusiness,     results of operations, financial condition andmarket share.      The womenâ€™s retail apparelindustry is highly competitive.  We compete primarily with discountstores, mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialtystores and internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greaterfinancial, marketing and other resources than we have.  Many of ourcompetitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their sellingprices.   In some cases our competitors are expanding into markets inwhich we have a significant market presence.  As a result of thiscompetition, including close-out sales and going-out-of-business sales by otherwomenâ€™s apparel retailers, we may experience pricing pressures, increasedmarketing expenditures, as well as loss of market share, which could materiallyand adversely affect our business, results of operations and financialcondition.         8   Unusual weather, natural disasters or similar events mayadversely affect our sales or operations.      Extreme changes in weather,natural disasters or similar events can influence customer trends and shoppinghabits.  For example, heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditionsover a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel toour stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability.  Our business isalso susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions.  For example, extendedperiods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or coolweather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventoryincompatible with those unseasonable conditions.  Reduced sales fromextreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions would adversely affect ourbusiness.  The occurrence or threat of extreme weather, natural disasters,power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or other communicable diseasesor other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our stores andlikewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations, which could materially andadversely affect us. Because we source a significant portion of ourmerchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risksassociated with international operations, and changes, disruptions, cost changesor other problems  affecting the Companyâ€™s merchandise supply chain couldmaterially and adversely affect the Companyâ€™s business,  results ofoperations and financial condition.       A significant amount ofour merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in East Asia. We directlyimport some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remaining merchandisefrom domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreign sources.  Asa result, political, financial or other forms of instability or other eventsresulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting our supply chain,increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or the imposition ofadditional regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or otherfactors affecting the availability or cost of imports, could cause significantdelays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs.Our costs are also affected by currency fluctuations. Any changes in the valueof the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goodssold. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.  In addition, increased energy and transportation costs havecaused us significant cost increases, and continued increases in these costs orthe disruption of the means by which merchandise is transported to us couldcause additional cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain which couldbe significant. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries orother domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, those goodsmay be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones we nowsell.  Furthermore, our dependence on third party vendors to manufactureand supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that our vendors willfail to perform as we expect.  For example, the deterioration in any of ourkey vendorsâ€™ financial condition, their failure to ship merchandise in a timelymanner that meets our specifications, or other failures to follow our vendorguidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, including compliantlabor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us tooperational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks.  If we arenot able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently sourcewith merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as weexpect, our business, results of operations and financial condition could beadversely affected.  Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outsidethe United States further subject us to numerous U.S. and internationalregulations and compliance risks, as discussed below under â€œOur businessoperations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks that could resultin increased costs or liabilities, divert our managementâ€™s attention orotherwise adversely affect our business.â€ Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality ofinventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be ableto pass on to the customers.       Vendors are increasinglypassing on higher production costs, which may impact our ability to maintain orgrow our margins. The price and availability of raw materials may be impacted bydemand, regulation, weather and crop yields, as well as other factors. Additionally, manufacturers are experiencing increases in other manufacturingcosts, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases in production costs result in highermerchandise costs to the Company. Due to the Companyâ€™s limited flexibility inprice point, the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to theconsumer, which could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition.9     Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditionsthat drive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affectconsumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results ofoperations.       Consumer spending habits, including spending for ourapparel and accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailingeconomic conditions and uncertainties, political conditions and uncertainties(such as those currently being debated in the U.S. regarding budgetary, spendingand tax policies), levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salariesand wage rates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer networth, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumerperceptions of adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions.Any perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trendnegatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spendinghabits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding themalso generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, suchas our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, allof which may also adversely affect our net sales and results ofoperations.  In addition, numerous events, whether or not related to actualeconomic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war orterrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, or similar events, may alsodampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumerspending.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.        A failure ordisruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affectour business.       We rely on our existinginformation technology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandiseplanning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cyclemanagement.  In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize ourinformation technology systems for our distribution processes, as well as ourfinancial systems, including accounts payable, general ledger, accountsreceivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets.  Any disruption inthe operation of our information technology systems, or our failure to continueto upgrade or improve such systems could adversely affect our business.Modifications and/or upgrades to our current information technology systems mayalso disrupt our operations.   A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distributioncenter or transportation network could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness and results of operations.      The distribution of ourproducts is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolinaand distributed through our network of third party freight carriers.  Themerchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, where itis prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered tothe stores by our third party freight carriers.  If the distribution centeror our third party freight carriers were to be shutdown or lose significantcapacity for any reason, our operations would likely be seriouslydisrupted.  Such problems could occur as the result of any loss,destruction or impairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as wellas any broader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into ourdistribution center or deliver goods to our stores.  As a result, we couldincur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated withdistributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us toreopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network. Anysuch occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.   10   Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues isdependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability tosuccessfully open new stores as planned.      Our sales are dependent inpart on the location of our stores in shopping centers where we believe ourconsumers and potential consumers shop.  In addition, our ability to growour revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space forand open new stores in attractive locations.  Centers where we currentlyoperate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adversely affected by,among other things, general economic downturns or those particularly affectingthe commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores, changes intenant mix and changes in customer shopping preferences.  To takeadvantage of consumer traffic and the shopping preferences of our consumers, weneed to maintain and acquire stores in desirable locations where competition forsuitable store locations is intense. A decline in customer popularity of thestrip shopping centers where we generally locate our stores or in availabilityof space in desirable centers and locations, or an increase in the cost of suchdesired space, could adversely affect consumer traffic and reduce our sales andnet earnings or increase our operating costs.      Our ability to open andoperate new stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond ourcontrol.  These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability toidentify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, and hireand train appropriate store personnel.  In addition, our continuedexpansion into new regions of the country where we have not done business beforemay present new challenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as weenter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute ourplans for opening new stores or the failure of these stores to perform up to ourexpectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.       The Companyâ€™s ability to successfully integrate newbusinesses into its existing business, to the extent it enters new lines ofbusiness in the future, will affect the Companyâ€™s financial condition andresults of operations.      The Companyâ€™s long-termbusiness strategy includes growth through the development of new store concepts.This growth may require significant capital expenditures and managementattention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of a newbusiness and integration costs may exceed anticipated amounts. We have incurredsubstantial financial commitments and fixed costs related to our retail storesthat we will not be able to recover if our stores are not successful and thatcould potentially result in impairment charges. If we cannot successfullyexecute our growth strategies, our financial condition and results of operationsmay be adversely impacted.  A security breach that results in unauthorized disclosureof Company, employee or customer information could adversely affect our resultsof operations.  The protection of customer, employee, and company data iscritical to the Company. Any security breach involving the misappropriation,loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer, employee orcompany information could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it tothe risks of legal proceedings, disrupt its operations and otherwise adverselyaffect the Company's business and financial condition. Despite measures theCompany has taken to protect confidential information, there is no assurancethat such measures will prevent the compromise of customer transactionprocessing capabilities and personal data. If any such compromise of theCompany's information security were to occur, it could have a material adverseeffect on the Company's reputation, business, operating results, financialcondition and cash flows. The Companyâ€™s failure to successfully operate itse-commerce website or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impactcustomer satisfaction, our reputation and our business.             Although the Company'se-commerce platform provides another channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers the on-line shoppingexperience and introduce the Company to a new customer base, it also exposes usto numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures in the efficient anduninterrupted operation of our website, customer contact center or ourdistribution center, including system failures caused by telecommunicationsystem providers, order volumes that exceed our present system capabilities,electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error.  Our e-commerceplatform may also expose us to greater potential for security or data breachesinvolving the unauthorized disclosure of customer information, as discussed[above] under â€œA security breach that results in unauthorized disclosure ofCompany, employee or customer information could adversely affect our results ofoperations.â€ We are also subject to risk related to delays or failures in theperformance of third parties, such as shipping companies, including delaysassociated with labor strikes or slowdowns or adverse weather conditions. If theCompany does not successfully meet the challenges of operating an e-commercewebsite or fulfilling customer expectations, the Company's business and salescould be adversely affected.11    Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnelcould adversely affect our business and our financialcondition.      Like most retailers, weexperience significant associate turnover rates, particularly among store salesassociates and managers.  Because our continued store growth will requirethe hiring and training of new associates, we must continually attract, hire andtrain new store associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase inthe turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increaseour recruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in ourstore operating efficiency and productivity.  We compete for qualifiedstore associates, as well as experienced management personnel, with othercompanies in our industry or other industries, many of whom have greaterfinancial resources than we do. In addition, we depend on key management personnel tooversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of our existingbusiness and future expansion. The success of executing our business strategydepends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for key managementpersonnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract and retainqualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.      If we are unable to retainour key management and store associates or attract, train, or retain otherskilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customerseffectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect ourbusiness, results, and financial condition.        Our businessoperations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks that could resultin increased            costsor liabilities, divert our managementâ€™s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business.      Our operations are subjectto federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. andforeign laws and regulations relating to our activities in foreign countriesfrom which we source our merchandise.  Our business is also subject tolitigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictionsthat may lack well-established or reliable legal systems for resolving legaldisputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have or may arise in theordinary course of our business and include, among other issues, employmentissues, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues, product-orientedmatters, tax, customer relations and personal injury claims. Internationalactivities subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations, includingbut not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements,import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws,environmental laws, records and information management regulations, tariffs andtaxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,violations of which by persons acting on the Companyâ€™s behalf may result insignificant investigation costs and severe criminal or civil sanctions. These and other liabilities to which we may be subject could negatively affectour business, operating results and financial condition. These mattersfrequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and coulddivert significant management time.  In addition, governing laws, rules andregulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change fromtime to time.  Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpectedexpenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our operations andour reputation.12           If we fail toprotect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or infringe theintellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image, growthstrategy, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.       We believe that our â€œCatoâ€, â€œItâ€™s Fashionâ€, â€œItâ€™s FashionMetroâ€ and â€œVersonaâ€ trademarks are integral to our store designs, brandrecognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty. Although wehave registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office(â€œPTOâ€) and have also registered, or applied for registration of, additionaltrademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to our business, we cannotassure that these registrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks,merchandising concepts, store designs or private label merchandise or theinfringement of our other intellectual property rights by others. Infringementof our names, concepts, store designs or merchandise generally, or particularlyin a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation ofour image could adversely affect our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.       In addition, we cannotassure that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our privatelabel merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks orother proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subjectto lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannotpredict; however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations. We may experience market conditions that could adverselyimpact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, our short-terminvestments and cash and cash equivalents.      Our short-term investmentsand cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state,municipal and corporate debt securities.  The value of those securities maybe impacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes to credit ratings,rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality ofmarket credit and liquidity.  As federal, state and municipal entitiesstruggle with declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assuredof our ability to timely access these investments if the market for these issuesdeclines.   Similarly, the default by issuers could adversely affectour financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute ourbusiness strategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cashequivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of the federallyinsured limits.   An economic downturn or development of adverseconditions affecting the financial sector and stability of financialinstitutions could cause us to experience losses on our deposits. Maintaining and improving our internal control overfinancial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a publiccompany may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controls maynegatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and marketconfidence in our reported financial information.      As a public company, we aresubject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York Stock Exchangeand certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer ProtectionAct (the â€œDodd-Frank Actâ€) and related rule-making that has been and willcontinue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandates of theDodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have, and maycontinue to, increase our compliance costs and place significant strain on ourpersonnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the SECâ€™s rules implementing therequirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continueto document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly and time-consumingeffort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot give assurance thatour disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financialreporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate in thefuture. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal control overfinancial reporting or to comply with the other various laws and regulations towhich we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we may become subjectin the future, as a public company could have an adverse material impact on ourbusiness, our financial condition and the price of our common stock. Inaddition, our efforts to comply with these requirements, particularly with newrequirements under the Dodd-Frank Act that have yet to be implemented, couldsignificantly increase our compliance costs.13           Changes toaccounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported results ofoperations and financial condition.      In an effort to providegreater comparability of financial reporting in an increasing globalenvironment, accounting regulatory authorities are entering into collaborativeefforts to converge U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles withInternational Financial Reporting Standards. These changes in accounting rulesor regulations may significantly impact our future reported results ofoperations and financial position.  Changes in accounting rules orregulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules andregulations have significantly affected our reported financial statements andthose of other participants in the retail industry in the past and may continueto do so in the future.       Proposed changes to leaseaccounting standards may require lessees to capitalize operating leases in theirfinancial statements in the future. If adopted, this change will have a majorimpact on the Company as a retailer with numerous leased locations. Such achange would require Cato to record a significant amount of lease-related assetsand liabilities on our balance sheet and make other changes to the recording andclassification of lease-related expenses on our statements of income and cashflows. This change could lead to the perception by investors that we are highlyleveraged and would change the calculation of numerous financial metrics andmeasures of our performance and financial condition. This and other futurechanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reportedresults of operations and financial position.   Government enacted health care reform could adverselyaffect our business and results of operations.       In March 2010, UnitedStates government enacted healthcare reform legislation, known as the PatientProtection and Affordable Care Act. This legislation and related guidanceexpands the Companyâ€™s responsibility for providing employees with insurancecoverage that meets minimum eligibility and coverage requirements or face,alternatively, beginning in 2015, penalties for failure to offer thiscoverage.  The legislation also includes provisions that will impact thenumber of individuals with insurance coverage, the types of coverage and levelof health benefits that will be required and the amount of payment providersperforming health care services will receive. This legislation is expected totake effect being phased in over several years, and could increase healthcareexpenses for the Company and have an adverse effect on the Company's results ofoperations. The Company is still assessing its potential impact on healthcareexpenses. However, to the extent we are required to provide health insurancebenefits to our employees that are more extensive than the health insurancebenefits we currently provide and to a potentially larger proportion of ouremployees, or pay penalties if we elect not to provide these benefits, ourexpenses will increase. If we are unable to offset these cost increases byraising our prices or cutting other costs, such increased expenses couldmaterially and adversely affect our results of operations.      14   Risks Relating To The Market Value Of Our CommonStock:        Our operating results are subject to seasonal andquarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the          market price of ourcommon stock.       Our business varies withgeneral seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail apparelindustry.  As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentageof our annual net sales and profitability in the first and second quarters ofour fiscal year compared to other quarters.  Accordingly, our operatingresults for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results tobe expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuationscould adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of a principal shareholder may limit theability of other shareholders to influence the direction of theCompany.       As of April 2, 2014, JohnP. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficiallycontrolled approximately 39% of the voting power of our common stock.  As aresult, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantly influence substantiallyall matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including the election ofdirectors and the approval of mergers and other business combinations.  Mr.Cato may have interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and mayvote in a way with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse totheir interests.  In addition, the concentration of voting power held byMr. Cato could have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a changein control of the Company, which could depress the market price of our commonstock.   Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularlyrelating to our Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affect themarket price of our common stock and make its trading price morevolatile.       The trading price of ourcommon stock at times has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject tosignificant volatility.  A variety of factors may cause the price ofthe common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, but not limitedto, those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as the following: lowtrading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from factors not directlyrelated to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock;announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in ourreported operating results; general conditions in the fashion and retailindustry; conditions affecting or perceived to affect the domestic or globaleconomy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes infinancial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securitiesanalysts; negative commentary regarding our Company and correspondingshort-selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments;significant changes in our senior management team; and legalproceedings.   Over the past several years the stock market ingeneral, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers inparticular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times beenunrelated to the operating performance of those companies.  Suchfluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors maymaterially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. "
2,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2013-04-02,">Item 1A.     RiskFactors:       An investment in our commonstock involves numerous types of risks.  You should carefully consider thefollowing risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in thisreport, including the disclosures under “Forward-looking Information” above inevaluating our Company and any potential investment in our common stock.  Ifany of the following risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financialcondition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, thetrading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or apart of your investment in our common stock.  The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed in this section are not the only ones facing us.  Additional risksand uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deemimmaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operatingresults and financial condition. Risks Relating To OurBusiness: If we are unable to anticipate,identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands ina timely manner, our business and results of operations could materiallysuffer.       Customer tastes and fashiontrends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile, tend to change rapidlyand cannot be predicted with certainty.  Our success depends in part upon ourability to consistently anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trendsand consumer preferences in a timely manner.  Accordingly, any failure by us toanticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trends could adverselyaffect consumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turn could adverselyaffect our business and our image with our customers.  If we miscalculateeither the market for our merchandise or our customers’ tastes or purchasinghabits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory atbelow average markups over cost, or below cost, which would adversely affectour margins and results of operations.      Existing and increased competition in the women’sretail apparel industry may negatively impact our business,                resultsof operations, financial condition and market share.      Thewomen’s retail apparel industry is highly competitive.  We competeprimarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers, department stores,off-price retailers, specialty stores, and internet-based retailers, many ofwhich have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources thanwe have.  Many of our competitors offer frequent promotions andreduce their selling prices.   In some cases our competitors are expanding intomarkets in which we have a significant market presence.  As a resultof this competition, including close-out sales and going-out-of-business sales byother women’s apparel retailers, we may experience pricing pressures, increasedmarketing expenditures, as well as loss of market share, which could materiallyand adversely affect our business, results of operations and financialcondition.       Unusual weather, naturaldisasters or similar events may adversely affect our sales or operations.      Extreme changes in weather,natural disasters or similar events can influence customer trends and shopping habits.  For example, heavy rainfall or other extremeweather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for ourcustomers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales andprofitability.  Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weatherconditions.  For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperaturesduring the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could rendera portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions wouldadversely affect our business.  The occurrence or threat of extreme weather,natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or othercommunicable diseases or other catastrophic events could reduce customertraffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations,which could materially and adversely affect us.    Because we source asignificant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas,we are subject to risks associated with international operations, and changes,disruptions, cost changes or other problems  affecting the Company’smerchandise supply chain could materially and adversely affect the Company’sbusiness,  results of operations and financial condition.      A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principallyin East Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly importthe remaining merchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandisefrom foreign sources.  As a result, political, financial or other forms ofinstability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from countriesaffecting our supply chain, increased security requirements for importedmerchandise, or the imposition of additional regulations or changes in duties,quotas, tariffs, taxes or other factors affecting the availability or cost ofimports, could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of ourmerchandise or increase our costs. Our costs are also affected by currency fluctuations.Any changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies mayincrease our cost of goods sold. Any of these factors could have a materialadverse effect on our business.  In addition, increased energy andtransportation costs have caused us significant cost increases, and continuedincreases in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise istransported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of oursupply chain which could be significant. If we are forced to source merchandisefrom other countries or other domestic vendors with foreign sources indifferent countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different orinferior quality from the ones we now sell.  Furthermore, our dependence onthird party vendors to manufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us tonumerous risks that our vendors will fail to perform as we expect.  Forexample, the deterioration in any of our key vendors’ financial condition,their failure to ship merchandise in a timely manner that meets ourspecifications, or other failures to follow our vendor guidelines or complywith applicable laws and regulations, including compliant labor andenvironmental practices, could expose us to operational, quality, competitive,reputational and legal risks.  If we are not able to timely or adequatelyreplace the merchandise we currently source with merchandise producedelsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect, our business,results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the United States further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations and compliancerisks, as discussed below under “Our business operations subject us to legalcompliance and litigation risks that could result in increased costs orliabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business.” Fluctuations in the price,availability and quality of inventory may result in higher cost of goods, whichthe Company may not be able to pass on to the customers.       Vendors are increasinglypassing on higher production costs, which may impact our ability to maintain orgrow our margins. The price and availability of raw materials may be impactedby demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, as well as other factors. Additionally, manufacturers are experiencing increases in other manufacturingcosts, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases inproduction costs result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. Due to theCompany’s limited flexibility in price point, the Company may not be able topass on those cost increases to the consumer, which could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.     Anyactual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive consumerconfidence and spending may materially and adversely affect consumer demand forour apparel and accessories and our results of operations.       Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel andaccessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economicconditions and uncertainties, political conditions and uncertainties (such asthose currently being debated in the U.S. regarding budgetary, spending and taxpolicies), levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wagerates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth,the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumerperceptions of adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions.Any perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trendnegatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spendinghabits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding themalso generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, suchas our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, allof which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations.  Inaddition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual economicconditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism,political unrest or natural disasters, or similar events, may also dampenconsumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending.  Anyof these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.         The failure, disruption or security breachrelating to our information technology systems could adversely        affectour business.      We rely on ourexisting information technology systems for merchandise operations, includingmerchandise planning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and productlife cycle management.  In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize ourinformation technology systems for our distribution processes, as well as ourfinancial systems, including accounts payable, general ledger, accountsreceivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets.  Any disruption in theoperation of our information technology systems, or our failure to continue toupgrade or improve such systems could adversely affect our business. Modificationsand/or upgrades to our current information technology systems may also disruptour operations. In addition, any security breach or other problem thatresults in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information,such as personally identifiable information and payment information, or otherconfidential information regarding our associates, vendors or other thirdparties with whom we do business, could adversely affect our standing withthese constituents and expose us to the risk of litigation and liability. Anysuch occurrences could result in reputational damage or loss of business orgoodwill and could adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. A disruption or shutdown ofour centralized distribution center or transportation network could materiallyand adversely affect our business and results of operations.      The distribution of ourproducts is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through our network of third party freight carriers.  Themerchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, whereit is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequentlydelivered to the stores by our third party freight carriers.  If thedistribution center or our third party freight carriers were to be shutdown orlose significant capacity for any reason, our operations would likely beseriously disrupted.  Such problems could occur as the result of any loss,destruction or impairment of our ability to use our distribution center, aswell as any broader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods intoour distribution center or deliver goods to our stores.  As a result, we couldincur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated withdistributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us toreopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network.Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.    Our ability to attractconsumers and grow our revenues is dependent on the success of our storelocation strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned.      Our sales are dependent inpart on the location of our stores in shopping centers where we believe ourconsumers and potential consumers shop.  In addition, our ability to grow ourrevenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space forand open new stores in attractive locations.  Centers where we currentlyoperate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adversely affectedby, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularlyaffecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores,changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shoppingpreferences.  To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shoppingpreferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores indesirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense.A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where wegenerally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centersand locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, couldadversely affect consumer traffic and reduce our sales and net earnings orincrease our operating costs.      Our ability to open andoperate new stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond ourcontrol.  These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability toidentify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, and hireand train appropriate store personnel.  In addition, our continued expansioninto new regions of the country where we have not done business before maypresent new challenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as weenter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute ourplans for opening new stores or the failure of these stores to perform up toour expectations, could adversely affect our business, results of operationsand financial condition. Failure to attract, train,and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and ourfinancial condition.      Likemost retailers, we experience significant associate turnover rates,particularly among store sales associates and managers.  Because our continued store growthwill require the hiring and training of new associates, we must continuallyattract, hire and train new store associates to meet our staffing needs. Asignificant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates andmanagers would increase our recruiting and training costs, as well as possiblycause a decrease in our store operating efficiency and productivity.  Wecompete for qualified store associates, as well as experienced managementpersonnel, with other companies in our industry or other industries, many ofwhom have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, we depend on keymanagement personnel to oversee the operational divisions of the Company forthe support of our existing business and future expansion. The success ofexecuting our business strategy depends in large part on retaining keymanagement. We compete for key management personnel with other retailers, andour inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could limit our abilityto continue to grow.      If we are unable to retain ourkey management and store associates or attract, train, or retain other skilledpersonnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customerseffectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect ourbusiness, results, and financial condition.         Our business operations subject us to legalcompliance and litigation risks that could result in increased         costs orliabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business.      Our operations are subject tofederal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to our activities in foreign countries fromwhich we source our merchandise.  Our business is alsosubject to litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreignjurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems forresolving legal disputes.  Compliance risks and litigation claims have or mayarise in the ordinary course of our business and include, among other issues,employment issues, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues,product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injury claims. International activities subject us to a number of U.S. and internationalregulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license andpermit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and dataprotection laws, environmental laws, records and information managementregulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act, violations of which by persons acting on the Company’sbehalf may result in significant investigation costs and severe criminal orcivil sanctions.  These and other liabilities to which we may be subject couldnegatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which aresubject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significant managementtime.  In addition, governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretationsof existing laws are subject to change from time to time.  Compliance andlitigation matters could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as wellas have an adverse effect on our operations and our reputation.            Ifwe fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights orinfringe the intellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image,growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition could beadversely affected.       Webelieve that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’s Fashion Metro” and “Versona”trademarks are integral to our store designs, brand recognition and our abilityto successfully build consumer loyalty. Although we have registered thesetrademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and have alsoregistered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with the PTOthat we believe are important to our business, we cannot assure that theseregistrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts,store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our otherintellectual property rights by others. Infringement of our names, concepts,store designs or merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner thatprojects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our image couldadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.       In addition, we cannotassure that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our privatelabel merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks orother proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subjectto lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannotpredict; however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations. We may experience marketconditions that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and ourability to access, our short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.      Ourshort-term investments and cash equivalents are primarily comprised ofinvestments in federal, state, municipal and corporate debt securities.  Thevalue of those securities may be impacted by factors beyond our control, suchas changes to credit ratings, rates of default, collateral value, discountrates, and strength and quality of market credit and liquidity.  As federal, stateand municipal entities struggle with declining tax revenues and budgetdeficits, we cannot be assured of our ability to timely access theseinvestments if the market for these issues declines.   Similarly, the defaultby issuers could adversely affect our financial condition, results ofoperations and ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we havesignificant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions thatare in excess of the federally insured limits.   An economic downturnor development of adverse conditions affecting the financial sector andstability of financial institutions could cause us to experience losses on ourdeposits.    Maintainingand improving our internal control over financial reporting and other requirementsnecessary to operate as a public company may strain our resources and anymaterial failure in these controls may negatively impact our business, theprice of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financialinformation.      As a public company, we aresubject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York StockExchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer ProtectionAct (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and related rule-making that has been and willcontinue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandates ofthe Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have, andmay continue to, increase our compliance costs and place significant strain onour personnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the SEC’s rules implementingthe requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we mustcontinue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control overfinancial reporting, which is a costly and time-consuming effort that must bere-evaluated frequently. We cannot give assurance that our disclosurecontrols and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, asdefined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate in the future. Anyfailure to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financialreporting or to comply with the other various laws and regulations to which weare and will continue to be subject, or to which we may become subject in thefuture, as a public company could have an adverse material impact on ourbusiness, our financial condition and the price of our common stock. Inaddition, our efforts to comply with these requirements, particularly with newrequirements under the Dodd-Frank Act that have yet to be implemented, couldsignificantly increase our compliance costs.         Changes to accounting rules and regulations mayadversely affect our reported results of operations and         financial condition.      In an effort to providegreater comparability of financial reporting in an increasing globalenvironment, accounting regulatory authorities are entering into collaborativeefforts to converge U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards. These changes in accounting rules or regulationsmay significantly impact our future reported results of operations andfinancial position.  Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varyinginterpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have significantlyaffected our reported financial statements and those of other participants inthe retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future.       Proposed changes to lease accounting standards mayrequire lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financial statements inthe future. If adopted, this change will have a major impact on the Company asa retailer with numerous leased locations. Such a change would require Cato to recorda significant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities on our balancesheet and make other changes to the recording and classification oflease-related expenses on our statements of income and cash flows. This changecould lead to the perception by investors that we are highly leveraged andwould change the calculation of numerous financial metrics and measures of ourperformance and financial condition. This and other future changes toaccounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported results ofoperations and financial position.         The Company’s ability tosuccessfully integrate new businesses into its existing business, to the extentit enters new lines of business in the future, will affect the Company’sfinancial condition and results of operations.      TheCompany’s long-term business strategy includes growth through the developmentof new store concepts. This growth may require significant capital expendituresand management attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipatedbenefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipatedamounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costsrelated to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our storesare not successful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. Ifwe cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financialcondition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.      A failure of our expansioninto e-commerce operations could significantly disrupt our business and lead toreduced sales, growth prospects and reputational damage.Expandingour operations to incorporate an e-commerce business is an important part ofour growth strategy. Many of our competitors already have e-commerce businessesthat are substantially larger and more developed than ours, which places us ata competitive disadvantage. Our e-commerce operations will be subject tonumerous risks, including rapid changes in technology, website downtime andother technical failures, security breaches, consumer privacy concerns, changesin state tax laws and government regulation of internet activities. Our failureto successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could impact oure-commerce sales, increase our costs, diminish our growth prospects, and damageour brand, which could negatively impact our results of operations andfinancial position.Government enacted healthcare reform could adversely affect our business and results of operations.       In March 2010, the United States government enacted health care reform legislation, known as the PatientProtection and Affordable Care Act. This legislation expands the Company’sresponsibility for providing employees with insurance coverage that meetsminimum eligibility and coverage requirements or, alternatively, beginning in2014, the legislation imposes penalties for failure to offer this coverage. The legislation also includes provisions that will impact the number ofindividuals with insurance coverage, the types of coverage and level of healthbenefits that will be required. The Company is still assessing thelegislation’s potential impact on the Company’s health care expenses.  However,due to the extent we are required to provide health insurance benefits to ouremployees that are more extensive than the health insurance benefits wecurrently provide and to a potentially larger proportion of our employees, orpay penalties if we elect not to provide these benefits, our expenses willincrease. If we are unable to offset these cost increases by raising our pricesor cutting other costs, such increased expenses could materially and adverselyaffect our results of operations.  Risks Relating To OurCommon Stock:         Our operating results are subject to seasonaland quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the         marketprice of our common stock.       Our business varies withgeneral seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail apparelindustry.  As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentage ofour annual net sales and profitability in the first and second quarters of ourfiscal year compared to other quarters.  Accordingly, our operating results forany one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expectedfrom any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations couldadversely affect the market price of our common stock. The interests of a principalshareholder may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence thedirection of the Company.       As of April 2, 2013, John P.D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficiallycontrolled approximately 39% of the voting power of our common stock.  As aresult, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantly influence substantiallyall matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including the election ofdirectors and the approval of mergers and other business combinations.  Mr.Cato may have interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and mayvote in a way with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse totheir interests.  In addition, the concentration of voting power held by Mr.Cato could have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change incontrol of the Company, which could depress the market price of our commonstock.        Conditions in the stockmarket generally, or particularly relating to our Company or common stock, maymaterially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and makeits trading price more volatile.       The trading price of ourcommon stock at times has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject tosignificant volatility.  A variety of factors may cause the price ofthe common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, but notlimited to, those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as the following:low trading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from factors notdirectly related to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock;announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in ourreported operating results; general conditions in the fashion and retailindustry; conditions in the domestic or global economy or the domestic orglobal credit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scopeof coverage given to our Company by securities analysts; negative commentaryregarding our Company and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adversecustomer relations developments; significant changes in our senior managementteam; and legal proceedings.   Over the past several years the stockmarket in general, and the market for shares of equity securities of manyretailers in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that haveat times been unrelated to the operating performance of thosecompanies.  Such fluctuations and market volatility based on these orother factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of ourcommon stock. "
15,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2012-03-27,">Item 1A.     Risk Factors
:       An investment in our commonstock involves numerous types of risks.  You should carefully consider thefollowing risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in thisreport, including the disclosures under “Forward-looking Information” above inevaluating our Company and any potential investment in our common stock.  Ifany of the following risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financialcondition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, thetrading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or apart of your investment in our common stock.  The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed in this section are not the only ones facing us.  Additional risksand uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterialmay also materially and adversely affect our business operating results andfinancial condition. Risks Relating To OurBusiness: If we are unable toanticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends andcustomer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operationscould materially suffer.       Customer tastes and fashiontrends, particularly for women’s apparel, are volatile and tend to changerapidly.  Our success depends in part upon our ability to consistently anticipateand respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timelymanner.  Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify and respond tochanging fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of ourmerchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business and our imagewith our customers.  If we miscalculate either the market for our merchandiseor our customers’ tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell asignificant amount of unsold inventory at below average markups over cost, orbelow cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations.  8        Existing and increasedcompetition in the women’s retail apparel industry may negatively impact ourbusiness,                results of operations, financial condition and marketshare.      Thewomen’s retail apparel industry is highly competitive.  We competeprimarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers, department stores,off-price retailers, specialty stores, and internet-based retailers, many ofwhich have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources thanwe have.  Many of our competitors offer frequent promotions andreduce their selling prices.   In some cases our competitors are expanding intomarkets in which we have a significant market presence.  As a resultof this competition, including close-out sales and going-out-of-business salesby other women’s apparel retailers, we may experience pricing pressures,increased marketing expenditures, as well as loss of market share, which couldmaterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.       Unusual weather, naturaldisasters or similar events may adversely affect our sales or operations.      Extreme changes in weather patternsor natural disasters can influence customer trends and shopping habits.  Forexample, heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolongedperiod might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores andthereby reduce our sales and profitability.  Our business is also susceptibleto unseasonable weather conditions.  For example, extended periods ofunseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather duringthe summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible withthose unseasonable conditions.  Reduced sales from extreme or prolongedunseasonable weather conditions would adversely affect our business.  Theoccurrence or threat of extreme weather patterns, natural disasters, power outages,terrorist acts or other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic inour stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations, which couldmaterially and adversely affect us       We source a significantportion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, and changes,             disruptions, cost changes or other problems  affecting theCompany’s merchandise supply chain could                     materially andadversely affect the Company’s business,  results of operations and financialcondition.       A significant amount of ourmerchandise is manufactured overseas. We directly import some of thismerchandise and indirectly import the remaining merchandise from domesticvendors who acquire the merchandise from foreign sources.  As a result,political instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade fromother countries, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, orthe imposition of additional regulations or changes in duties, quotas, taxes orother factors affecting the availability or cost of imports, could causesignificant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise orincrease our costs.  Any of these factors could have a material adverse effecton our business.  In addition, increased energy and transportation costs havecaused us significant cost increases, and continued increases in these costs orthe disruption of the means by which merchandise is transported to us couldcause us additional cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain whichcould be significant. If we are forced to source merchandise from othercountries or other domestic vendors with foreign sources in differentcountries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different or inferiorquality from the ones we now sell.  Furthermore, our dependence on third partyvendors to manufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risksthat our vendors will fail to perform as we expect.  For example, thedeterioration in any of our key vendors’ financial condition, their failure to shipmerchandise in a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failuresto follow our vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulationscould expose us to operational, quality, competitive, reputational and legalrisks.  If we were not able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise wecurrently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail toperform as we expect, our business, results of operations and financial conditioncould be adversely affected. 9   Fluctuationsin the price, availability and quality of inventory may result in higher costof goods which the Company may not be able to pass on to the customers.       Vendors are increasinglypassing on higher production costs which may impact our ability to maintain orgrow our margins. The price and availability of raw materials may be impactedby demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, as well as other factors. Additionally, manufacturers are experiencing increases in other manufacturingcosts, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases inproduction costs result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. Due to theCompany’s limited flexibility in price point, the Company may not be able topass on those cost increases to the consumer which could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.      Our costs are affected by foreign currencyfluctuations.      Because we purchase asignificant portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers, our cost of thesegoods is affected by the fluctuation of the local currencies where these goodsare produced against the dollar.  Accordingly, changes in the value of thedollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold and,if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers, decrease ourgross margins and ultimately our earnings.  Accordingly, foreign currencyfluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. Acontinuation or worsening of adverse conditions in the general economicenvironment or outlook and its related impact on consumer confidence andspending may materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our appareland accessories and our results of operations.       Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel andaccessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economicconditions, levels of employment, fuel and energy costs, salaries and wagerates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth,the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence or consumerperceptions of economic and political conditions or trends. Any perception thatadverse conditions in the general economy or credit markets are continuing orworsening may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spendinghabits. Adverse economic conditions or uncertainties also generally causeconsumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise,or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, all of which may alsoadversely affect our net sales and results of operations.  In addition,numerous events, whether or not related to actual economic conditions, such asdownturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest ornatural disasters, or similar events, may also dampen consumer confidence, andaccordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending.  Any of these events could havea material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.         The failure, disruption or security breachrelating to our information technology systems could adversely        affectour business.      We rely on ourexisting information technology systems for merchandise operations includingmerchandise planning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and productlife cycle management.  In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize ourinformation technology systems for our distribution processes, as well as ourfinancial systems including accounts payable, general ledger, accountsreceivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets.  Any disruption in theoperation of our information technology systems, or our failure to continue toupgrade or improve such systems could adversely affect our business. Modificationsand/or upgrades to our current information technology systems may also disruptour operations. In addition, any security breach or other problem thatresults in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information,such as personally identifiable information and payment information, or otherconfidential information regarding our associates, vendors or other thirdparties with whom we do business, could adversely affect our standing withthese constituents and expose us to the risk oflitigation and liability. Any such occurrences could result in reputationaldamage or loss of business or goodwill and could adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.10             A disruption or shutdown of our centralizeddistribution center or transportation network could materially    and adverselyaffect our business and results of operations.      The distribution of ourproducts is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through our network of third party freight carriers.  Themerchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, whereit is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequentlydelivered to the stores by our third party freight carriers.  If thedistribution center or our third party freight carriers were to be shutdown orlose significant capacity for any reason, our operations would likely be seriouslydisrupted.  Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction orimpairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as well as anybroader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into ourdistribution center or deliver goods to our stores.  As a result, we couldincur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated withdistributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us toreopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network.Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operationsand financial condition.         Our ability to attract consumers and grow ourrevenues is dependent on the success of our store location          strategyand our ability to successfully open new stores as planned.      Our sales are dependent inpart on the location of our stores in shopping centers where we believe ourconsumers and potential consumers shop.  In addition, our ability to grow ourrevenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space forand open new stores in attractive locations.  Centers where we currentlyoperate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adversely affectedby, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularlyaffecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores,changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shoppingpreferences.  To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shoppingpreferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores indesirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense.A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where wegenerally locate our stores, or in availability or cost of space in desirable centersand locations could adversely affect consumer traffic and reduce our sales andnet earnings or increase our operating costs.      Our ability to open andoperate new stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond ourcontrol.  These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability toidentify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, and hireand train appropriate store personnel.  In addition, our continued expansioninto new regions of the country where we have not done business before maypresent new challenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as weenter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute ourplans for opening new stores or the failure of these stores to perform up toour expectations, could adversely affect our business, results of operationsand financial condition.         Failure to attract, train, and retain skilledpersonnel could adversely affect our business and our financial      condition.      Likemost retailers, we experience significant associate turnover rates,particularly among store sales associates and managers.  Because our continued store growthwill require the hiring and training of new associates, we must continuallyattract, hire and train new store associates to meet our staffing needs. Asignificant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates andmanagers would increase our recruiting and trainingcosts, as well as possibly cause a decrease in our store operating efficiencyand productivity.  We compete for qualified store associates, as well asexperienced management personnel with other companies in our industry or otherindustries, many of whom have greater financial resources than we do.11          In addition, we depend on key management personnel tooversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of ourexisting business and future expansion. The success of executing our businessstrategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for keymanagement personnel with other retailers and our inability to attract andretain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.      If we are unable to retain ourkey management and store associates or attract, train, or retain other skilledpersonnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customerseffectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect ourbusiness, results, and financial condition.         Our business operations subject us to legalcompliance and litigation risks that could result in increased         costs orliabilities, divert our management’s attention or otherwise adversely affectour business.      Our operations are subject tofederal, state and local laws, rules and regulations and litigation risk.  Compliancerisks and litigation claims have or may arise in the ordinary course of ourbusiness and may include, among other issues, employment issues, commercialdisputes, intellectual property issues, product-oriented matters, tax, customerrelations and personal injury claims.  These matters frequently raise complexfactual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties andcould divert significant management time.  In addition, governing laws, rulesand regulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to changefrom time to time.  Compliance and litigation matters could result inunexpected expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse affect on ouroperations and our reputation.         Ifwe fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights orinfringe the intellectual                 property rights of others, ourbusiness, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations and financialcondition could be adversely affected.       Webelieve that our “Cato”, “It’s Fashion”, “It’s Fashion Metro” and “Versona”trademarks are integral to our store designs, brand recognition and our abilityto successfully build consumer loyalty.  Although we have registered thesetrademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) and have alsoregistered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with the PTOthat we believe are important to our business, we cannot assure that theseregistrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts,store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our otherintellectual property rights by others. Infringement of our names, concepts,store designs or merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner thatprojects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our image couldadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.       In addition, we cannotassure that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our privatelabel merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks orother proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subjectto lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannotpredict; however, such a controversy could adversely effect our business,financial condition and results of operations. We may experience marketconditions that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and our abilityto access, our short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. 12        Our short-terminvestments and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments infederal, state, municipal and corporate debt securities.  The value of thosesecurities may be impacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes tocredit ratings, rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, andstrength and quality of market credit and liquidity.  As federal, state andmunicipal entities struggle with declining tax revenues and budget deficits, wecannot be assured of our ability to timely access these investments if themarket for these issues declines.   Similarly, the default by issuers couldadversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability toexecute our business strategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cashand cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of thefederally insured limits.   An economic downturn or development ofadverse conditions affecting the financial sector and stability of financialinstitutions could cause us to experience losses on our deposits.         Maintaining and improving our internal controlover financial reporting and other requirements necessary    to operate as apublic company may strain our resources and any material failure in thesecontrols may            negatively impact our business, the price of our commonstock and market confidence in our reported              financial information.      As a public company, we aresubject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York StockExchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and ConsumerProtection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and related rule-making that has been andwill continue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandatesof the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have,and may continue to, increase our compliance costs and place significant strainon our personnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the requirements of Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test,monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is acostly and time-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. Wecannot give assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and ourinternal control over financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, willbe adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness ofinternal control over financial reporting or to comply with the other variouslaws and regulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or towhich we may become subject in the future, as a public company could have anadverse material impact on our business, our financial condition and the priceof our common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with theserequirements, particularly with new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act thathave yet to be implemented, could significantly increase our compliance costs.         Changes to accounting rules and regulations mayadversely affect our reported results of operations and         financialcondition.      In an effort to providegreater comparability of financial reporting in an increasing globalenvironment, accounting regulatory authorities are entering into collaborativeefforts to converge U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles withInternational Financial Reporting Standards.

Such a change would require Cato torecord a significant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities on ourbalance sheet and make other changes to the recording and classification of lease-relatedexpenses on our statements of income and cash flows. This change could lead to the perception by investors that we arehighly leveraged and would change the calculation of numerous financial metricsand measures of our performance and financial condition. This and other futurechanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reportedresults of operations and financial position.  13          The Company’s ability tosuccessfully integrate new businesses into its existing business, to the extentit enters new lines of business in the future, will affect the Company’sfinancial condition and results of operations.      TheCompany’s long-term business strategy includes growth through the developmentof new store concepts.

8,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2010-03-30,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors:     An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of    risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors,    in addition to the other information contained in this report,    including the disclosures under Forward Looking    Information above in evaluating our Company and any    potential investment in our common stock. If any of the    following risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial    condition and operating results could be materially and    adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could    decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in    our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this    section are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and    uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently    deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our    business operating results and financial condition. Risks    Relating To Our Business: If we    are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly    changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner,    our business and results of operations could materially    suffer.     Customer tastes and fashion trends, particularly for    womens apparel, are volatile and tend to change rapidly.    Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate and    respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences    in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to    anticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trends    could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise,    which in turn could adversely affect our business and our image    with our customers. If we miscalculate either the market for our    merchandise or our customers tastes or purchasing habits,    we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold    inventory at below average markups over cost, or below cost,    which would adversely affect our margins and results of    operations. Existing    and increased competition in the womens retail apparel    industry may negatively impact our business, results of    operations, financial condition and market share.     The womens retail apparel industry is highly competitive.    We compete primarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers,    department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores, and    internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially    greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have.    Many of our competitors continue    7Table of Contents    to be promotional and reduce their selling prices. In some cases    our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a    significant market presence. As a result of this competition,    including close-out sales and going-out-of-business sales by    other womens apparel retailers, we may experience pricing    pressures, increased marketing expenditures, as well as, loss of    market share, which could materially and adversely affect our    business, results of operations and financial condition. Unusual    weather, natural disasters or similar events may adversely    affect our sales or operations.     Extreme changes in weather patterns or natural disasters can    influence customer trends and shopping habits. For example,    heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a    prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to    travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and    profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable    weather conditions. For example, extended periods of    unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool    weather during the summer season could render a portion of our    inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions.    Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather    conditions would adversely affect our business. Extreme weather    patterns, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts or    other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our    stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations,    which could materially and adversely affect us. We    source a significant portion of our merchandise directly and    indirectly from overseas, and changes, disruptions or other    problems affecting the Companys merchandise supply chain,    could materially and adversely affect the Companys    business, results of operations and financial    condition.     A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas    principally in the Far East. We directly import some of this    merchandise and indirectly import the remaining merchandise from    domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreign    sources. As a result, political instability or other events    resulting in the disruption of trade from other countries,    increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or the    imposition of additional regulations relating to or duties on    imports, could cause significant delays or interruptions in the    supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. Either of these    could have a material adverse effect on our business. In    addition, increased transportation costs or disruption of the    means by which merchandise is transported to us could cause    significant cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain.    If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries or    other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different    countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different    or inferior quality from the ones we now sell. Furthermore, the    deterioration in any of our key vendors financial    condition, their failure to perform as we expect, the failure to    follow our vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and    regulations could expose us to operational, competitive and    legal risks. If we were not able to timely or adequately replace    the merchandise we currently source with merchandise produced    elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect, our    business, results of operations and financial condition could be    adversely affected. Our    costs are affected by foreign currency    fluctuations.     Because we purchase a significant portion of our inventory from    foreign suppliers, our cost of these goods is affected by the    fluctuation of the local currencies where these goods are    produced against the dollar. Accordingly, changes in the value    of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our    cost of goods sold and, if we are unable to pass such cost    increases on to our customers, decrease our gross margins and    ultimately our earnings. Accordingly, foreign currency    fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business,    financial condition and results of operations. A    continuation of, or further deterioration in, the current    adverse economic conditions and the general economy or outlook    and its related impact on consumer confidence and spending may    materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our apparel    and accessories and our results of operations.     Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and    accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing    economic conditions, levels of employment, fuel and energy    costs, salaries and wage rates and other sources of income, tax    rates, home values, consumer net worth, the availability of    consumer credit, consumer confidence or consumer perceptions of    economic conditions or trends. The current adverse economic and    credit    8Table of Contents    markets along with other factors have significantly weakened    many of these drivers of consumer spending habits. As a result,    consumer confidence and spending have significantly deteriorated    and may continue to do so for an extended period of time, which    may continue to adversely affect our net sales and results of    operations. Adverse economic conditions or uncertainties also    generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary    items, such as our merchandise or by purchasing cheaper    alternatives to our merchandise, all of which may also adversely    affect our net sales and results of operations. In addition,    numerous events, whether or not related to actual economic    conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war    or terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, or similar    events, may also dampen consumer confidence, and accordingly,    lead to reduced consumer spending. A continuation or worsening    of the current economic downturn and reduction in consumer    confidence could have a material adverse effect on our business,    results of operations and financial condition. The    failure, disruption or security breach relating to our    information technology systems could adversely affect our    business.     We rely on our existing information technology systems for    merchandise operations including merchandise planning,    replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life    cycle management. In addition to merchandise operations, we    utilize our information technology systems for our distribution    processes, as well as our financial systems including accounts    payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales, banking,    inventory and fixed assets. Any disruption in the operation of    our information technology systems, or our failure to continue    to upgrade or improve such systems could adversely affect our    business. In addition, any security breach or other problem that    results in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer    information, such as personally identifiable information and    payment information, could adversely affect our standing with    customers and expose us to the risk of litigation and liability.    Any such occurrences could result in reputational damage or loss    of business or goodwill and could adversely affect our business,    results of operations and financial condition. A    disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or    transportation network could materially and adversely affect our    business and results of operations.     The distribution of our products is centralized in one    distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed    through our network of third party freight carriers. The    merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution    center where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate    stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by our third    party freight carriers. If the distribution center or our third    party freight carriers were to be shutdown or lose significant    capacity for any reason, our operations would likely be    seriously disrupted. Such problems could occur as the result of    any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our    distribution center, as well as any broader problem generally    affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center    or delivery to our stores. As a result, we could incur    significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with    distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes    for us to reopen or replace the distribution center and/or our    transportation network. Our    ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependant    on the success of our store location strategy and our ability to    successfully open new stores as planned.     Our sales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in    shopping centers where we believe our consumers and potential    consumers shop. In addition, our ability to grow our revenues    has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space    for and open new stores in attractive locations. Centers where    we currently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores    may be adversely affected by, among other things, general    economic downturns or those particularly affecting the    commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores,    changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shopping    preferences. To take advantage of consumer traffic and the    shopping preferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and    acquire stores in desirable locations where competition for    suitable store locations is intense. A decline in the popularity    of these shopping centers among our target consumers, or in    availability or cost of space in these centers could adversely    affect consumer traffic and reduce our sales and net earnings or    increase our operating costs.     Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on many    factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors    include, but are not limited to, our ability to identify    suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable    9Table of Contents    lease terms, and hire and train appropriate store personnel. In    addition, our continued expansion into new regions of the    country where we have not done business before may present new    challenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as we    enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely    execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these    stores to perform up to our expectations, could adversely affect    our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure    to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely    affect our business and our financial condition.     Like most retailers, we experience significant associate    turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and    managers. Our continued store growth will require the hiring and    training of new associates. We must continually attract, hire    and train new store associates to meet our staffing needs. A    significant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales    associates and managers would increase our recruiting and    training costs as well as possibly cause a decrease in our store    operating efficiency and productivity. We compete for qualified    store associates, as well as, experienced management personnel    with other companies in our industry or other industries, many    of whom have greater financial resources than we do.     If we are unable to retain our associates or attract, train, or    retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able    to service our customers effectively, which could adversely    affect our business, results, and financial condition. Our    business operations subject us to legal compliance and    litigation risks that could result in increased costs or    liabilities, divert our managements attention or otherwise    adversely affect our business.     Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws,    rules and regulations and litigation risk. Compliance risks and    litigation claims have or may arise in the ordinary course of    our business and may include, among other matters, employment    issues, commercial disputes, intellectual property issues,    product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal    injury claims. These matters frequently raise complex factual    and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties    and could divert significant management time. In addition,    governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations of    existing laws are subject to change from time to time.    Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpected    expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our    operations and our reputation. If we    fail to protect our trademarks or other intellectual property    rights or avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of    others, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of    operations and financial condition could be adversely    affected.     We believe that our Cato, Its Fashion    and Its Fashion Metro trademarks are integral to our    store designs and our ability to successfully build consumer    loyalty. We have registered these trademarks with the    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and have    also registered, or applied for registration of, additional    trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to our    business. We cannot assure that these registrations will prevent    imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts, store    designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our    other intellectual property rights by others. Imitation of our    names, concepts, store designs or merchandise in a manner that    projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our    image could adversely affect our business, financial condition    and results of operations.     In addition, we cannot assure that others will not try to block    the manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by    claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks or other    proprietary rights. Although we cannot currently estimate the    likelihood of success of any such lawsuit or ultimate resolution    of such a conflict, such a controversy could adversely affect    our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may    continue to experience market conditions that could adversely    impact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to    access, our short-term investments and cash and cash    equivalents.     Our short-term investments and cash equivalents are primarily    comprised of investments in federal, state and municipal debt    securities. With the continuing downturn in the economy, we    cannot be assured of our ability to    10Table of Contents    access these investments timely. In addition, we have    significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial    institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits.    In light of the continuing economic downturn and adverse    conditions affecting the financial sector and stability of    financial institutions, we cannot be assured that we will not    experience losses on our deposits. Maintaining    and improving our internal control over financial reporting and    other requirements necessary to operate as a public company may    strain our resources and any material failure in these controls    may negatively impact our business, the price of our common    stock and market confidence in our reported financial    information.     As a public company, we are subject to the reporting    requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules of the New York Stock    Exchange. The requirements of these rules and regulations have,    and may continue to, increase our compliance costs and place    undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. To satisfy    the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance    our internal controls over financial reporting, which is a    costly and time-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated    frequently. We cannot be assured that our disclosure controls    and procedures and our internal controls over financial    reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley    Act will be adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the    effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or    to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could    have an adverse material impact on our business, our financial    condition and the price of our common stock. Risks    Relating To Our Common Stock: Our    operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly    fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of    our common stock.     Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are    characteristic of the retail apparel industry. As a result, our    stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net    sales and profitability in the first and second quarters of our    fiscal year compared to other quarters. Accordingly, our    operating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily    indicative of results to be expected from any future period, and    such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations could adversely affect    the market price of our common stock. The    interests of a principal shareholder may limit the ability of    other shareholders to influence the direction of the    Company.     As of March 30, 2010, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President    and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially controlled    approximately 39% of the voting power of our common stock. As a    result, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantly    influence substantially all matters requiring approval by the    shareholders, including the election of directors and the    approval of mergers and other business combinations.    Mr. Cato may have interests that differ from those of other    shareholders, and may vote in a way with which other    shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to their interests.    In addition, the concentration of voting power held by    Mr. Cato could have the effect of preventing, discouraging    or deferring a change in control of the Company, which could    depress the market price of our common stock. Conditions    in the stock market, generally or particularly relating to our    Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affect the    market price of our common stock and make its trading price more    volatile.     The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is    likely to continue to be, subject to significant volatility. A    variety of factors may cause the price of the common stock to    fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, but not limited to:    low trading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from    factors not directly related to our operations or the inherent    value of our common stock; announcements of developments related    to our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results;    general conditions in fashion and retail industry; conditions in    the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit    or capital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scope    of coverage given to our Company by securities analysts;    negative commentary regarding our Company    11Table of Contents    and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adverse    customer relations developments; significant changes in our    senior management team; and legal proceedings. Over the past    several years the stock market in general, and the market for    shares of equity securities of many retailers in particular,    have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times    been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies.    Such fluctuations and market volatility based on these or other    factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of    our common stock. "

If any of the    following risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial    condition and operating results could be materially and    adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could    decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in    our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this    section are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and    uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently    deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our    business operating results and financial condition. Risks    Relating To Our Business: If we    are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly    changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner,    our business and results of operations could materially    suffer.     Customer tastes and fashion trends, particularly for    womens apparel, are volatile and tend to change rapidly.    Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate and    respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences    in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to    anticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trends    could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise,    which in turn could adversely affect our business and our image    with our customers. If we miscalculate either the market for our    merchandise or our customers tastes or purchasing habits,    we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold    inventory at below average markups over cost, or below cost,    which would adversely affect our margins and results of    operations. Unusual    weather, natural disasters or similar events may adversely    affect our sales or operations.     Extreme changes in weather patterns or natural disasters can    influence customer trends and shopping habits. For example,    heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a    prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to    travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and    profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable    weather conditions. For example, extended periods of    unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool    weather during the summer season could render a portion of our    inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions.    Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather    conditions would adversely affect our business. Extreme weather    patterns, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts or    other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our    stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations,    which could materially and adversely affect us. Changes    or other disruptions in the Companys merchandise supply    chain, including those affecting the pricing or importation of    goods from the foreign markets that supply a significant amount    of the Companys merchandise, could materially and    adversely affect the Companys costs and results of    operations.     A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured    overseas, principally in the Far East. As a result, political    instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade    from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations    relating to or duties on imports could cause significant delays    or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase    our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect    on our business. If we are forced to source merchandise from    other countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a    different or inferior    7Table of Contents    quality from the ones we now sell. If we were not able to timely    or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with    merchandise produced elsewhere, our business could be adversely    affected. Our    costs are affected by foreign currency    fluctuations.     Because we purchase a significant portion of our inventory from    foreign suppliers, our cost of these goods is affected by the    fluctuation of the local currencies where these goods are    produced against the dollar. Accordingly, changes in the value    of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our    cost of goods sold and, if we are unable to pass such cost    increases on to our customers, decrease our gross margins and    ultimately our earnings. Accordingly, foreign currency    fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business,    financial condition and results of operations. A    continuation of, or further deterioration in, the current    adverse conditions and the general economy or outlook and its    related impact on consumer confidence and spending may    materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our apparel    and accessories and our results of operations.     Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and    accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing    economic conditions, levels of employment, fuel and energy    costs; salaries and wage rates and other sources of income, tax    rates, home values, consumer net worth, the availability of    consumer credit, consumer confidence generally or consumer    perceptions of economic conditions or trends. The current    recessionary economic and adverse credit market along with other    factors have significantly weakened many of these drivers of    consumer spending habits. As a result, consumer confidence and    spending have significantly deteriorated and may continue to do    so for an extended period of time, which may continue to    adversely affect our net sales and results of operations.    Adverse economic conditions or uncertainties also generally    cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, such    as our merchandise or trade down the purchasing cheaper    alternatives to our merchandise, all of which may also adversely    affect our net sales and results of operations. In addition,    numerous events, whether or not related to actual economic    conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war    or terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, or similar    events, may also dampen consumer confidence, and accordingly    lead to reduced consumer spending. A continuation or worsening    of the current economic downturn and reduction in consumer    confidence could have a material adverse effect on our business,    results of operations and financial condition. A    disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center    could materially and adversely affect our business and results    of operations.     The distribution of our products is centralized in one    distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The    merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution    center where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate    stores. If the distribution center were to be shutdown or lose    significant capacity for any reason, our operations would likely    be seriously disrupted. Such problems could occur as the result    of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our    distribution center, as well as any broader problem generally    affecting the ability to ship goods into or out of the Charlotte    metropolitan area. As a result, we could incur significantly    higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing    our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to    reopen or replace the distribution center. A    delay in the successful opening of the number of new stores we    have planned could adversely affect our business and results of    operations.     Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on many    factors including our ability to identify suitable store    locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, and hire and train    appropriate store personnel. In addition, we continue to expand    our operations to new regions of the country where we have not    done business before. This expansion may present new challenges    in competition, distribution and merchandising as we enter these    new markets.    8Table of ContentsRisks    Relating To Our Common Stock: Our    operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly    fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of    our common stock.     Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are    characteristic of the retail apparel industry.

13,CATO,CATO CORP  -CL A,2008-04-01,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors:     An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of    risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors,    in addition to the other information contained in this report,    including the disclosures under Forward Looking    Information above in evaluating our Company and any    potential investment in our common stock. If any of the    following risks or uncertainties occurs, our business, financial    condition and operating results could be materially and    adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could    decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in    our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this    section are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and    uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently    deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our    business operating results and financial condition. Risks    Relating To Our Business: If we    are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly    changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner,    our business and results of operations could materially    suffer.     Customer tastes and fashion trends, particularly for    womens apparel, are volatile and tend to change rapidly.    Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate and    respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences    in a timely manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to    anticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trends    could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise,    which in turn could adversely affect our business and our image    with our customers. If we miscalculate either the market for our    merchandise or our customers tastes or purchasing habits,    we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold    inventory at below average markups over cost, or below cost,    which would adversely affect our margins and results of    operations. Unusual    weather, natural disasters or similar events may adversely    affect our sales or operations.     Extreme changes in weather patterns or natural disasters can    influence customer trends and shopping habits. For example,    heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a    prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to    travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and    profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable    weather conditions. For example, extended periods of    unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool    weather during the summer season could render a portion of our    inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions.    Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather    conditions would adversely affect our business. Extreme weather    patterns, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts or    other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our    stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations,    which could materially and adversely affect us.    7 Changes    or other disruptions in the Companys merchandise supply    chain, including those affecting the pricing or importation of    goods from the foreign markets that supply a significant amount    of the Companys merchandise, could materially and    adversely affect the Companys costs and results of    operations.     A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured    overseas, principally in the Far East. As a result, political    instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade    from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations    relating to or duties on imports could cause significant delays    or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase    our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect    on our business. If we are forced to source merchandise from    other countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a    different or inferior quality from the ones we now sell. If we    were not able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we    currently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, our    business could be adversely affected. Our    costs are affected by foreign currency    fluctuations.     Because we purchase a significant portion of our inventory from    foreign suppliers, our cost of these goods is affected by the    fluctuation of the local currencies where these goods are    produced against the dollar. Accordingly, changes in the value    of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our    cost of goods sold and, if we are unable to pass such cost    increases on to our customers, decrease our gross margins and    ultimately our earnings. Accordingly, foreign currency    fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business,    financial condition and results of operations. An    actual or perceived decline in general economic conditions or    outlook may reduce consumer demand for our apparel and    accessories.     Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and    accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing    economic conditions, levels of employment, fuel and energy    costs, salaries and wage rates, tax rates, the availability of    consumer credit, consumer confidence generally or consumer    perceptions of economic conditions or trends. A general slowdown    in the United States economy or a negative or uncertain economic    outlook may adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may    result in lower net sales. Numerous events, whether or not    related to actual economic conditions, such as downturns in the    stock markets, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or    natural disasters, or similar events, may dampen consumer    confidence, and accordingly lead to reduced consumer spending. A    prolonged economic downturn or loss of consumer confidence could    have a material adverse effect on our business, results of    operations and financial condition. A    disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center    could materially and adversely affect our business and results    of operations.     The distribution of our products is centralized in one    distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The    merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution    center where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate    stores. If the distribution center were to be shut down or lose    significant capacity for any reason, our operations would likely    be seriously disrupted. Such problems could occur as the result    of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our    distribution center, as well as any broader problem generally    affecting the ability to ship goods into or out of the Charlotte    metropolitan area. As a result, we could incur significantly    higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing    our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to    reopen or replace the distribution center. A    delay in the successful opening of the number of new stores we    have planned could adversely affect our business and results of    operations.     Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on many    factors including our ability to identify suitable store    locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, and hire and train    appropriate store personnel. In addition, we continue to expand    our operations to new regions of the country where we have not    done business before. This expansion may present new challenges    in competition, distribution and merchandising as we enter these    new markets.    8 Risks    Relating To Our Common Stock: Our    operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly    fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of    our common stock.     Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are    characteristic of the retail apparel industry. As a result, our    stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net    sales and profitability in the first quarter of our fiscal year    compared to other quarters. Such seasonal and quarterly    fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our    common stock. The    interests of a principal shareholder may limit the ability of    other shareholders to influence the direction of the    Company.     As of March 25, 2008, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President    and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially controlled    approximately 39% of the voting power of our common stock. As a    result, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantly    influence substantially all matters requiring approval by the    shareholders, including the election of directors and the    approval of mergers and other business combinations.    Mr. Cato may have interests that differ from those of other    shareholders, and may vote in a way with which other    shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to their interests.    In addition, the concentration of voting power held by    Mr. Cato could have the effect of preventing, discouraging    or deferring a change in control of the Company, which could    depress the market price of our common stock. "
