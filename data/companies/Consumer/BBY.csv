4,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2023-03-17,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Described below are certain risks we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. The risks are categorized using the following headings: external, strategic, operational, regulatory and legal, and financial and market. Each of the following risk factors should be carefully considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. 8 External Risks  Macroeconomic pressures, including, but not limited to, the current geopolitical climate, may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results. To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example: • whether or not they make a purchase;• their choice of brand, model or price-point;• how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and• their appetite for complementary services (for example, Best Buy Totaltech). Real GDP growth, inflation (including wage inflation), consumer confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic, employment levels, oil prices, interest, tax and foreign currency exchange rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, limitations on a government’s ability to borrow and/or spend capital, costs for items such as fuel and food, any recession (and resulting corresponding declines in consumer sentiment) in response at least in part to central banks’ actions to reduce inflation, bank failures or limited liquidity in accessing bank deposits, and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. In addition to general levels of inflation, we are also subject to risks of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due to, for example, high consumer demand, component shortages and supply chain disruption. We may be unable to increase our prices sufficiently to offset these pressures. Geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. For example, the conflict in Ukraine may continue to significantly impact fuel prices, inflation, the global supply chain and other macroeconomic conditions, which may further adversely affect global economic growth, consumer confidence and demand for our products and services. Russia is a significant global producer of both fuel and raw materials used in certain of the products we sell, including nickel, aluminum and copper. Disruptions in the markets for those inputs or other inputs produced by Russia, whether due to sanctions, market pressure not to purchase inputs from Russia or otherwise, could increase overall material costs for many of the products we sell. We cannot predict the extent or duration of sanctions in response to the conflict in Ukraine, nor can we predict the effects of legislative or other governmental actions or regulatory scrutiny of Russia, its allies or other countries with which Russia has significant trade or financial ties, including China. The conflict in Ukraine has exacerbated geopolitical tensions globally. Further deterioration of relations between Taiwan and China, the resulting actions taken, the response of the international community and other factors affecting trade with China or political or economic conditions in Taiwan could disrupt the manufacturing of products or hardware components in the region, such as semiconductors and television panels sourced from Taiwan or the broader array of products sourced from China. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain, the cost of our products or our revenues and financial results. Catastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our operating results. The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may consist of, or be caused by, for example: • natural disasters or extreme weather events, including those related to climate change;• diseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners;• earthquakes, floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers;• power loss, telecommunications failures, or software or hardware malfunctions; or• terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts. In recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets. Such events can adversely affect our workforce and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties. They can also disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain, distribution network and third-party business operations that may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for business operations at the quantities and levels we require. Finally, such events can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. The adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic in particular has had and may continue to subject our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks. These risks have included or may in the future continue to include: (i) significant reductions in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores; (ii) significant disruptions to our supply chain; (iii) fluctuating consumer spending, particularly in light of the provision of government stimulus funds; (iv) novel changes to our operations, such as the roll-out of contactless, curbside pick-up for our goods, (v) the implementation of safety standards by various state and federal agencies; (vi) risks related to the shift in channels in which customers choose to engage us, such as by switching to online shopping, which may affect our profitability; and (vii) our ability to finance our operations. The emergence of new and more transmissible, more virulent, and/or immune-evading SARS-COV-2 variants could exacerbate these risks. 9 Three of our largest states by total sales are California, Texas and Florida, areas where natural disasters and extreme weather conditions have been, and could continue to be, more prevalent. Natural disasters and climate-related events in those states and other areas where our sales and operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of our stores, distribution centers or other facilities.  Further, external social activism, tension and violence resulting from external events impacting social justice and inequality, and our response to them, may adversely affect our employees, customers, properties and the communities in which we operate. Also, if our customers and employees do not perceive our response to be appropriate or adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences. We operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technological innovation and disruption. This manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, the often rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, changing price points, and product replacement and upgrade cycles. This rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Strategic Risks  We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability. While we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us. The retail sector continues to experience increased sales initiated online and using mobile applications, as well as online sales for both in-store or curbside pick-up. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-cost or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins. As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability. If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. In addition, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability. Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include, for example, employee engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations. We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. We may also be subject to continued market pressure to increase employee hourly wage rates and increased cost pressure on employer-provided benefits. Our need to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material adverse impact to the profitability of our business. 10 Our strategy to expand into health and new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks. As we introduce new products and services, we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new and difficult technology and regulatory challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues. This expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise. With our focus on healthcare, new products and services may frequently require regulatory approvals for market introduction. The number and diversity of regulatory bodies add complexity and may negatively impact time to market and implementation costs. For example, the healthcare space in which we operate is highly regulated from a product safety and quality perspective, and its services and products, including parts or materials from suppliers, are subject to regulation by various government and regulatory agencies including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Non-compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities could result in product recalls, a temporary ban on products, stoppages at production facilities, remediation costs, orders to stop providing services, fines or claims for damages. Product safety incidents or user concerns could trigger business reviews by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, which, if failed, could trigger these impacts. In addition, the ongoing digitalization of Best Buy Health’s products and services, including our holding of personal health data and medical data, increases the importance of compliance with data privacy and similar laws. The services and systems used in certain instances subject us to privacy and information security requirements, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system interruption risks. Given our acquisition of Current Health, a care-at-home technology platform, we also are subject to the UK’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other regulatory frameworks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and reputation. Our focus on services exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability, as well as our reputation. We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example: • pressure on services attachment as a result of the sustained increase in consumer desire to purchase product offerings online and through mobile applications;• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises;• increased pressure on margins from our Best Buy Totaltech membership offering, which includes incremental customer benefits, and associated costs, compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer, and the risk that increased volumes will not fully compensate for lower margins, or for loss of revenue and profit from revenue streams that are now included as benefits;• pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs;• use of third-party services that do not meet our standards or comply with applicable labor and independent contractor regulations, leading to potential reputational damage and liability risk;• increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;• employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the privacy of the data they hold; • the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake;• the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and catastrophic events; and• increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services. 11 Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability. We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2023, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, HP, LG and Sony - representing approximately 57% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition for those products. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms. We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers may also serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focus on consumer experience. We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. Operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. External factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. Third parties may commit fraud while using our brand without our permission, possibly harming brand perception or reputation. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business. We may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, “new ventures”). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty, and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example: • different and incremental business and other risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments;• failure to attract, motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;• uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;• failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;• failure to maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting;• failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;• unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;• disputes or strategic differences with key employees or other third-party participants in the new venture; and• adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture. If new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management’s attention from other important areas of our business. 12 Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results. Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omnichannel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased under multi-year contracts. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example: • changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omnichannel environment;• our ability to adjust store operating models to adapt to these changing patterns;• the location and appropriate number of stores, supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio;• the interior layout, format and size of our stores;• the products and services we offer at each store;• the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;• the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store; and• the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents. If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example: • closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;• incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;• operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and• bearing excessive lease expenses. These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity. For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are typically still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant. Operational Risks Interruptions and other factors affecting our stores and supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business. Our stores and supply chain assets are a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors’ abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, at the right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to: • interruptions to our delivery capabilities;• failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;• disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;• limitations in capacity;• global supply chain impacts that could hinder our vendors’ ability to meet our demand for product volumes and timing;• increased levels of inventory loss due to organized crime, theft or damage;• risk to our employees and customers arising from burglary or robbery from our stores or other facilities;• consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;• labor strikes, slow-downs or labor shortages, including as a result of an increasingly competitive job market, affecting our stores or impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;• diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns; and• increasing transportation costs. It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network, whether due to geopolitical conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability. 13 We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationships or their services may have an adverse impact on our business. We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, delivery and installation, customer warranty, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, technical support, transportation, insurance programs and human resource operations. Any material disruption in our relationships with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods. Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Best Buy Essentials, Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, as well as products such as Jitterbug and Lively branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers in China and Southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results: • we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brands product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;• we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brands products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;• we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics, unforeseen natural disasters or geopolitical crises, such as the conflict in Ukraine and this conflict’s potential impact on global geopolitical tensions, including with China or between China and Taiwan;• we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brands products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;• we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return-to-vendor rights;• we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacturing of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;• we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brands products;• our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply; and• we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brands products or manufacturing processes. Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brands products and the profits we are able to generate from them. We are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S. Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including COVID-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment (including, for example, our Urgent Response service provided by Best Buy Health), staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. 14 Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions, including ransomware and phishing attacks), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. While we have adopted, and continue to enhance, business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies, there is no guarantee that such plans and strategies will be effective, which could interrupt the functionality of our information technology systems or those of third parties. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers, cloud platforms or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation. As we continue to migrate more systems to the cloud, we may face additional risks that may compromise our security or disrupt our business capabilities, including ensuring the proper configuration, the unknowns of operating more workloads in the cloud, securing systems in the cloud and the types of cloud-based services we leverage. We face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. We utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks by governments, criminals or other non-state actors, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues and incur material costs, and could adversely affect our reputation. Further, as our online interactions and sales have increased and have become critical to our growth, and as many employees now use hybrid or full-time remote-working arrangements, the risk of any interruption of our information technology system capabilities is heightened, as well as the risk that customer demand exceeds the capacity of our online operations. Any such interruption or capacity constraint could result in a deterioration of our ability to process online sales, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.  Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions. Our business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information and protected health information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which process and transmit information for a variety of activities. We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems. While we engage in significant data-protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner or otherwise seek to extract financial gain based on access to or possession of company, employee or customer information. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, and given the potentially disruptive nature of emerging technologies, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims. Sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships. Increasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud or criminal activity and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, recently applicable and potential new or significantly revised state, provincial and federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business are expanding our obligations to protect and honor the privacy and security of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach or compliance failure. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. 15 Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. As an employer of more than 90,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example: • the organization of unions and related rules that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board frequently considers;• laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and the classification of employees and independent contractors; and• laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide. Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability. Regulatory and Legal Risks We are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments that could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to: • the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;• the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;• the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;• the financial, operational and business impact of evolving regulations governing data privacy and security, including limitations on the collection, use or sharing of information; consumer rights to access, delete or limit/opt-out of the use of information; or litigation arising from new private rights of action; • the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other future legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;• the impact of litigation, including class-action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and• the impact of changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies, such as economic, fiscal, tax, retail, labor and social policies. The impact of geopolitical tensions, including the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, political or trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of tariffs or other trade actions that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects. Further, the impact of potential changes in U.S., state or other countries’ tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management’s attention and resources from other matters. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, compliance, transportation and utility cost increases. Our own climate change-oriented initiatives, such as our attempts to increase energy efficiency during store construction and remodeling, could also increase our costs. In addition, changes to the environment, both long-term and short-term, may affect consumer shopping behavior in a way that negatively impacts our revenue, revenue mix and profitability. 16 Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks. We are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s recently proposed climate-related reporting requirements, and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG-related matters, in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of ESG on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected. Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate. We operate retail locations in Canada, Current Health operates in the UK, and most of our exclusive brands products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly-owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius and the UK. During fiscal 2023, our International segment’s operations generated approximately 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example: • political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;• economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;• rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;• government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events;• cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;• different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and• difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations. These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs. Financial and Market Risks Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors’ because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our hourly pay structure, our differentiated service offerings or our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives. We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management information systems, or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.‎17Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2023 revenue was transacted using one of the company’s branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs. Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. We typically hold material balances of cash, cash equivalents and/or short-term investments and are therefore reliant on banks and other financial institutions to safeguard and allow ready access to these assets. Our future liquidity will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for and financial stability of banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs. Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. Failure to meet any financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we may provide to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. When we provide guidance, we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, but such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce any guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline"
11,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2022-03-18,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Described below are certain risks we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. The risks are categorized using the following headings: external, strategic, operational, regulatory and legal, and financial and market. Each of the following risk factors should be carefully considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. External Risks  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks, and those risks may intensify or last for an extended period of time. Future pandemics may also introduce similar risks. Risks Related to Sales and Customer Demand: At various times throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic and the operational changes we have made have resulted in significant reductions in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores. The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and its resurgences; the extent of the impact on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates, consumer discretionary spending and consumer confidence; actions governments take, including governments’ positions towards monetary and/or fiscal policy, including potential stimulus or the timing and nature of loosening of restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic and its resurgence; interruptions and other supply chain issues; actions businesses and individuals take in their ongoing responses to the pandemic; and our ability to successfully navigate those impacts. During the pandemic, consumer spending on consumer electronics has generally been higher than pre-pandemic levels. After the pandemic, consumers might shift their spending back towards categories or industries that were affected by the pandemic and away from consumer electronic categories. In addition, the pandemic has caused some products and services to be in high demand, and we may not be able to meet this demand in all of our categories due to product shortages or decisions by our vendors to allocate products to certain customers due to the circumstances resulting from the pandemic, and our vendors may increase prices, each of which may adversely impact our revenue and profitability. The pandemic has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our products and services that historically have been more likely to be purchased in a physical store than online.  8 Risks Related to Operations: The pandemic forced us to make a number of operational changes. Although we continue to offer a contactless, curbside model for those who prefer to shop that way, we could be required to return to a curbside-only model or close stores due to the current or future resurgence of the pandemic (including the potential emergence of new and more transmissible variants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants). Our ability to continue to sell our products and services is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety of our customers and those employees who are needed to work at our stores and distribution facilities. Failure to maintain the recommended or required safety standards as defined by the CDC, federal and state Occupational Safety and Health agencies and local governments could also result in an increased risk of regulatory action or civil litigation. The ability of our employees to work may continue to be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19 and its resurgences and by the availability and efficacy of vaccinations, particularly against new variants of COVID-19. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our customers and employees, these measures may not be successful, and we may be required to temporarily close distribution centers or stores from time to time, halt certain services or take other measures. Also, if our customers and employees do not perceive our response to be appropriate or adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future. Additionally, while we have continued to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and customers as we continue to operate during the pandemic, we may face an increased risk of litigation related to our operating environments. The pandemic may also cause increased cybersecurity risk, as cybercriminals attempt to capitalize from the disruption, including remote working arrangements. Preparing for and responding to the continuing pandemic could divert management’s attention from our key strategic priorities; increase costs as we prioritize health and safety matters for our employees and customers; cause us to reduce, delay, alter or abandon initiatives that may otherwise increase our long-term value; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. Risks Related to Profitability: To the extent the pandemic continues to cause fundamental shifts in the channels in which customers choose to engage us, our profitability may be adversely impacted. Facility costs such as rent, depreciation and property taxes are largely fixed, regardless of whether we are able to keep our stores open, and our online mix of products and services generally produces lower gross profit rates than in-store sales. We also tend to see lower online revenue for certain service offerings that have higher profitability rates. To the extent we are not able to maintain or increase the level of customer traffic in our stores or maintain or enable a more profitable mix of sales in our digital and online channels, our profitability may be materially negatively impacted. We have also incurred costs due to the operational changes we have made in response to the pandemic, and these costs have adversely impacted our profitability. As a result of disruptions to our supply chain, primarily due to mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured and domestic labor shortages impacting the ports, our distribution centers and our product delivery services, we are experiencing, and may continue to experience, increased costs for shipping and transportation resources. If we are unable to manage these costs and supply chain disruptions, our profitability may be adversely impacted. Even after the pandemic subsides, we could experience a longer-term impact on our costs, for example, the need for enhanced health and hygiene and testing requirements to counteract the risk of future outbreaks. In the event of continued decreased store traffic, certain of our stores may not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, which could adversely affect the value of our owned and leased properties, potentially requiring us to record more significant non-cash impairment charges in future periods. Risks Related to Our Debt and Global Financing Markets: We may find it necessary to increase our cash position and our debt in the future in response to further resurgences of COVID-19. In the event we are required to raise capital, our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our prospects, our credit ratings and our business and industry outlook. There is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.  COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we have identified in this section, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Further, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, the effects of COVID-19, may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results. To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example: • whether or not they make a purchase;• their choice of brand, model or price-point;• how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and• their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans). Real GDP growth, consumer confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation (including wage inflation), employment levels (including as a result of an increasingly tight job market), oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. In addition to general levels of inflation, we are also subject to risks of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due to, for example, high consumer demand, component shortages and supply chain disruption. We may be unable to increase our prices sufficiently to offset these pressures. 9 Geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. For example, the ultimate impact of the conflict in Ukraine on fuel prices, inflation, the global supply chain and other macroeconomic conditions is unknown and could materially adversely affect global economic growth, consumer confidence and demand for our products and services. Russia is a significant global producer of both fuel and raw materials used in certain of the products we sell, including nickel, aluminum and copper. Disruptions in the markets for those inputs or other inputs produced by Russia, whether due to sanctions, market pressure not to purchase inputs from Russia or otherwise, could increase overall material costs for many of the products we sell. We cannot predict the extent or duration of sanctions in response to the conflict in Ukraine, nor can we predict the effects of legislative or other governmental actions or regulatory scrutiny of Russia, its allies or other countries with which Russia has significant trade or financial ties, including China. The conflict in Ukraine may also exacerbate geopolitical tensions globally. Similarly, further deterioration of relations between Taiwan and China, the resulting actions taken, the response of the international community and other factors affecting trade with China or political or economic conditions in Taiwan could disrupt the manufacturing of products or hardware components in the region, such as semiconductors and television panels sourced from Taiwan or the broader array of products sourced from China. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain, the cost of our products or our revenues and financial results. Catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results. The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may consist of, or be caused by, for example: • natural disasters or extreme weather events, including those related to climate change;• diseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners;• floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers; or• terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts. In recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets. Such events can adversely affect our workforce and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties. They can also disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain, distribution network and third-party business operations that may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for business operations at the quantities and levels we require. Finally, such events can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. Three of our largest states by total sales are California, Texas and Florida, areas where natural disasters and extreme weather conditions have been, and could continue to be, more prevalent. Natural disasters and climate-related events in those states and other areas where our sales and operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of our stores, distribution centers or other facilities. Further, external social activism, tension and violence resulting from external events impacting social justice and inequality, and our response to them, may adversely affect our employees, customers, properties and the communities in which we operate. Also, if our customers and employees do not perceive our response to be appropriate or adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences. We operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. This manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, the often rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, changing price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles. This rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. In addition, consumer preferences may be influenced even further as the social and economic environment navigates through the COVID-19 pandemic. These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. 10 Strategic Risks  We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability. While we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us. The retail sector has experienced an immense increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, as well as online sales for both in-store or curbside pick-up. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-cost or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins. As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability. If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. In addition, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability. Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly-trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and has increased during the pandemic, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include, for example, employee engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations. We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. We may also be subject to continued market pressure to increase employee hourly wage rates and increased cost pressure on employer-provided benefits. Our need to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material adverse impact to the profitability of our business. Our strategy to expand into new products, services, health and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks. As we introduce new products and services, using new technologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new and difficult technology and regulatory challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues.  This expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise. The healthcare space in which we operate is highly regulated from a product safety and quality perspective, and its services and products, including parts or materials from suppliers, are subject to regulation by various government and regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In the European Union, a Medical Device Regulation was published in 2017 that will impose significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements on some of our offerings.With our focus on healthcare, new products and services may frequently require regulatory approvals for market introduction. The number and diversity of regulatory bodies add complexity and may negatively impact time to market and implementation costs. Non-compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities could result in product recalls, a temporary ban on products, stoppages at production facilities, remediation costs, fines or claims for damages. Product safety incidents or user concerns could trigger business reviews by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, which, if failed, could trigger these impacts. 11 In addition, the ongoing digitalization of Best Buy Health’s products and services, including our holding of personal health data and medical data, increases the importance of compliance with data privacy and similar laws. The services and systems used in certain instances subject us to privacy and information security requirements, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system interruption risks. Given our acquisition of Current Health Ltd., a care-at-home technology platform, we also are subject to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other newly applicable regulatory frameworks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and reputation. Our focus on services exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability, as well as our reputation. We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example: • pressure on services attachment as a result of the sustained increase in consumer desire to purchase product offerings online and through mobile applications;• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises;• increased pressure on margins as we roll out our Totaltech membership offering, which includes incremental customer benefits, and associated costs, compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer, and the risk that increased volumes will not fully compensate for lower margins, or for loss of revenue and profit from revenue streams that are now included as benefits;• pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs;• use of third-party services that do not meet our standards or comply with applicable labor and independent contractor regulations, leading to potential reputational damage and liability risk; • increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;• employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the privacy of the data they hold; • the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake;• the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and catastrophic events; and• increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services. Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability. We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2022, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, HP, LG and Sony - representing approximately 56% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition for those products. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms. We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers may also serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. 12 Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focus on consumer experience. We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. Operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. External factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business. We may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, “new ventures”). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty, and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example: • different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments;• failure to attract, motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;• uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;• failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;• failure to maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting;• failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;• unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;• disputes or strategic differences with key employees or other third-party participants in the new venture; and• adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture. If new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management’s attention from other important areas of our business. Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results. Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omnichannel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased under multi-year contracts. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example: • changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omnichannel environment;• our ability to adjust store operating models to adapt to these changing patterns, as we have done with our curbside pick-up and ship-from-store models;• the location and appropriate number of stores, supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio;• the interior layout, format and size of our stores;• the products and services we offer at each store;• the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;• the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store; and• the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents. If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example: • closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;• incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;• operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and• bearing excessive lease expenses. These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity. For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are typically still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant. 13 Operational Risks Interruptions and other factors affecting our stores and supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business. Our stores and supply chain assets are a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors’ abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, at the right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to: • interruptions to our delivery capabilities;• failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;• disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;• limitations in capacity;• global supply-chain impacts that could hinder our vendors’ ability to meet our demand for product volumes and timing;• increased levels of inventory loss due to organized crime, theft or damage;• risk to our employees and customers arising from burglary or robbery from our stores or other facilities;• consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;• labor strikes, slow-downs or labor shortages, including as a result of an increasingly competitive job market, affecting our stores or impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;• diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns;• increasing transportation costs; and • the COVID-19 pandemic and disruptions as a result of efforts to control or mitigate the pandemic (such as facility closures, governmental orders, outbreaks and/or transportation capacity). It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network, whether due to geopolitical conflicts, COVID-19 or other factors, could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability. We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationship or their services may have an adverse impact on our business. We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, delivery and installation, customer warranty, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, technical support, transportation, insurance programs and human resource operations. Any material disruption in our relationships with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods. Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Best Buy Essentials, Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, as well as products such as Jitterbug and Lively branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results: • we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brands product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;• we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brands products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;• we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to COVID-19, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics, unforeseen natural disasters or geopolitical crises, such as the conflict in Ukraine and this conflict’s potential impact on global geopolitical tensions, including with China or between China and Taiwan;• we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brands products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;• we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return-to-vendor rights;• we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacturing of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;• we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brands products;‎ 14 • our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply;• we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brands products or manufacturing processes; and• regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country-of-origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation. Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brands products and the profits we are able to generate from them. We are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S. Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including COVID-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions, including the recent increasing use of “ransomware” and phishing attacks), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. While we have adopted, and continue to enhance, business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies, there is no guarantee that such plans and strategies will be effective, which could interrupt the functionality of our information technology systems or those of third parties. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation. As we continue to migrate more systems to the cloud, we may face additional risks that may compromise our security or disrupt our business capabilities, including ensuring the proper configuration, the unknowns of operating more workloads in the cloud, securing systems in the cloud and the types of cloud-based services we leverage. We face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. We utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks by governments, criminals or other non-state actors, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues and incur material costs and could adversely affect our reputation. Further, as our online sales have increased and have become critical to our growth, and as we have shifted to remote working arrangements for many employees, the risk of any interruption of our information technology system capabilities is heightened, as well as the risk that customer demand exceeds the capacity of our online operations. Any such interruption or capacity constraint could result in a deterioration of our ability to process online sales, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.  15 Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions. Our business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information and protected health information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which process and transmit information for a variety of activities. We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems. While we engage in significant data-protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner or otherwise seek to extract financial gain based on access to or possession of company, employee or customer information. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims. Sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships. Increasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud or criminal activity and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, new laws, such as the California Privacy Rights Act, Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and the Colorado Privacy Act, and laws newly applicable to us, such as the UK GDPR, are expanding our obligations to protect and honor the privacy and security of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. As an employer of approximately 105,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example: • the organization of unions and related rules that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board frequently considers;• laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and the classification of employees and independent contractors; and• laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide. Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability. Regulatory and Legal Risks We are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments that could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to: • the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;• the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;• the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;• the financial, operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security; ‎ 16 • the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters (including increased focus on environmental, social and governance matters by certain investors and regulators); escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other future legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;• the impact of litigation, including class-action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and• the impact of changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies, such as economic, fiscal, tax, retail, labor and social policies. The impact of geo-political tensions, including the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of tariffs or other trade actions that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects. Further, the impact of potential changes in U.S., state or other countries’ tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management’s attention and resources from other matters. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, compliance, transportation and utility cost increases. Our own climate change-oriented initiatives, such as our attempts to increase energy efficiency during store construction and remodeling, could also increase our costs. In addition, changes to the environment, both long-term and short-term, may affect consumer shopping behavior in a way that negatively impacts our revenue, revenue mix and profitability. Further, as the COVID-19 pandemic and its resurgences persist, we will continue to face risk and uncertainty as it relates to federal, state and local government public health orders or mandates, which may restrict how we do business and potentially impact our performance and profitability. Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate. We operate retail locations in Canada. All of our former stores in Mexico were closed as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In addition, most of our exclusive brands products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius and the U.K. During fiscal 2022, our International segment’s operations generated approximately 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example: • political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;• economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;• rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;• government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events;• cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;• different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and• difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations. These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs. Financial and Market Risks Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors’ because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our hourly pay structure, our differentiated service offerings or our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives. 17 We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic, natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, there is risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected. Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2022 revenue was transacted using one of the company’s branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs. Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs. Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. Failure to meet any financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we may provide to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. When we provide guidance, we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, but such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce any guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline"
12,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2021-03-19,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Described below are certain risks we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. The risks are categorized using the following headings: external, strategic, operational, regulatory and legal, and financial and market. Each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. External Risks  The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks, and those risks may intensify or last for an extended period of time.  Risks Related to Sales and Customer Demand: At various times during fiscal 2021, the pandemic and the operational changes we have made have resulted in significant reductions in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores. The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration of the pandemic; the extent of the impact on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates, consumer discretionary spending and consumer confidence; actions governments take, including governments’ positions towards monetary and/or fiscal policy, including potential stimulus or the timing and nature of loosening of restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic and its resurgence; actions businesses and individuals take in their ongoing responses to the pandemic; and our ability to successfully navigate those impacts. COVID-19 has caused consumers to allocate a higher share of wallet to consumer electronics. After the pandemic, consumers might shift their spending back towards categories or industries that were affected by the pandemic and away from consumer electronic categories. In addition, the pandemic has caused some products and services to be in high demand, and we may not be able to meet this demand in all of our categories due to product shortages or decisions by our vendors to allocate products to certain customers due to the circumstances resulting from the pandemic, and our vendors may increase prices, each of which may adversely impact our revenue and profitability. The pandemic has, and may continue to, negatively impact our products and services that historically have been more likely to be purchased in a physical store than online.  Risks Related to Operations: The pandemic has forced us to make a number of operational changes. Although we continue to offer a contactless, curbside model for those who prefer to shop that way, we could be required to return to a curbside-only model or close stores due to the current or future resurgence of the pandemic. Our ability to continue to sell our products and services is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety of our customers and those employees who are needed to work at our stores and distribution facilities. Failure to maintain the recommended or required safety standards as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local governments could also result in an increased risk of regulatory action or civil litigation. The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our customers and employees, these measures may not be successful, and we may be required to temporarily close distribution centers or stores from time to time, halt certain services or take other measures. Also, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future. Additionally, while we have continued to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and customers as we continue to operate during the pandemic, we face an increased risk of litigation related to our operating environments. Preparing for and responding to the continuing pandemic could divert management’s attention from our key strategic priorities; increase costs as we prioritize health and safety matters for our employees and customers; cause us to reduce, delay, alter or abandon initiatives that may otherwise increase our long-term value; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. Risks Related to Profitability: To the extent COVID-19 continues to cause fundamental shifts in the channels in which customers choose to engage us, our profitability and our profitability rate may be adversely impacted. For example, at various times in fiscal 2021, we continued to pay rent for a number of physical stores that were closed and not generating sales (and we may need to do so again in the future), our online mix of products and services generally produces lower gross profit rates than in-store sales, and we offer some products and services that historically are more likely to be purchased in a physical store than online. We also do not offer or have limited digital and online offerings for certain products and services that have higher profitability rates. To the extent we are not able to maintain or increase the level of customer traffic in our stores or maintain or enable a more profitable mix of sales in our digital and online channels, our profitability and profitability rates may be materially negatively impacted. We have also incurred additional costs due to the operational changes we have made in response to the pandemic, and these costs have adversely impacted our profitability. As a result of disruptions to our supply chain, primarily due to mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured, we are experiencing, and may continue to experience, increased costs for shipping and transportation resources. If we are unable to manage these costs and supply chain disruptions, our profitability may be adversely impacted. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we could experience a longer-term impact on our costs, for example, the need for enhanced health and hygiene requirements in one or more regions in attempts to counteract future outbreaks. In the event of decreased store traffic, certain of our stores may not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, which could adversely affect the value of our owned and leased properties, potentially requiring us to record more significant non-cash impairment charges in future periods. 8 Risks Related to Our Debt and Global Financing Markets: Although we repaid in full the amounts we had borrowed under our revolving credit facility during fiscal 2021, we may find it necessary to increase our cash position and our short-term debt in the future in response to further resurgences of COVID-19. In the event we are required to raise capital, our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our prospects, our credit ratings, and our business and industry outlook. There is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or will be available on terms consistent with our expectations.  COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we have identified in this section, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Further, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, the effects of COVID-19, may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results. To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example: • whether or not they make a purchase;• their choice of brand, model or price-point;• how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and• their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans). Real GDP growth, consumer confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. Geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Future outbreaks, epidemics and/or pandemics could adversely impact our operating results. The risk of or actual occurrence of national, international or global outbreaks, epidemics, and/or pandemics, could have a material adverse impact on our business, including but not limited to, our sales and customer demand, operations and supply chain, financial results, capital financing or other financing activities and all other stated risks identified in these risk factors. Catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results. The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may be caused by, for example: • natural disasters or extreme weather events;• diseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners;• floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers; or• terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts. In recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets. Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. They can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders.  Further, external social activism, tension and violence resulting from external events impacting social justice and inequality, and our position and response to them, may adversely affect our employees, customers, properties and the communities in which we operate. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences. We operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. This manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles. 9 This rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. In addition, consumer preferences may be influenced even further as the social and economic environment navigates through the COVID-19 pandemic. These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Strategic Risks  We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability. While we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us. The retail sector has experienced an immense increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, as well as online sales for both in-store or curbside pick-up. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-cost or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins. As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability. If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. In addition, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability. Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include, for example, employee engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations. We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our increase in the starting hourly wage for all domestic employees implemented in fiscal 2021, as well as continued market pressure to increase employee hourly wage rates, increased cost pressure on employer-provided benefits. Our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material adverse impact to the profitability of our business. Our strategy to expand into new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks. As we introduce new products and services, using new technologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues. For example, as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology, we are subject to privacy and information security rules, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and/or subject to increased potential liability risk. This expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise. In fiscal 2021 we continued to invest in our health strategy and our underlying purpose to enrich lives through technology. The new health-related services offered might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of these services. In addition, the services and systems used could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system interruption risks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 10 Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation. We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example: • pressure on services attachment as a result of the sustained increase in consumer desire to purchase product offerings online and through mobile applications;• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises;• pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs;• increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;• employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the privacy of the data they hold; • the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake;• the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and catastrophic events; and• increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services. Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability. We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2021 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 80% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, LG and Sony - representing approximately 57% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition for those products. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms. We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers may also serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focus on consumer experience. We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. Operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. External factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability. We are subject to risks associated with company transformation. Our transformational activities within the organization are necessary to fully support our strategic vision for future customer and income growth, including our Building the New Blue Strategy, and any decreased capability to undertake those activities may have a material adverse impact on achieving that strategy. 11 Any limitations in organizational, financial or operational infrastructure could decrease our ability to realize transformational objectives supporting our key strategic initiatives relating to our development of competitive advantages, creating solutions for customers and providing differentiated value. If we do not have access to, or fail to dedicate, the appropriate people, management focus and resources to implementing these transformational objectives, our long-term growth and profitability could be adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has further demonstrated the necessity for transformation, and as a result, has increased pressure on the timeline of these activities. The increased pressure to transform quickly and accelerate the implementation of the strategy could have an adverse impact on the overall implementation performance of these objectives and our long-term growth and profitability. As an example, we have seen that our online mix of products and services generally produces lower profit margins than in-store sales. Therefore, the continued transformation to a more digitally-driven business after COVID-19 could put sustained pressure on our costs and profitability. Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business. We may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, ""new ventures""). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty, and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example: • different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments;• failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;• uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;• failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;• failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;• failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;• unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;• disputes or strategic differences with other third-party participants in the new venture; and• adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture. If new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business. Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results. Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased, of which some are subject to long-term leases. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example: • changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving multi-channel environment;• the location and appropriate number of stores, supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio;• the interior layout, format and size of our stores;• the products and services we offer at each store;• the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;• the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store; and• the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents. If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example: • closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;• incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;• operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and• bearing excessive lease expenses. These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity. For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are typically still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant. 12 Operational Risks Interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business. Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors' abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, at the right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to: • interruptions to our delivery capabilities;• failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;• disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;• limitations in capacity;• consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;• labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;• diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns;• damages or other loss to products; • increasing transportation costs; and • the COVID-19 pandemic and disruptions as a result of efforts to control or mitigate the pandemic (such as facility closures, governmental orders, outbreaks, and/or transportation capacity). It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability. We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationship or their services may have an adverse impact on our business. We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, delivery and installation, technical support, transportation and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationships with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods. Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Best Buy Essentials, Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, as well as products such as Jitterbug and Lively branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results: • we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brands product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;• we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brands products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;• we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to COVID-19, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural disasters;• we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brands products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;• we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return-to-vendor rights;• we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacturing of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;• we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brands products;• our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply;• we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brands products or manufacturing processes; and• regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country-of-origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.13  Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brands products and the profits we are able to generate from them. We are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S. Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including COVID-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation. We face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. We utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation. Further, as our online sales have increased and have become critical to our growth, and as we have shifted to remote working arrangements for many employees, the risk of any interruption of our information technology system capabilities is heightened, as well as the risk that customer demand exceeds the capacity of our online operations. Any such interruption or capacity constraint could result in a deterioration of our ability to process online sales, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.  Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions. Our business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which transmit information for a variety of activities. We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems. While we engage in significant data-protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims. Sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships. 14 Increasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, new laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, are expanding our obligations to protect the privacy and security of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. As an employer of approximately 102,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example: • the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board frequently considers;• laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and• laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide. Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability. Regulatory and Legal Risks We are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to: • the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;• the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;• the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;• the financial, operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security; • the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;• the impact of litigation trends, including class-action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and• the impact of the transition in presidential administrations and changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies, such as economic, fiscal, tax, retail, labor and social policies. The impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of tariffs or other trade actions that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects, as we did in fiscal 2020. Further, the impact of potential changes in U.S. or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, including additional guidance and legislation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters. 15 Further, as the COVID-19 pandemic and community spread of the virus continues to persist, we will continue to face risk and uncertainty as it relates to state and local government orders, which may restrict how we do business and potentially impact our performance and profitability. Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate. We operate retail locations in Canada, and during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we made the decision to exit our operations in Mexico. In addition, most of our exclusive brands products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Barbados, Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius and the U.K. During fiscal 2021 our International segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example: • political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;• economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;• rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;• government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events;• cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;• different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; • difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations; and• risks we may encounter in exiting our operations in Mexico. These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs. Financial and Market Risks Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors' because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our hourly pay structure, our differentiated service offerings or our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives. We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, during fiscal 2021, we extended the holiday shopping season starting in mid-October, while closing stores on Thanksgiving Day. These changes could bring additional unknown risks related to the sales performance of the holiday shopping season. As a result of these factors, there is risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected. Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2021 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs.16 In addition, we may experience pressure from lower profit-sharing revenue related to our private label and co-branded credit card arrangements, as the economic ramifications of COVID-19 may lead to higher credit card defaults over time, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability. Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities, and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs. Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. Failure to meet any financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we may provide to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. When we provide guidance, we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, but such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce any guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline"
15,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2020-03-23,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. Each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability. While we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us. The retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins. As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability. Our strategy to expand into new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks. As we introduce new products and services, using new technologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues. For example, as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology, we may be subject to privacy and information security rules, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and/or subject to increased potential liability risk. This expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise. In fiscal 2020, we continued to invest in our health strategy and our underlying purpose to enrich lives through technology. The new health-related services offered might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of these services. In addition, the services and systems used could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks, as well as business or system interruption risks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation. We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example: • increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises;• pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs;• increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;• employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and privacy of the data they hold; • the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake;7Table of Contents  • the risk that in-home services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather, health and safety concerns, and catastrophic events; and• increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services. We are subject to risks associated with company transformation. Our transformational activities within the organization are necessary to fully support our strategic vision for future customer and income growth, including our Building the New Blue strategy, and any decreased capability to undertake those activities may have a material impact on achieving that strategy. Any limitations in organizational, financial or operational infrastructure could decrease our ability to realize transformational objectives supporting our key strategic initiatives relating to our development of competitive advantages, creating solutions for customers and providing differentiated value. If we do not have access to, or fail to dedicate, the appropriate people, management focus and resources to implementing these transformational objectives, our long-term growth and profitability could be adversely affected. Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability. We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2020, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG - representing approximately 56% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms. We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of contracts, upgrade terms, qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability. Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee engagement, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations. We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Market increases to employee hourly wage rates, increased cost pressure on employer-provided benefits, and our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material impact to the profitability of our business. We are subject to statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include, but are not limited to: • the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;• the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;• the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;8Table of Contents  • the financial, operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA"");  • the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; contracted worker labor laws; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services; and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;• the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters; and• the impact of the general election on the development, or changes in, laws, regulations and policies. With respect to the CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, the statute provides new privacy rights for California residents and requires companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, allowing them to opt out of certain uses of their personal information. In addition, the California Attorney General has issued proposed rules under the CCPA. We cannot predict the impact of this first-of-its-kind statute and these rules that have not yet been finalized, in addition to potential privacy and security legislation in other states and the U.S. federal level, on our business or operations, but these legislative initiatives may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, interfere with intended business operations or lead us to incur incremental expenses in an effort to comply. The impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China could lead to the imposition of tariffs that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects, as we did in fiscal 2020. Further, the impact of potential changes in U.S. or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, including additional guidance and legislation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters. Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, the effects of novel coronavirus disease (“COVID 19”) may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results. To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example: • whether or not they make a purchase;• their choice of brand, model or price-point;• how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and• their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans). Real GDP growth, consumer confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic discussed in the following risk factor, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. Geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact the macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. The impact of COVID-19 is expected to adversely affect our business and our financial results. Concerns have rapidly grown regarding the outbreak of COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine have increased, which will adversely affect traffic to our stores. In particular, we recently announced a shift to enhanced curbside service only for all of our stores on an interim basis. Further, all in-home installation and repair has been temporarily suspended and all in-home consultations are being conducted virtually. The significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores caused by COVID-19 will likely result in a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects. We may further restrict the operations of our stores and distribution facilities if we deem this necessary or if recommended or mandated by authorities and these measures could have a further material impact on our sales and profits. Also, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future. COVID-19 also impacted our supply chain for products we sell, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured. We could also see significant disruptions to our supply chain in the U.S. as well as significant deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending. In addition, we expect to incur significant costs in our response to the pandemic, including, but not limited to, costs incurred to 9Table of Contents implement the operational changes described above and certain payments to or other costs relating to employees who are not working during the pandemic. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results will also depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain. Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors' because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our differential service offerings or our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives. We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation. Our information technology systems could also be adversely affected by changes that result from COVID-19, including for example, a significant increase in remote working of our employees and an increase in online orders due to restrictions on our retail operations.    We also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation. Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions. Our business involves the collection, use and storage of personal information, including payment card information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which transmit information for a variety of activities. We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems. While we engage in significant data-protection efforts, criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data, or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims. Sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships. Increasing costs associated with information security and privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud, and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, new laws, such as the CCPA, are expanding our obligations to protect the privacy and security of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. 10Table of Contents  Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business. We may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, ""new ventures""). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example: • different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments;• failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;• uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;• failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;• failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;• failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;• unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;• disputes or strategic differences with other third-party participants in the new venture; and• adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture. If new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business. We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity, new product release activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected. Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences. We operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. This manifests itself in a variety of ways: the emergence of new products and categories, rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles. This rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation. These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2020 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs. Interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business. Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors' abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include, but are not limited to: 11Table of Contents  • interruptions to our delivery capabilities;• failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;• disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;• limitations in capacity;• consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;• labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;• diseases, pandemics (including COVID-19), outbreaks and other health-related concerns, which have resulted in and could continue to result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;• damages or other loss to products; and• increasing transportation costs.  It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability. Catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results. The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may be caused by, for example: • natural disasters or extreme weather events;• diseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners;• floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers; or• terrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts. In recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain events in many of our markets. Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. They can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focused consumer experience approach. We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. Operational factors, such as failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions, could damage our reputation. External factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. As an employer of nearly 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example: • the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board continually considers;• laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and• laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.12Table of Contents   Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability. Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results. Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased, of which some are subject to long-term leases. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example: • changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving multi-channel environment;• the location and appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;• the interior layout, format and size of our stores;• the products and services we offer at each store;• the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;• the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store;• the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents; and• our supply chain service location network strategy. If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example: • closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;• incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;• operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and• bearing excessive lease expenses. These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity. For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant. Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing, our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs. Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies. We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationship or their services might have an impact to our business. We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including, but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, delivery and installation, technical support, transportation and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods. 13Table of Contents  Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, as well as other products such as Jitterbug, Lively Mobile and Lively Mobile Plus, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results: • we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;• we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;• we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to COVID-19, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers, other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural disasters;• we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;• we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return to vendor rights;• we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;• we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;• our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs, including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with China, and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply;• we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and• regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation. Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them. We are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S. Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics (including COVID-19) and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate. We operate retail locations in Canada and Mexico. In addition, most of our exclusive brand products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Barbados, Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius and the U.K. During fiscal 2020, our International segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example: • political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;• economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;• rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;• government-imposed travel restrictions or warnings, whether in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events;• cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;• different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and• difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations.14Table of Contents   These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs. Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline"
8,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2019-03-28,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
.Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. Each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.While we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value, the retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us.The retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be 7Table of Contentscompetitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins.As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.Our strategy to expand into new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks.As we introduce new products and services, using new technologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer market segments and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions, failures or other issues. For example, as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology, we may be subject to privacy and information security rules, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and/or subject to increased potential liability risk.This expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management, employees, operations, systems, technical expertise, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise.As a part of our strategy to enrich lives through technology, we are entering the health area, growing organically as well as inorganically. In fiscal 2019 we acquired GreatCall, which provides emergency concierge and monitoring services to subscribed customers. Such services might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of our services. In addition, the services and systems used could expose us to customer data information security as well as business or system interruption risks. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support, and health, safety and caregiving monitoring and support. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example:•increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises, which may be higher than the related revenue;•increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;•unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses;•employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;•the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;•employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold; •the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they withtake, and for compliance with building codes and related regulations; and•increased risk of non-compliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services.Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2019, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 64% of the merchandise we purchased (70% in fiscal 2018), with five suppliers - Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG - representing approximately 51% of total merchandise purchased (56% in fiscal 2018). We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value 8Table of Contentsand depend upon, to varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages - for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brands with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers - to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition. In addition, vendors may decide to cease allowing us to offer certain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms.We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry. For example, if carriers change the structure of customer contracts, customer upgrade terms, customer qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels.If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high-quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry, may negatively impact our operations.We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Market increases to field employee hourly wage rates, along with our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and wage rates, could have a material impact to the profitability of our business.We are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:•the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;•the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;•ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;•the financial, operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA""). When it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, the regulation will provide new consumer data privacy rights for California residents and will require companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, allowing them to opt-out of certain uses of their personal information. However, legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the CCPA, and it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to the CCPA or how it will be interpreted. We cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur incremental expenses in an effort to comply.•the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial reform; National Labor Relations Board rule changes; healthcare reform; corporate governance matters; escheatment rules; rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment 9Table of Contentsservices; and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;•the impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products;•the impact of potential changes in U.S. or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, including additional guidance and legislation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and•the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters.Regulatory activity focused on the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters.Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:•whether or not they make a purchase;•their choice of brand, model or price-point;•how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and•their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans).Real GDP growth, consumer confidence, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. Geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned might also impact the macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. However, some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors' because of, for example, our extended retail footprint and structure, our differential service offerings or our levels of customer service. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives.We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business.The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information.Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions), catastrophic events (such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes) and usage errors by our employees. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.We also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks, other technical difficulties or 10Table of Contentsevents outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation.Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions.Our business involves the collection, use and storage of customer information, including payment card information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which transmit customer information for a variety of activities. While we take significant steps to protect this information, external criminal activity, such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures and unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims.Sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships.Increasing costs associated with information security and customer data privacy, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud, and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, new laws, like the General Data Protection Regulation and CCPA, are expanding company obligations to protect the privacy of customer data, requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk of potential breach. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.We may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, ""new ventures""). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:•different and incremental business risks of the new venture;•failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;•uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;•failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;•failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;•failure to generate expected synergies, such as cost reductions;•unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;•disputes or strategic differences with other third-party participants in the new venture; and•adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.If new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business.We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it 11Table of Contentsdifficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments, such as natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, cyber-attacks, failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.We operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption. This manifests itself in a variety of ways: emergence of new products and categories, rapid maturation of categories, cannibalization of categories, declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles.This rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage, and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include: failure to offer the products and services that our customers want; having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation; inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply; delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and damage to our brand and reputation.These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2019 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits or losses of the programs.Interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business.Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors' abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include:•interruptions to our delivery capabilities;•failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;•disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems;•limitations in capacity;•consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;•labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;•damages or other loss to products; and•increasing transportation costs. It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.12Table of ContentsCatastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results.The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may be caused by, for example:•natural disasters or extreme weather events;•diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees, customers or partners;•floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties; or•terrorism, civil unrest or other conflicts.In recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain events in many of our markets. Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. They can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition. We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success. Operational factors such as, for example, failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation. External factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in revenues and customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability.Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model.As an employer of nearly 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example:•the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, changes to which the National Labor Relations Board continually considers;•laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and•laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability.In addition, although as of February 2, 2019, none of our U.S. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements, any future organizing activity could adversely affect our costs and our results of operations.13Table of ContentsFailure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are leased, of which some are subject to long-term leases. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example:•changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving multi-channel environment;•the location and appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;•the interior layout, format and size of our stores;•the products and services we offer at each store;•the local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;•the primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store;•the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents; and•our supply chain service location network strategy.If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:•closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;•incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;•operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and•bearing excessive lease expenses.These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing, our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs.Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.14Table of ContentsWe utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our operations, and any material disruption in our relationship or their services might have an impact to our business.We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, delivery and installation, technical support, transportation and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results.Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Dynex, Insignia, Modal, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results:•we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;•we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions, such as product recalls;•we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers or unforeseen natural disasters;•we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;•we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return to vendor rights;•we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;•we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;•our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply;•we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and•regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them.We are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the U.S.Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Risks such as political or economic instability, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, and may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies.These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.15Table of ContentsOur international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.We operate retail locations in Canada and Mexico. In addition, most of our exclusive brand products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. We also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Barbados, Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius, Turks and Caicos and the U.K. During fiscal 2019, our International segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:•political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;•economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules, as well as foreign exchange rate risk;•rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;•cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;•different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;•difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and•difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations.These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs.Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline"
13,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2018-04-02,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
.Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. Each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers that offer their products and services directly to customers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.The retail sector is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers that offer products directly to consumers. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us, have greater brand recognition and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time. They may also be able to secure better terms from vendors and devote more resources to technology, fulfillment and marketing. Competition may also result from new entrants in the markets we serve, offering products and/or services that compete with us.The retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not generally required to collect sales taxes in certain U.S. states, which can negatively impact the ability of multi-channel retailers to be price competitive on a tax-included basis. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, puts pressure on our margins. As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.7Table of ContentsMany of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.In general, consumer electronics product life cycles (which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence) have become shorter and less predictable. This is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers. Consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change, and this adds to the unpredictability of our business. These factors affect us in a number of ways, for example:•the emergence of new products and categories (for example, voice assistants);•the rapid maturity and decline of relatively new categories (for example, tablets);•cannibalization of categories (for example, the effect of smartphones on demand for GPS, mobile audio, digital imaging devices, etc.);•increasing demand for internet-based services that may replace physical products such as hard drives, media and entertainment software products;•intense consumer interest in high-profile product updates (for example, smartphone model updates), which concentrates purchasing activity around new launch dates and can often lead to shortages of merchandise;•unpredictable consumer adoption rates (for example, contrasting adoption rates of 3D and Ultra-HD televisions);•rapidly declining price-points in many categories (for example, digital imaging, Ultra-HD televisions, etc.); and•availability of content (for example, Ultra-HD programming, online streaming services, sporting events or other broadcast programming).The effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and prices. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include:•failure to offer the products and services that our customers want;•having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation;•inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply;•delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and•damage to our brand and reputation.These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2018, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70% of the merchandise we purchased (77% in fiscal 2017), with 5 suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and Lenovo – representing approximately 56% of total merchandise purchased (53% in fiscal 2017). We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. To varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages — for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brand with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers — to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues, consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships.We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business. For example, if carriers change the structure of customer contracts, customer upgrade terms, customer qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. Carriers may decide to cease allowing us to offer their contracts or certain categories of their contracts, focus their marketing efforts on alternative 8Table of Contentschannels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms. Each of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.We have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet. Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design, production or distribution facilities, may reduce their customer incentives, advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies. These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged. Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches in laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation. Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, design, delivery, installation, set-up, protection plans, repair, technical support and educational classes. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example:•increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises, which may be higher than the related revenue;•increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services;•unpredictable warranty failure rates and related expenses;•employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;•the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;•employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold; and•the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation, and the potential responsibility for the actions they take, and for compliance with building codes and related regulations.In addition, as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions, it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings, which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services. If, for these or other reasons, we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers’ expectations in the execution of these services, our reputation, revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:•whether or not they make a purchase;•their choice of brand, model or price-point;•how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and•their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans).Real GDP growth, consumer confidence, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and 9Table of Contentsfood and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers' demand for the products and services that we offer. Our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors.Interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business. Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors' ability to deliver products to us at the right location, right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include:•interruptions to our delivery capabilities;•failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;•disruptions to our systems and implementation of new systems;•limitations in capacity;•consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;•labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;•damages or other loss to products; and•costs that are excessive.It is important that we be able to maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands. Any disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of e-commerce increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry, may negatively impact our operations. Our strategy to expand into new products, services and technologies brings new business, financial and regulatory risks.As we introduce new products and services, using new technologies and applications, we may have limited experience in these newer market segments, and our customers may not like our new value propositions. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues. In addition, this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions. In addition, new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected, which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise.Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition.We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success. Operational factors such as, for example, failure to deliver high quality services, uncompetitive pricing, failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation. 10Table of ContentsExternal factors, such as negative public remarks or accusations, could also be damaging. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability.Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. Failure to identify and lease suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability. Most of our properties are subject to long-term leases. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example:•changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving multi-channel environment;•the appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;•the formats and sizes of our stores;•the locations of our stores;•the interior layouts of our stores;•the products and services we offer at each store;•the trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;•the local competitive positioning in and around our stores;•the primary term lease commitment for each store;•the long-term lease option coverage for each store;•the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents;•our supply chain network strategy; and•our ongoing network of service locations.If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:•closing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;•incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;•operating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and•bearing excessive lease expenses.These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are still responsible for taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors' because of, for example, our differential service offerings or levels of customer service. As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives.Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able 11Table of Contentsto pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit, our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities, and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs. Our credit ratings and outlooks at March 29, 2018, are summarized below. In fiscal 2018, Fitch Ratings Limited affirmed its long-term credit rating of BBB- and changed its outlook from Stable to Positive. In fiscal 2019, Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded its long-term credit rating of BBB- to BBB and changed its outlook from Positive to Stable, and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. affirmed its long-term credit rating of Baa1 with a Stable outlook.Rating AgencyRating OutlookStandard & Poor'sBBB StableMoody'sBaa1 StableFitchBBB- PositiveAny future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.  Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments such as natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues, failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.We may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, ""new ventures""). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:•different and incremental business risks of the new venture;•failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;•uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;•failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;•failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;•failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions;•unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;•disputes or strategic differences with other third-party participants in the new venture; and•adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.12Table of ContentsIf new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business. Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer, employee, vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions.Our business involves the collection, use and storage of customer information, including payment card information, as well as confidential information regarding our employees, vendors and other company information. We also share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, as well as use third-party technology and systems which transmit customer information for a variety of activities. While we take significant steps to protect this information, third party criminal activity such as cyber-attacks, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties, may undermine our privacy and security measures and unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them. Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs, penalties and claims.Sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair. Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced, including our exclusive brands, may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security. Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture, sell and service may not be effective, resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships.Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business.The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors. We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information.Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks and other malicious actions), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.We also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. If we do not continually invest in securing these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware, software, network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions and delays. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks, other technical difficulties or events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data, could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services, which could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation.Catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results.The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may be caused by, for example:13Table of Contents•natural disasters or extreme weather events;•diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees, customers or partners;•floods, fire or other catastrophes affecting our properties; •cybersecurity breaches; or•terrorism, civil unrest or other conflicts.Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. They can also affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Insignia, Modal, Dynex, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results:•we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;•we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls;•we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers or unforeseen natural disasters;•we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;•we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;•we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;•we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and•regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them. We are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:•the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;•the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;•ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport;•the impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, whether imposed as a result of increased cyber-security risks or otherwise;14Table of Contents•the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial reform, National Labor Relations Board rule changes, health care reform, corporate governance matters, escheatment rules, rules governing pricing, content, distribution, copyright, mobile communications, electronic device certification or payment services, and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;•the impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products;•the impact of potential changes in U.S. or other countries' tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws, including additional guidance and legislation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and•the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters.Regulatory activity focused on the retail sector has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters. Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. As an employer of approximately 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example: •unionization and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, the organization of unions and union elections; in the U.S., the National Labor Relations Board continually considers changes to such regulations; as of February 3, 2018, none of our U.S. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements;•laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and•laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability.Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 24% of our fiscal 2018 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income from our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs. We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our business operations. We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, delivery and installation, technical support, transportation and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.15Table of ContentsOur international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.  We operate retail locations in Canada and Mexico. In addition, we have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Bermuda, China, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius, Turks and Caicos and the U.K. During fiscal 2018, our International segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:•political conditions and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism;•economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules;•legal and regulatory environments;•rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;•risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates;•cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;•different rules or practices regarding employee relations, including the existence of works councils or unions;•difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and•difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations. These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs.Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline"
2,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2017-03-24,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
.Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and, consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers that offer their products and services directly to customers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.The retail business is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers that offer products directly to consumers. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time. The retail industry continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all U.S. states, which can negatively impact the ability of multi-channel retailers to be price competitive on a tax-included basis. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, puts pressure on our margins.As these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences.7Table of ContentsIn general, consumer electronics product life cycles (which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence) have become shorter and less predictable. This is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers. Consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change, and this adds to the unpredictability of our business. These factors affect us in a number of ways, for example:•the emergence of new products and categories (for example, virtual reality);•the rapid maturity and decline of relatively new categories (for example, tablets);•cannibalization of categories (for example, the effect of smart phones on demand for GPS, mobile audio, digital imaging devices, etc.);•intense consumer interest in high-profile product updates (for example, smartphone model updates) which concentrates purchasing activity around new launch dates and can often lead to shortages of merchandise;•unpredictable consumer adoption rates (for example, contrasting adoption rates of 3D and Ultra-HD televisions);•rapidly declining price-points in many categories (for example, digital imaging, Ultra-HD televisions, etc.); and•availability of content (for example, Ultra-HD programming, online streaming services, sporting events or other broadcast programming).The effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and price. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include:•not offering the products and services that our customers want;•having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation;•not securing adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply;•delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and•damage to our brand and reputation.These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2017, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 77% of the merchandise we purchased (75% in fiscal 2016), with 5 suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Sony, Hewlett-Packard, and LG Electronics – representing approximately 53% of total merchandise purchased (51% in fiscal 2016). We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. To varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages -- for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brand with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers -- to our commercial disadvantage. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues, consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships.We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business. For example, if carriers change the structure of customer contracts, customer upgrade terms, customer qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenues and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. Carriers may decide to cease allowing us to offer their contracts or certain categories of their contracts, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms. Each of these factors could have a materially adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.We have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet. Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards of quality and safety can be difficult, especially with respect 8Table of Contentsto goods sourced from outside the U.S. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, work stoppages, port delays, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other related issues could materially adversely affect our financial results. Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety and quality,  we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged.  Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches in laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation.  Recalls of products, particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products, could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings, including consultation, design, delivery, installation, set-up, protection plans, repair, technical support and educational classes. Designing, marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example:•increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises, which may be higher than the related revenue;•unpredictable warranty failure rates and related expenses;•employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes, which may increase our scope of liability;•the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings;•employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold; and•the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they take and for compliance with building codes and related regulations.In addition, as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions, it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings, which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services. If, for these or other reasons, we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers’ expectations in the execution of these services, our reputation, revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:•whether or not they make a purchase;•their choice of brand, model or price-point;•how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and•their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans).Consumer confidence, inflation, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers' demand for the products and services that we offer. Our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors.Interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our business. Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of recent industry trends and initiatives such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast and free delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors' ability to deliver 9Table of Contentsproducts to us at the right location, right time and in the right quantities. We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network. The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include:•interruptions to our delivery capabilities;•failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments;•disruptions to our systems and implementation of new systems;•limitations in capacity;•consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors;•labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;•damages or other loss to products; and•costs that are excessive.The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries, because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The continuing growth of e-commerce increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices. Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers, availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations. Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition.We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, declines in customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues, all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability.Our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies. We operate in a highly-competitive and ever-changing commercial environment. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategies within this environment. Strategies that have proved successful in the past may not be successful in the future. Our current strategy includes continuous improvement of our business and the pursuit of new growth opportunities. It is possible that our strategies may be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in the future. It is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies or that they expose us to additional risks. Our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to develop and execute appropriate strategies. The market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information regarding our strategies.Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.10Table of ContentsEffective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multi-channel strategy. Most of our properties are subject to long-term leases. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example:•changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omni-channel environment;•the appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;•the formats and sizes of our stores;•the locations of our stores;•the interior layouts of our stores;•the trade area demographics and economic data of each of our stores;•the local competitive positioning in and around our stores;•the primary term lease commitment for each store;•the long-term lease option coverage for each store;•the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents;•our supply chain network strategy; and•our ongoing network of service locations.If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:•having to close stores and abandon the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;•incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;•having stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and•bearing excessive lease expenses.These consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are still responsible for the maintenance, taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessor. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors, because of, for example, our differential service offerings or levels of customer service. As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce cost and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives.Our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms. We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities, and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs. 11Table of ContentsOur credit ratings and outlooks at March 20, 2017, are summarized below. In fiscal 2017, Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded its long-term credit rating from BB+ to BBB- with a Stable outlook; Moody's Investors Service, Inc. affirmed its long-term credit rating of Baa1 with a Stable outlook; and Fitch Ratings Limited affirmed its long-term credit rating of BBB- with a Stable outlook.Rating Agency Rating OutlookStandard & Poor's BBB- StableMoody's Baa1 StableFitch BBB- StableAny future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.  Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns, which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly. Unexpected events or developments such as natural or man-made disasters, economic factors, product sourcing issues, failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected.Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.We may decide to enter into new joint ventures, partnerships, alliances or acquisitions with third parties (collectively, ""new ventures""). Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors, including, for example:•different and incremental business risks of the new venture;•failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture;•uncertainty of forecasting financial performance;•failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business, such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems;•failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting;•failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions;•unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture;•disputes or strategic differences with other third party participants in the new venture; and•adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture.If new ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired. New ventures may also divert our financial resources and management's attention from other important areas of our business. Failure to protect or effectively respond to breach of the integrity, security and confidentiality of our employee and customer data could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our employees or customers.The use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business, our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. We are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information. Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, the costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other 12Table of Contentsconfidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we take significant steps to protect this information, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties or failure to effectively respond to such compromises, may undermine our security measures. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may not prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationship with our employees, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue, and may expose us to material costs, penalties and compensation claims. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. Catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results.The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Such events may be caused by, for example:•natural disasters or extreme weather events;•diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees, customers or partners;•floods, fire or other catastrophes affecting our properties; or•terrorism, civil unrest or other conflicts.Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Insignia, Modal, Dynex, Init, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeastern Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could materially adversely affect our operating results:•we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;•we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls;•we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers or unforeseen natural disasters;•we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;•we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;•we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;•we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and•regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them. 13Table of ContentsWe are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations. Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:•the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;•the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;•ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulation related to product safety and product transport;•the impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, whether imposed as a result of increased cyber-security risks or otherwise;•the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform, National Labor Relations Board rule changes, health care reform, corporate governance matters, escheatment rules and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;•the impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products;•the impact of potential changes in U.S. or other countries tax laws and regulations, including the imposition of the border adjustment tax on imported products as is currently being discussed by U.S. Congress that could increase the cost of the products we sell because a significant portion of the products we sell in the U.S. are sourced from outside of the country; and•the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters.Regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters. Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. As an employer of approximately 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example: •unionization and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, the organization of unions and union elections; in the U.S. the National Labor Relations Board continually considers changes to such regulations; as of January 28, 2017, none of our U.S. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements;•laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and•laws that impact minimum wage, sick time, paid leave and scheduling requirements, that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and our profitability.Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases. Approximately 23% of our fiscal 2017 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income from our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt 14Table of Contentsrates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs. We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, website offerings, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate (whether from internal or external factors), or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could significantly disrupt our business and cause, for example, higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.We utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels, malicious attacks or other technical difficulties, could cause us to forgo material revenues, incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation with consumers.  We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our business operations. We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, technical support, transportation and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.  We operate retail locations in Canada and Mexico. In addition, we have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Bermuda, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius, Turks and Caicos, and the U.K. During fiscal 2017, our International segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:•political conditions;•economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules;•legal and regulatory environments;•rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities;•risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates;•cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;•difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and•difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations. These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead to us incurring material impairments and other exit costs.Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. If our financial results for a particular period 15Table of Contentsdo not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline"
7,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2016-03-23,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
.Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers, who offer their products and services directly to customers, which directly affects our revenue and profitability.The retail business is highly competitive. Price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers and technology service providers, as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers who offer products directly to consumers. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time. The retail industry continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all U.S. states, which can negatively impact the ability of multi-channel retailers to be price competitive on a tax-included basis. Online and multi-channel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins. Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, puts pressure on our margins.7Table of ContentsAs these and related competitive factors evolve, we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability.Consumer electronics products are highly susceptible to technological advancement and changes in consumer preferences.In general, consumer electronics product life cycles (which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence) have become shorter and less predictable. This is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers. Consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change and this adds to the unpredictability of our business. These factors affect us in a number of ways, for example:•the emergence of new products and categories (for example, wearable devices);•the rapid maturity and decline of relatively new categories (for example, tablets);•cannibalization of categories (for example, the effect of smart phones on demand for GPS, mobile audio, digital imaging devices, etc.);•intense consumer interest in high-profile product updates (for example, smartphone model updates) which concentrates purchasing activity around new launch dates;•unpredictable consumer adoption rates (for example, contrasting adoption rates of 3D and Ultra-HD televisions);•rapidly declining price-points in many categories (for example, digital imaging, Ultra-HD televisions, etc.); and•availability of content (for example, Ultra-HD programming, online streaming services, sporting events or other broadcast programming).The effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and price. If we fail to interpret, predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner, the consequences can include:•not offering the products and services that our customers want;•having excess inventory, which may require heavy discounting or liquidation;•not securing adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply;•delays in adapting our merchandising, marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends; and•damage to our brand and reputation.These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability.We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2016, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 75% of the merchandise we purchased (73% in fiscal 2015), with 5 suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG Electronics – representing approximately 51% of total merchandise purchased (47% in fiscal 2015). We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or any other terms. Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for various forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties. To varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages -- for example, their financial strength, the strength of their brand with customers, their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers -- to our commercial disadvantage, with a consequent adverse impact on our profitability. The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive retail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues, consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships.We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business. For example, if carriers change the structure of customer contracts, customer upgrade terms, customer qualification requirements, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenues and profitability. In addition, our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels. Carriers may decide to 8Table of Contentscease allowing us to offer their contracts, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms. Each of these potential factors could have a materially adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.We have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner can be a challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, port delays, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our financial results. Our focus on services as a strategic imperative exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.Our customer promises include provision of a full range of services to complement our product offerings, including consultation, design, delivery, installation, set-up, protection plans, repair, technical support and educational classes. These services can differentiate us from many of our competitors and provide an opportunity to deliver superior customer service while generating incremental revenue and profit. However, designing, marketing and executing these services successfully and consistently is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example:•increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises, which may be higher than the related revenue;•unpredictable warranty failure rates and related expenses;•employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes; these factors may increase our scope of liability related to our employees' actions;•employees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold; and•the engagement of third party contractors to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they take and for compliance with building codes and related regulations.In addition, as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions, it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings, which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services. If, for these or other reasons, we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers’ expectations in the execution of these services, our reputation, revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.Macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and key international markets could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.To varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers may be affected in many different ways, including, for example:•whether or not they make a purchase;•their choice of brand, model or price-point;•how frequently they upgrade their devices; and•their appetite for complementary services (for example, protection plans).Consumer confidence, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers' demand for the products and services that we offer. Our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors.Interruptions to our supply chain and other factors affecting our distribution may adversely affect our business.Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of recent industry trends and initiatives such as ship-from-store and the emphasis on fast and free delivery when purchasing online. We also depend on third parties for certain aspects of our supply chain network. In managing our supply chain we are exposed to the following risks, for example, which may not be fully controllable by us:•interruptions to our delivery capabilities;9Table of Contents•failure of third party companies to meet our standards or commitments;•disruptions to our systems and implementation of new systems;•limitations in capacity;•consolidation or other changes in the distribution market;•labor strikes or slow-downs impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain;•damages or other loss to products; and•costs that are excessive.The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries, because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business. The aforementioned channel shift increases our exposure to these risks. If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability.If we fail to attract, retain and engage appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees, including our executive team and other employees in key positions. Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations. Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition.We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success. The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty, decreases in gift card and service plan sales, lower employee retention and productivity, vendor relationship issues and other factors, all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability.Our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies. We operate in a highly-competitive and ever-changing commercial environment. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategies within this environment. Strategies that have proved successful in the past may not be successful in the future. Our current strategy includes transformational change to certain areas of our business and the pursuit of new growth opportunities. It is possible that our strategies may prove to be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in the future. It is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies or that they expose us to additional risks. Our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to develop and execute appropriate strategies. The market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information regarding our strategies.Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omni-channel strategy. We primarily secure properties through operating leases with third-party landlords. In light of the long-term nature of most of these commitments, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence our long-term real estate strategy. Such factors include, for example:•changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omni-channel environment;10Table of Contents•the appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;•the formats and sizes of our stores;•the locations of our stores;•the interior layouts of our stores;•the trade area demographics and economic data of each of our stores;•the local competitive positioning in and around our stores;•the primary term lease commitment for each store;•the long-term lease option coverage for each store;•the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents;•our supply chain network strategy; and•our ongoing network of service locations.If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors, fail to negotiate terms which keep us market competitive, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:•having to close stores and abandon the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the lease;•incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;•having stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and•bearing excessive lease expenses.These consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. We are still responsible for the maintenance, taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessor. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Some of our operating costs are fixed and/or are subject to multi-year contracts. Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors, because, for example, of our differential service offerings or levels of customer service. As discussed above, our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues. Accordingly, our ongoing drive to reduce cost and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative. Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives.Our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms. We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations, or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities, and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs. Our credit ratings and outlooks at January 30, 2016 are summarized below. In fiscal 2016, Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded its long-term credit rating from BB to BB+ with a Stable outlook. Moody's Investors Service, Inc. upgraded its long-term credit rating from Baa2 to Baa1 with a Stable outlook. Fitch Ratings Limited upgraded its long-term credit rating from BB to BBB- with a Stable outlook.11Table of ContentsRating Agency Rating OutlookStandard and Poor's BB+ StableMoody's Baa1 StableFitch BBB- StableAny future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk, and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.  Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition, the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors, such as the level of promotional activity and customer buying patterns, and forecasting and reacting to these factors quickly is difficult. Unexpected events or developments such as natural or man-made disasters, product sourcing issues, failure or interruption of management information systems, or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors could significantly disrupt our operations. As a result of these factors, there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results are adversely affected.Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.In the future, we may decide to enter into new ventures, alliances or acquisitions. Assessing a potential opportunity can be based on assumptions that might not ultimately prove to be correct. In addition, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential opportunity may be limited. The success of ventures, alliances or acquisitions is also largely dependent on the current and future participation, working relationship and strategic vision of the venture or alliance partners, which can change following a transaction. Integrating new businesses, stores or concepts can be difficult and risky. These types of transactions may divert our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities and may also negatively impact our return on invested capital. Entering into new ventures, alliances or acquisitions may also impair our relationships with our vendors or other strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate businesses that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures, or we may encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting. Failure to effectively integrate and manage strategic ventures, alliances and acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity and may require impairment of associated goodwill, tradenames or other assets. Failure to protect the integrity, security and confidentiality of our employee and customer data could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our employees or customers.The use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business, our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. We are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information. Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, the costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we take significant steps to protect this information, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may not prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationship with our employees, which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue, and may expose us to material costs, penalties and compensation claims. In addition, any compromise of our data 12Table of Contentssecurity may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. Natural disasters, changes in climate, geo-political events or other catastrophes could adversely affect our operating results.The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Such events may be caused by, for example:•natural disasters or extreme weather events;•diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees, customers or partners;•floods, fire or other catastrophes affecting our properties; or•terrorism, civil unrest or other conflicts.Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network. As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events, we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. Sales of our exclusive brands products, which include Insignia, Modal, Dynex, Init, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, represent an important component of our revenue. Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeastern Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could materially adversely affect our operating results:•we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;•we may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls;•we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key manufacturers or unforeseen natural disasters;•we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;•we are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;•we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;•we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and•regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them. We are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:•the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;13Table of Contents•the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;•ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture, including laws and regulation related to product safety and product transport;•the impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, whether imposed as a result of increased cyber-security risks or otherwise;•the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform, National Labor Relations Board rule changes, health care reform, corporate governance matters, escheatment rules and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;•the impact of changes in global tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards; and•the impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters.Regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters. Changes to the National Labor Relations Act or other labor-related statutes or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. As an employer of approximately 125,000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions, we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including, for example: •unionization and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations, the organization of unions and union elections; in the U.S. the National Labor Relations Board continually considers changes to such regulations; as of January 30, 2016, none of our U.S. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements;•laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors; and•laws that impact minimum wage and scheduling requirements, that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs and/or impact the level of service we are able to provide.Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue operations and thus our revenue and profitability.Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs. We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by third-party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We view our financing programs as a way to generate incremental revenue of products and services from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment. Approximately 21% of our fiscal 2016 revenue was transacted using one of the company's branded cards. In addition, we earn profit-share income from our banking partners based on the performance of the programs. The income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors, including the volume and value of transactions, the terms of promotional financing offers, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs. We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, services fulfillment, staff planning and deployment, website offerings, financial management, reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate (whether from internal or external factors), or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could significantly disrupt our business and cause, for example, higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.14Table of ContentsWe utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications. Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels or other technical difficulties, could cause us to forego material revenues and adversely affect our reputation with consumers.  We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our business operations. We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including but not limited to, information technology, web hosting and cloud-based services, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, gift cards, customer warranty, technical support and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods.Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.  We operate retail locations in Canada and Mexico. In addition, we have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries, including Bermuda, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Turks and Caicos, and the U.K. During fiscal 2016, our International segment's operations generated 8% of our revenue. In general, the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our International operations. In addition, our International operations also expose us to other risks, including those related to, for example:•political conditions;•economic conditions, including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules;•legal and regulatory environments;•rules governing international trade and ownership of foreign entities;•risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates;•cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately;•difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and•difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations. These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead to us incurring material impairments and other exit costs.Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forward-looking information for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline"
1,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2015-03-31,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
.Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. We face strong competition from traditional store-based retailers, multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses, our vendors and other forms of retail commerce, which directly affects our sales and margins.The retail business is highly competitive. Price is of primary importance to customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices to attract customers. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers, as well as certain of our vendors who offer their products directly to consumers. Some of our competitors have greater market presence and financial resources than we do. The retail industry continues to experience a trend toward an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications, and some online-only businesses are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all U.S. states, which can negatively impact the ability of multi-channel retailers to be price competitive. Online and multi-channel retailers are also increasing their focus on delivery services, with customers increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery cost depends on many factors, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products. In addition, because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service utilizing a multi-channel platform, our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors. Changes in the levels of these various competitive factors may have a significant impact on consumer demand for our products and services and the margins we can generate from them. Failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner could result in a decline in our sales.Our success depends on our vendors' and our ability to successfully introduce new products, services and technologies to consumers, including, among other factors, the frequency of product and service innovations, how accurately we predict consumer preferences, the level of consumer demand, the availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Consumers continue to have a wide variety of choices in terms of how and where they purchase the products and services we sell. Failure to accurately predict and adapt to constantly changing technology and consumer preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.Macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and key international markets could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.Some of our products and services are viewed by some consumers to be discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. Consumer confidence, employment levels, oil prices, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, and costs for items such as fuel and food, can adversely affect consumers' demand for the products and services that we offer. Our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors.8Table of ContentsIf we fail to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our performance is highly dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team and other key employees. Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or failure to retain key employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, a significant amount of turnover of senior management employees with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations. Consumer demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition.We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success. The proliferation of web-based social media means that consumer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty, lower employee retention and productivity, vendor relationship issues, and other factors, all of which could materially affect our profitability.Our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies. We operate in a highly-competitive and ever-changing commercial environment. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategies within this environment. Our current strategy includes transformational change to many areas of our business, including our online and in-store customer experience, our distribution system, employee training and engagement, partnership with our vendors, retail execution, services and cost control. We may experience challenges in achieving the goals we have set, and it is possible that our strategies may prove to be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in future periods. It is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies, that the strategies we will implement expose us to additional risks or that strategies that have been successful in the past will fail to produce the desired results. Our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to design and execute appropriate strategies. The market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them.  Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information regarding our strategies.Failure to effectively manage our property portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.Effective management of our large property portfolio is critical to our success. We primarily secure properties through operating leases with third-party landlords. If we fail to negotiate appropriate terms for new leases we enter into, we may incur lease costs that are excessive and cause operating margins to be below acceptable levels. We may also make term commitments that are too long or too short, without the option to exit early or extend. The availability of suitable new property locations may also hinder our ability to maintain or grow our operations. Factors such as the condition of local property markets, availability of lease financing, taxes, zoning and environmental issues, and competitive actions may impact the availability for suitable property.We have closed stores, and we may close additional stores or other facilities in the future. For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a property can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local property market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors. If these factors are unfavorable to us, then the costs of exiting a property can be significant. When we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we remain at risk of default by the tenant and the impact of such defaults on our future results could be significant.9Table of ContentsFailure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Certain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. Demand for our products and services is difficult to predict, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income. The competitiveness in our industry and increasing price transparency mean that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever. As a result, we must continuously focus on managing our cost structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, other store expenses or indirect spending could severely impair our ability to maintain our price competitiveness while achieving acceptable levels of profitability.Our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms. We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue growth opportunities, and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs. In fiscal 2015, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. maintained its long-term credit rating at Baa2 and revised its outlook from Negative to Stable. Fitch Ratings Ltd. upgraded its long-term credit rating from BB- to BB, maintaining its outlook as Stable. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services maintained their long-term credit rating at BB with a Stable outlook.Future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact our access to capital markets, the borrowing cost for future financings and the perception of our credit risk by lenders and other third parties. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.Any downgrade may result in higher interest costs for certain of our credit facilities and could result in higher interest costs on future financings. In addition, downgrades may impact our ability to obtain adequate financing, including via trade payables with our vendors. Customers' inclination to shop with us or purchase gift cards or extended warranties may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of our credit ratings.Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.From time to time, our strategy has involved, and may in the future involve, entering into new business ventures and strategic alliances, as well as making acquisitions. Assessing a potential opportunity can be based on assumptions that might not ultimately prove to be correct. In addition, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. The success of these opportunities is also largely dependent on the current and future participation, working relationship and strategic vision of the business venture or strategic alliance partners, which can change following a transaction. Integrating new businesses, stores and concepts can be a difficult task. Cultural differences in some markets into which we may expand or into which we may introduce new retail concepts may not be as well received by customers as originally anticipated. These types of transactions may divert our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities and may also negatively impact our return on invested capital. Further, implementing new partnerships, strategic alliances or business ventures may also impair our relationships with our vendors or other strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting and deficiencies in information technology systems in connection with the integration of an acquired company. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could suffer materially. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to impairment of the associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. 10Table of ContentsFailure to protect the integrity, security and confidentiality of our employee and customer data could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our customers. The use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business, our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. We are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information. Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff, the costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we take significant steps to protect this information, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee, customer and other confidential data. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which may in turn have a negative impact on our sales, and may expose us to material costs, penalties and compensation claims. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our operating results.We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2015, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 73% of the merchandise we purchased, with 5 suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG Electronics – representing approximately 47% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. We depend on our vendors for, among other things, appropriate allocation of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within our stores, acceptance of product returns, approval and payment for factory warranty claims and funding for various forms of promotional programs. To varying degrees, our vendors may be able to leverage their financial strength, customer popularity or alternative channels (including, in some instances, our vendors’ own retail locations or websites) to influence these factors and other factors to our commercial disadvantage. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.  We are also dependent on mobile network carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our revenues and margins. For example, if carriers change customer upgrade terms, monthly fee plans, cancellation fees or service levels, the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced, adversely affecting our revenues and profitability. In addition, many of our carriers also serve customers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers. If customers choose to upgrade or make new connections through carriers directly, rather than through us, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. We could also experience declines in revenue and profitability if our carriers decided not to allow us to market their products or services. We have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, port delays, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our financial results. Changes in the demand for our service offerings could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.Our customer promises include provision of a full range of services to complement our product offerings, including extended warranties, delivery, installation, technical support, network set-up and repair services. Many of these service offerings are through our Geek Squad brand, which provides an opportunity to deliver superior customer service and drives incremental revenue and income – often through attachment of these services at the point of sale. As customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions, there is a risk that we are unsuccessful in effectively promoting the benefits of these complementary service offerings through those channels. If we fail to design and market these services 11Table of Contentseffectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers’ expectations in the execution of these services, our revenues and income could be adversely affected.Natural disasters, changes in climate and geo-political events could adversely affect our operating results.The threat or occurrence of one or more natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, the threat or outbreak of terrorism, civil unrest or other hostilities or conflicts, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. These events may result in damage to or destruction or closure of, our stores, distribution centers and other properties. Such events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and other properties, can modify consumer purchasing patterns and decrease disposable income, and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network.Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. Sales of our exclusive brands products, which primarily include Insignia, Modal, Dynex, Init, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, represent an important component of our revenue. Most of these products are manufactured by contracted manufacturers based in southeastern Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results:•We have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contracted manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;•We may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls;•We may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key factories or unforeseen natural disasters;•We may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;•We are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;•We may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;•We may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and•Regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate sales and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the margins we are able to generate from them. We are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:•The difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;•The potential for unexpected costs related to new or compliance with existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials;•The impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security, whether imposed as a result of increased cyber-security risks or otherwise;•The impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform, National Labor Relations Board rule changes, health care reform, corporate governance matters and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;12Table of Contents•The impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards; and•The impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters.Regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters. Changes to the National Labor Relations Act or other labor-related statutes or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. The National Labor Relations Board continually considers changes to labor regulations, many of which could significantly impact the nature of labor relations in the U.S. and how union organizing and union elections are conducted. The U.S. Department of Labor is considering new regulations requiring companies to publicly report the use and associated expense of external resources providing labor relations guidance and advice. As of January 31, 2015, none of our U.S. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements. Changes in labor-related statutes or regulations could increase the percentage of elections won by unions. If any segment of Best Buy’s operations became unionized, it could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our operations. Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect the profitability of our promotional financing and credit card arrangements and our promotional financing offerings and therefore our operating results.  We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by a third-party bank that manages and directly extends credit to our customers. The cardholders can receive low- or no-interest promotional financing on qualifying purchases. Total revenues from these programs accounted for approximately 20% of our revenue in fiscal 2015. We view these arrangements as a way to generate incremental sales of products and services from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment. In addition, we earn profit-share income from our banking partners based on the performance of the credit card portfolio, and the amount of income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors such as the volume of credit card or financing transactions, bad debt rates, interest rates, the regulatory environment and expenses of operating the program. Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the program.  We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, staff planning and deployment, website offerings, financial management and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could significantly disrupt our business and cause, for example, higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation.In addition, we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications.  Disruptions to these services, such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels or other technical difficulties, could cause us to forego material revenues and adversely affect our reputation with consumers.   We utilize third-party vendors for certain aspects of our business operations. We engage key third-party business partners to support various functions of our business, including but not limited to, information technology, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, customer warranty and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our ability to continue operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods. 13Table of ContentsWe are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.  Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Unexpected events or developments such as natural or man-made disasters, product sourcing issues, failure or interruption of management information systems, disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors or adverse economic conditions in our fourth fiscal quarter could have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations.Our revenues and margins are highly sensitive to developments in products and services. The consumer electronics industry involves constant innovation and evolution of products and services offered to consumers. The following examples demonstrate the impact this can have on our business:  •Following the introduction of tablets, their sales grew rapidly and changed the market for mobile computing devices; however, the market has declined rapidly in fiscal 2015 as demand levels have fallen due to market saturation and minimal product innovation;•Product convergence has significantly impacted the demand for some products; for example, the growth of increasingly sophisticated smartphones has reduced the demand for separate cameras, gaming systems, music players and GPS devices;•The timing of new product introductions and updates can have a dramatic impact on the timing of revenues; for example, the introduction of new gaming systems can produce high demand levels for hardware and the accompanying software, which may be followed by several years of decline in demand;•Delivery models for some products are affected by technological advances and new product innovations; for example, media such as music, video and gaming is increasingly transferring to digital delivery methods that may reduce the need for physical CD, DVD, Blu-ray and gaming products; and•Disruptions in the availability of content (such as sporting events or other broadcast programming) may influence the demand for hardware that our customers purchase to access such content, as well as the commission we receive from service providers.Many of the factors described above are not controllable by us. The factors can have a material adverse impact on our relevance to the consumer and the demand for products and services we have traditionally offered. It is possible that these and similar changes could materially affect our revenues and profitability. Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.  We operate international retail locations in Canada and Mexico. In addition, we have a presence in various other foreign countries, including Bermuda, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Luxembourg, the Republic of Mauritius, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Turks and Caicos, and the U.K. During fiscal 2015, our International segment's operations generated 11% of our revenue. Our future operating results in these countries and in other countries or regions throughout the world where we may operate in the future could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including political conditions, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, foreign trade rules and monetary and fiscal policies (both of the U.S. and of other countries). In addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future revenues, earnings and cash flows from International operations and could materially adversely affect our reported financial performance.  Our International segment's operations face other risks as well, including the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S., and potential adverse tax consequences. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S. and may be exaggerated by differences in culture, laws and regulations. There is a heightened risk that we misjudge the response of consumers in foreign markets to our product and service assortments, marketing and promotional strategy and store and website designs, among other factors, and this could adversely impact the results of these operations and the viability of these ventures.14Table of ContentsFailure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results for future periods.

.Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our common stock and debt instruments. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. We face strong competition from traditional store-based retailers, multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses, our vendors and other forms of retail commerce, which directly affects our sales and margins.The retail business is highly competitive. Price is of primary importance to customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital tools. We compete with many other local, regional, national and international retailers, as well as certain of our vendors who offer their products directly to consumers. Some of our competitors have greater market presence and financial resources than we do. The retail industry continues to experience a trend toward an increase in internet sales, and some internet-only businesses are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all U.S. states, which can negatively impact the ability of store-based retailers to be price competitive. In addition, because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service utilizing a multi-channel platform, our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors. Changes in the levels of these various competitive factors may have a significant impact on consumer demand for our products and services and the margins we can generate from them.8Table of ContentsFailure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner could result in a decline in our sales.Our success depends on our vendors' and our ability to successfully introduce new products, services and technologies to consumers. The level of success we achieve is dependent on, among other factors, the frequency of product and service innovations, how accurately we predict consumer preferences, the level of consumer demand, the availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Consumers continue to have a wide variety of choices in terms of how and where they purchase the products and services we sell. Failure to accurately predict and adapt to constantly changing technology and consumer preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.Sustained or worsening economic pressures in the U.S. and key international markets could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results.For the past several years, we have experienced the impact of difficult and uncertain macroeconomic conditions in the geographic markets in which we operate. Some of our products and services are viewed by some consumers to be discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. Consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, and costs for items such as fuel, energy and food, can adversely affect consumers' demand for the products and services that we offer. Our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors.If we fail to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our performance is highly dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team and other key employees. Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce. The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store employees. Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, unemployment rates, competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or failure to retain key employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities. In addition, we have experienced a significant amount of turnover of senior management employees with specific knowledge relating to us, our operations and our industry, which turnover may negatively impact our operations. Consumer demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition.We operate a global portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success. The proliferation of web-based social media means that consumer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty, lower employee retention and productivity, vendor relationship issues, and other factors, all of which could materially affect our profitability.Our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategies. Our current strategy includes transformational change to many areas of our business, including our online and in-store customer experience, expanding our distribution system by shipping to customers from our stores, employee training and engagement, partnership with our vendors, retail execution and cost control. Achieving the goals we have set in a timely manner will be challenging, and it is possible that our strategies may prove to be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in future periods. It is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies, that the strategies we will implement expose us to additional risks or that strategies that have been successful in the past will fail to produce the desired results. Our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to design and execute appropriate strategies. The market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them.  9Table of ContentsRefer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information regarding our strategies.Failure to effectively manage our property portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.As a multi-national retailer, effective management of our large property portfolio is critical to our success. We primarily secure properties through operating leases with third-party landlords. If we fail to negotiate appropriate terms for new leases we enter into, we may incur lease costs that are excessive and cause operating margins to be below acceptable levels. We may also make term commitments that are too long or too short, without the option to extend. The availability of suitable new property locations may also hinder our ability to maintain or grow our operations. Factors such as the condition of local property markets, availability of lease financing, taxes, zoning and environmental issues, and competitive actions may impact the availability for suitable property.We have closed stores, and we may close additional stores or other facilities in the future. For leased property, the financial impact of exiting a property can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local property market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors. If these factors are unfavorable to us, then the costs of exiting a property can be significant. When we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we remain at risk of default by the tenant and the impact of such defaults on our future results could be significant.Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.Certain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. Consumer spending remains uncertain, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income. The competitiveness in our industry and increasing price transparency mean that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever. As a result, we must continuously focus on managing our cost structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, other store expenses or indirect spending could severely impair our ability to maintain our price competitiveness while achieving acceptable levels of profitability.Our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms. We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and liquid investments, credit facilities, other debt arrangements and trade payables. Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms and/or impose tighter credit limits. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, and our reputation with potential lenders. These factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue growth opportunities, and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due.Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs. In fiscal 2014, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. maintained its long-term credit rating at Baa2, but revised its outlook from Developing to Negative. Fitch Ratings Ltd. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services maintained their long-term credit ratings at BB- and BB, respectively, and each revised its outlook from Negative to Stable.Future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact our access to capital markets, the borrowing cost for future financings and the perception of our credit risk by lenders and other third parties. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies.Any downgrade may result in higher interest costs for certain of our credit facilities and could result in higher interest costs on future financings. In addition, downgrades may impact our ability to obtain adequate financing, including via trade payables with our vendors. Customers' inclination to shop with us or purchase gift cards or extended warranties may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of our credit ratings.10Table of ContentsFailure to effectively manage strategic ventures or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business.From time to time, our strategy has involved, and may in the future involve, entering into new business ventures and strategic alliances, and making acquisitions. Assessing a potential opportunity can be based on assumptions that might not ultimately prove to be correct. In addition, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. The success of these opportunities is also largely dependent on the current and future participation, working relationship and strategic vision of the business venture or strategic alliance partners, which can change following a transaction. Integrating new businesses, stores and concepts can be a difficult task. Cultural differences in some markets into which we may expand or into which we may introduce new retail concepts may not be as well received by customers as originally anticipated. These types of transactions may divert our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities and may also negatively impact our return on invested capital. Further, implementing strategic alliances or business ventures may also impair our relationships with our vendors or other strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting and deficiencies in information technology systems in connection with the integration of an acquired company. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could suffer materially. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to impairment of the associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Failure to protect the integrity, security and confidentiality of our customers' data, including payment card information, could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our customers. The use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business, our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. We are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information. Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance and costs resulting from consumer fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we take significant steps to protect this information, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate customer and other confidential data. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and may expose us to material costs, penalties and compensation claims. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. Our reliance on key vendors subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our operating results.We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2014, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70% of the merchandise we purchased, with 5 suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG Electronics – representing approximately 45% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our major suppliers that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. If there is a loss of or disruption in supply from any of our key vendors, if any of our key vendors fail to develop new technologies that consumers demand or if our vendors make changes that affect the timing of when customers are able to make purchases, our revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected. In addition, the formation or strengthening of business partnerships between our vendors and our competitors could limit our access to merchandise.We have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our financial results. 11Table of ContentsNatural disasters, changes in climate and geo-political events could adversely affect our operating results.The threat or occurrence of one or more natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, the threat or outbreak of terrorism, civil unrest or other hostilities or conflicts, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. These events may result in damage to or destruction or closure of, our stores, distribution centers and other properties. Such events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and other properties, can modify consumer purchasing patterns and decrease disposable income, and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network.Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results. Sales of our exclusive brands products, which primarily include Insignia, Dynex, Init, Platinum and Rocketfish branded products, represent an important component of our revenue. Most of these products are manufactured by contracted manufacturers based in southeastern Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results:•We have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects, and our recourse to contracted manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions;•We may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls;•We may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key factories or unforeseen natural disasters;•We may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards, whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer;•We are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;•We may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products;•We may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes; and•Regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and, depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.Maintaining consistent quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty, generate sales and achieve acceptable margins. Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the margins we are able to generate from them. We are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our statutory, regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:•The difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;•The impact of new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform, environmental requirements, National Labor Relations Board rule changes, health care reform, data privacy and cyber-security rules, corporate governance matters and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;•The impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards; and•The impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters.12Table of ContentsDefending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters. Changes to the National Labor Relations Act or other labor-related statutes or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model. The National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) continually considers changes to labor regulations, many of which could significantly impact the nature of labor relations in the U.S. and how union organizing and union elections are conducted. The NLRB has stated it intends to attempt to make union organizing easier. The U.S. Department of Labor is considering new regulations requiring companies to publicly report the use and associated expense of external resources providing labor relations guidance and advice. As of February 1, 2014, none of our U.S. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements. Changes in labor-related statutes or regulations could increase the percentage of elections won by unions. If any segment of Best Buy’s operations became unionized, it could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our operations. Additional legislation or regulatory activity could have a material adverse impact on our costs or disrupt our operations.  Environmental legislation or other regulatory changes could impose unexpected costs or impact us more directly than other companies due to our operations as a global retailer. Specifically, environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, electronics recycling and water or product materials are continually being explored by governing bodies. Increasing energy and fuel costs, supply chain disruptions and other potential risks to our business, as well as any significant rulemaking or passage of any such legislation, could materially increase the cost to transport our goods and materially adversely affect our results of operations. New regulations governing consumer privacy and security, whether imposed as a result of increased cyber security risks or otherwise, could materially increase our compliance costs. Regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has increased in recent years, increasing the risk of fines and additional operational costs associated with compliance. Economic, regulatory and other developments could adversely affect the profitability of our credit card arrangements and our promotional financing offerings and therefore our operating results.  We offer promotional financing through credit cards issued by a third-party bank that manages and directly extends credit to our customers. The cardholders can receive low- or no-interest promotional financing on qualifying purchases. Promotional financing credit card sales account for approximately 19% of our revenue in fiscal 2014. We view these arrangements as a way to generate incremental sales of products and services from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment, and incremental income from the payments received from our banking partners. The profitability of our new credit card arrangement is more dependent on the performance of our credit card portfolio than our previous arrangement. Regulatory, legislative or economic factors could adversely affect the performance of the portfolio, and this may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, continuing changes in the economic and regulatory environment in the banking industry may lead banks to re-evaluate their strategies, practices and terms, including, but not limited to, the extent to which consumer credit is granted and the strategic focus on the retail partner credit card business. Promotional financing volumes could be materially adversely affected in response to substantial changes to our credit card program, such as substantial modifications to the terms and provisions of the program, or substantial adjustments to approval rates or the types of financing offered to our customers. Our international activities subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, accounting and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate.  We have a presence in various foreign countries, including Bermuda, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Republic of Mauritius, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Turks and Caicos, and the U.K. During fiscal 2014, our International segment's operations generated 16% of our revenue. Our future operating results in these countries and in other countries or regions throughout the world where we may operate in the future could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including political conditions, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, foreign trade rules and monetary and fiscal policies (both of the U.S. and of other countries). In addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future revenues, earnings and cash flows from International operations, and could materially adversely affect our reported financial performance.  13Table of ContentsOur International segment's operations face other risks as well, including the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S., and potential adverse tax consequences. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the complexity of operating in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. There is a heightened risk that we misjudge the response of consumers in foreign markets to our product and service assortments, marketing and promotional strategy and store and website designs, among other factors, and this could adversely impact the results of these operations and the viability of these ventures. We rely heavily on our management information systems for our key business processes. Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business, including demand forecasting, purchasing, supply chain management, point-of-sale processing, staff planning and deployment, website offerings, financial management and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could significantly disrupt our business and cause, for example, higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation. We rely on third-party vendors for certain aspects of our business operations. We engage key third-party business partners to manage various functions of our business, including but not limited to, information technology, human resource operations, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, customer warranty and insurance programs. Any material disruption in our relationship with key third-party business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our ability to continue operations, particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods. We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season.  Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Unexpected events or developments such as natural or man-made disasters, product sourcing issues, failure or interruption of management information systems, disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by third-party vendors or adverse economic conditions in our fourth fiscal quarter could have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations.Our revenues and margins are highly sensitive to developments in products and services. The consumer electronics industry involves constant innovation and evolution of products and services offered to consumers. The following examples demonstrate the impact this can have on our business:  •New product categories such as tablets and e-readers have grown rapidly and fundamentally changed the market for mobile computing devices; however, as products reach maturity and/or markets become saturated, demands levels can fall sharply;•Product convergence has significantly impacted the demand for some products; for example, the growth of increasingly sophisticated smartphones has reduced the demand for separate cameras, gaming systems, music players and GPS devices;•The timing of new product introductions and updates can have a dramatic impact on the timing of revenues; for example, the introduction of new gaming systems can produce high demand levels for hardware and the accompanying software, which may be followed by several years of decline in demand;•Delivery models for some products are affected by technological advances and new product innovations; for example, media such as music, video and gaming is increasingly transferring to digital delivery methods that may reduce the need for physical CD, DVD, Blu-ray and gaming products; and•Disruptions in the availability of content (such as sporting events or other broadcast programming) may influence the demand for hardware that our customers purchase to access such content, as well as the commission we receive from service providers.Many of the factors described above are not controllable by us. The factors can have a material adverse impact on our relevance to the consumer and the demand for products and services we have traditionally offered. It is possible that these and similar changes could materially affect our revenues and profitability. 14Table of ContentsFailure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price. We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline"
9,BBY,BEST BUY CO INC,2012-05-01,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
.Described below are certain risks that our management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to sources of financing could be materially adversely affected. The following risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf related to conditions or events that we anticipate may occur in the future. The following risks should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. If we do not anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our operating results could materially suffer. Our business depends, in large part, on our ability to successfully introduce new products, services and technologies to consumers, the frequency of such introductions, the level of consumer acceptance, and the related impact on the demand for existing products, services and technologies. Consumers continue to have a wide variety of choices in terms of how and where they purchase these products, services and technologies. Consumers also continue to benefit from the convergence of technology products, where one product combines and replaces several others. Failure to accurately predict and adapt to constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, or to effectively address consumer concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and reputation with our customers. Economic conditions in the U.S. and key international markets or other conditions leading to a decline in consumer discretionary spending may materially adversely impact our operating results. We sell certain products and services that consumers may view as discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations tend to be more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Other factors, including consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, consumer debt levels, consumers' ability to obtain credit, and fuel and energy costs could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. In the past three fiscal years, many of these factors adversely affected consumer spending and, consequently, our business and results of operations. A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy, continued economic and financial instability in Europe, or an uncertain economic outlook, could materially adversely affect consumer spending habits and our operating results in the future.The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. The threat or outbreak of domestic or international terrorism, civil unrest or other hostilities could lead to a decrease in consumer spending. Similarly, an overly anti-business climate or sentiment could potentially lead consumers to decrease or shift their spending habits. Any of these events and factors could cause a decrease in revenue or an increase in inventory markdowns or certain operating expenses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.Other conditions or factors that may impact our results of operations include disruptions to the availability of content such as sporting events or other televised content. Such disruptions may influence the demand for hardware that our customers purchase to access such content, as well as the commissions we receive from subscription services. Accordingly, such disruptions could cause a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. 13Table of ContentsOur results of operations could materially deteriorate if we fail to attract, develop and retain qualified employees. Our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees who are able to develop the skills necessary to achieve our business strategies. We believe our competitive advantage is providing unique end-to-end solutions for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store, service and administrative personnel. The turnover rate in the retail industry is high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and quantity needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand our initiatives, our exclusive brands and our international operations. Delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face strong competition from traditional store-based retailers, internet-based businesses, our vendors and other forms of retail commerce, which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability. The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for customers, employees, locations, products and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national and international retailers, as well as our vendors who offer their products and services direct to the consumer. We continue to face pressure from our competitors, some of which have greater market presence and financial resources than we do. In addition, certain internet-based businesses do not collect and remit state and local sales taxes in all of the states in which we are required to collect and remit such taxes. These factors could require us to reduce our prices or increase our costs of doing business. In addition, because our business strategy includes staffing and support models for both products and services, our cost structure is generally higher than those offering products only. Some of our vendors also continue to interact directly with customers by embedding their services into the products we sell. As a result of this competition and the potential for direct product distribution, we may experience lower revenue and/or higher operating costs, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Our results of operations could materially deteriorate if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition. We operate a global portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation. We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success. The advent of social media, which uses web-based technologies for interactive dialogue, represents an increasingly popular outlet for various types of feedback, opinions and criticism surrounding the perception and reputation of our business and our brands. Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty, lower employee morale and productivity concerns, and vendor relationship issues, and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth is dependent on the success of our strategies. Our growth is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute our strategies. Our failure to properly deploy and utilize capital and other resources may adversely affect our initiatives designed to assist our customers in connecting to a digital lifestyle. We are focusing on areas where we see the greatest opportunities for growth and profit: growth in connections in mobile phones, tablets and other computing devices; enhanced digital and e-commerce strategies, including competitive online pricing, broader use of free shipping, expanded online assortment and the further development of the Best Buy Marketplace; growth in our services business; and expansion of our established business in China. Likewise, we recently announced a series of actions intended to transform our business, focusing on improving the customer experience and our financial performance, including the roll-out of our Connected Store format in select markets. Misjudgments or flaws in our execution of these initiatives and strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information surrounding our strategies.Our ability to generate profitable growth is dependent upon the effective management of our property portfolio.Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build, buy or lease new stores. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use, local zoning issues, environmental regulations and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and also influence the cost of building, buying and leasing our stores. We also may have difficulty negotiating real estate purchase agreements and leases on acceptable terms. Failure to manage effectively these and other similar factors will affect our ability to build, buy and lease new stores, which may have a material adverse effect on our future profitability.14Table of ContentsWe may seek to expand or reposition our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. Because our stores typically draw customers from their local areas, a new store may draw customers away from our nearby existing stores and may cause customer traffic and comparable store sales performance to decline at those existing stores.We also open stores in new markets from time to time. The risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting customers where there is a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences, seasonal differences in the market and our ability to obtain the necessary governmental approvals. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. Our current growth strategy includes refocusing our investments on areas that we believe have the potential to meet our rate of return expectations. We expect to continue the expansion of our small-format Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. and our Five Star branded stores in China. We cannot ensure that our new stores, regardless of brand, size, format or market, will be profitably deployed. As a result, our future profitability may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, in order to optimize the returns we realize from our property portfolio, we may vacate leased properties or modify the terms of such leases prior to the termination of the lease. If we are unable to effectively negotiate such changes with the landlords and/or find suitable subtenants, we may incur excessive lease costs associated with these actions. The failure to control our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Certain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. Consumer spending remains uncertain, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income. As a result, we must continue to control our expense structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, other store expenses or indirect spending could delay or prevent us from achieving profitability goals or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets. We must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue promising business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under credit facilities and other debt financings. If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may have to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of us or the retail industry generally. If required, we may not be able to obtain additional financing, on favorable terms, or at all. Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital markets and materially increase our borrowing costs.In fiscal 2012, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services maintained their corporate and debt ratings at investment grade level with a stable outlook. Fitch Ratings Ltd. maintained its rating of our corporate and debt securities at investment grade level but lowered it from BBB+ to BBB-, while raising its outlook to stable. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2012, Fitch Ratings Ltd. reaffirmed its corporate and debt rating, but revised its outlook to negative.Future downgrades to our long-term credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and the perception of us by lenders and other third parties. Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time. Rating agencies may review the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control, including as a result of new standards requiring the agencies to re-assess rating practices and methodologies.Any downgrade to our debt securities may result in higher interest costs for certain of our credit facilities and other debt financings, and could result in higher interest costs on future financings. Further, in the event of such a downgrade, we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on favorable terms, or at all. 15Table of ContentsFailure in our pursuit or execution of new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our growth strategy also includes expansion via new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions. Assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence. However, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitions will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. The success of these growth opportunities is also largely dependent on the current and future participation, working relationship and strategic vision of the business venture or strategic alliance partners. Integrating new businesses, stores and concepts can be a difficult task. Cultural differences in some markets into which we may expand or into which we may introduce new retail concepts may result in customers in those markets being less receptive than originally anticipated. These types of transactions may divert our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. Further, implementing new strategic alliances or business ventures may also impair our relationships with our vendors or strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could suffer materially. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to impairment of the associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Failure to protect the integrity, security and use of our customers' information and media could expose us to litigation and materially damage our standing with our customers. The use of individually identifiable data by our business, our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state, federal and international levels. Increasing costs associated with information security – such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud – could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we have taken significant steps to protect customer and confidential information, the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures. As a result, unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate confidential data. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and personal data. Furthermore, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. If any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition. Any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk. Risks associated with the vendors from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. In fiscal 2012, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for just over 60% of the merchandise we purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our major suppliers that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. If any of our key vendors fails to supply us with products or continue to develop new technologies that create consumer demand, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our revenue could materially decline. Likewise, the formation and/or strengthening of business partnerships between our vendors and our competitors could directly alter the composition of products and level of customer purchasing within our stores and online, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.We require all of our vendors to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required vendor standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit. 16Table of ContentsOur exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product, supply chain and legal risks, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Sales of our exclusive brands, which primarily include Insignia, Dynex, Init, Geek Squad and Rocketfish branded products, represent an important component of our revenue. Most of these products are manufactured under contract by vendors based in southeastern Asia. This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results:•We have greater exposure and responsibility to the consumer for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of product defects, as we generally have less recourse to contracted manufacturers for such warranty liabilities;•We may be subject to regulatory compliance and/or product liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by such products, some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls;•We may experience disruptions in the manufacturing or the logistics within the manufacturing environment in southeastern Asia caused by inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key factories or unforeseen natural disasters;•We are subject to developing and often-changing labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries, and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner;•We may be subject to claims by technology owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our products; and•We may be unable to obtain or adequately protect our patents and other intellectual property rights on our products, the new features of our products and/or our processes. Maintaining consistent product quality, availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products for our customers is critical to building and maintaining customer and brand loyalty. Changes in consumer acceptance or confidence relating to our exclusive brands products could materially reduce our overall revenues and negatively affect operating results.We are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our statutory, regulatory and legal environment exposes us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:•The difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national or international jurisdictions;•The impact of new or changing statutes and regulations including, but not limited to, financial reform, environmental requirements, National Labor Relations Board rule changes, health care reform, corporate governance matters and/or other as yet unknown legislation, that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure;•The impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards; and•The impact of litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, and labor and employment matters.Defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management's attention and resources from other matters. Furthermore, pending regulatory rules regarding requirements to disclose efforts to identify the origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations.Changes to the National Labor Relations Act or other labor-related statutes or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business. The National Labor Relations Board continually considers changes to labor regulations, many of which could significantly impact the nature of labor relations in the U.S. and how union elections and contract negotiations are conducted. In 2011, the definition of a bargaining unit changed, making it possible for smaller groups of employees to organize labor unions. Furthermore, new representation election rules – which became effective on April 30, 2012 – have streamlined the election 17Table of Contentsprocess, shortening the time between the filing of a petition and an election being held. Additional changes are anticipated in 2012. As of March 3, 2012, none of our U.S. operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements. Changes in labor-related statutes or regulations could increase the percentage of elections won by unions, and employers of newly unionized employees would have a duty to bargain in good faith over matters such as wages, benefits and labor scheduling, which could increase our costs of doing business and materially adversely affect our results of operations. Additional legislation or rulemaking relating to environmental matters, including but not limited to, energy emissions, could have a material adverse impact on our business. Environmental legislation or rulemaking efforts could impose unexpected costs or impact us more directly than other companies due to our operations as a global consumer electronics retailer with over 4,000 stores and 91 distribution centers worldwide.Specifically, environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy, carbon emissions, water or product materials are continually being explored by governing bodies. Increasing energy and fuel costs, supply chain disruptions and other potential risks to our business, as well as any significant rulemaking or passage of any such legislation, could materially increase the cost to transport our goods and materially adversely affect our results of operations. Regulatory developments in the U.S. could impact the promotional financing offers available to our credit card customers and have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. We offer promotional financing in the U.S. through credit cards issued by third party banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers. The cardholders can receive low- or no-interest promotional financing on qualifying purchases. Promotional financing credit card sales accounted for 20%, 18% and 17% of our Domestic segment's revenue in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.If future legislative or regulatory restrictions or prohibitions arise that significantly alter the operational, economic or contractual aspects of these programs and we or the issuing banks are unable to adjust in a timely manner, our revenue and profitability may be materially adversely affected. Changes to our credit card agreements could adversely impact our ability to facilitate the provision of consumer credit to our customers and could materially adversely impact our results of operations.We have agreements with third party banks for the issuance of promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards. Under the agreements, the banks manage and directly extend credit to our customers. The banks are the sole owner of the accounts receivable generated under the credit card programs and absorb losses associated with non-payment by the cardholders and fraudulent usage of the accounts. We earn revenue from fees the banks pay to us based on the number of credit card accounts activated and card usage, as well as revenue generated from various enhancement services products such as debt cancellation, credit monitoring and identity protection services . The banks also reimburse us for certain costs associated with our credit card programs. Financing fees are paid by us to the banks and are variable based on certain factors such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), charge volume and/or the types of promotional financing offers.As a result of the continuing changes in the economic and regulatory environment for banks, these institutions continue to re-evaluate their strategies, practices and terms, including, but not limited to, the levels at which consumer credit is granted and the strategic focus on various business segments, such as the retail partner card business. If any of our credit card programs ended prematurely or the terms and provisions, or interpretations thereof, were substantially modified, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted. Our International activities subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We have a presence in various foreign countries, including Bermuda, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Republic of Mauritius, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turks and Caicos, and the U.K. During fiscal 2012, our International segment's operations generated 26% of our revenue. Our future operating results in these countries and in other countries or regions throughout the world where we may operate in the future could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including political conditions, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints and foreign currency regulations. 18Table of ContentsSpecifically, significant concerns exist surrounding the ability of certain governments of member states of the European Union to meet their financial obligations and the indirect impacts this could have on the macroeconomic environment in Europe.In addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future earnings and cash flows from our International segment's operations, and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they were to occur again, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may materially adversely impact our International segment's operations include foreign trade, monetary, tax and fiscal policies both of the U.S. and of other countries; laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations; and maintaining facilities in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S.Additional risks inherent in our International segment's operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. We rely heavily on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other functions. If our systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to manage our order entry, order fulfillment, pricing, point-of-sale and inventory replenishment processes. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could disrupt our business and could result in decreased revenue, increased overhead costs and excess or out-of-stock inventory levels, causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially. A disruption in relationships with key third-party business partners could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have engaged Accenture LLP (“Accenture”), a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company, to manage significant portions of our information technology and human resources operations. We rely heavily on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other functions. We also rely heavily on human resources support to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. Furthermore, we have engaged other key third-party business partners to manage various functions of our business, including but not limited to, customer loyalty programs, promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards, customer warranty and insurance programs, and other outsourced functions. Any material disruption in our relationship with Accenture or other key third-party business partners could result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially. We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday selling season. Approximately one-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings are historically generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Europe and Canada. Although our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 included certain impacts arising from the buy-out of a profit share agreement and from restructuring activities, we remain highly dependent on cash flows and net earnings generated during our fourth fiscal quarter. Unexpected events or developments such as natural or man-made disasters, product sourcing issues or adverse economic conditions in our fourth fiscal quarter could have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations"

.Described beloware certain risks that our management believes are applicable to our businessand the industry in which we operate. There may be additional risks that arenot presently material or known. There are also risks within the economy andthe capital markets, both domestically and internationally, that affectbusiness generally, and our company and industry as well, such as inflation;higher interest rates; higher fuel and other energy costs; higher transportationcosts; higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare; foreign currencyexchange rate fluctuations; 13 and higherlevels of unemployment, which have not been described. You should carefullyconsider each of the following risks and all other information set forth inthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.If any of the events described below were to occur, our business,financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or access to the capitalmarkets could be materially adversely affected.

We believe our competitive advantage is providingunique end-to-end solutions for each individual customer, which requires us tohave highly trained and engaged employees. Our success depends in part upon ourability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualifiedemployees, including store, service and administrative personnel. The turnoverrate in the retail industry is high, and qualified individuals of the requisitecaliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply insome areas. Competition for such qualified individuals could require us to payhigher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Our inability torecruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delayplanned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expandinitiatives such as Best Buy For Business and services. Delayed store openings,significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases inlabor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.We face strong competition from traditional store-based retailers,Internet businesses and other forms of retail commerce, which could materiallyaffect our revenue and profitability.The retail business is highly competitive. Wecompete for customers, employees, locations, products and other importantaspects of our business with many other local, regional, national andinternational retailers. Pressure from our competitors, some of which have agreater market presence and more financial resources than we do, could requireus to reduce our prices or increase our costs of doing business. As a result ofthis competition, we may experience lower revenue and/or higher operatingcosts, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.Our growth strategy includes expanding our business, both in existingmarkets and by opening stores in new markets.Our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build orlease new stores. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitablelocations for our stores. Local land use, local zoning issues, environmentalregulations and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desireto construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and alsoinfluence the cost of constructing and leasing our stores.

Because our stores typically draw customers from their localareas, a new store may draw customers away from our nearby existing stores 14 and may causecustomer traffic and comparable store sales performance to decline at thoseexisting stores.We also intend to open stores in new markets. The risks associated withentering a new market include difficulties in attracting customers due to alack of customer familiarity with our brand, our lack of familiarity with localcustomer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entryinto new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or withexisting competitors with a large, established market presence. While we have astrong track record of profitable new-store growth, we cannot ensure that ournew stores will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitabilitymay be materially adversely affected.Risks associated with the vendors from whom our products are sourcedcould materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic andinternational vendors. Global sourcing has become an increasingly importantpart of our business and positively affects our financial performance. Our 20 largest suppliers account for overthree-fifths of the merchandise we purchase.

Delayed store openings, significantincreases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costscould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.Weface strong competition from traditional store-based retailers, Internet businessesand other forms of retail commerce, whichcould materially affect our revenue and profitability.The retail business is highly competitive. We compete for customers,employees, locations, products and other important aspects of our business withmany other local, regional, national and international retailers. Pressure fromour competitors, some of which have a greater market presence than we do, couldrequire us to reduce our prices or increase our costs of doing business. As aresult of this competition, we may experience lower revenue and/or higheroperating costs, which could materially adversely affect our results ofoperations.14 Our growth strategyincludes expanding our business, both in existing markets and by opening storesin new markets.Our futuregrowth is dependent, in part, on our ability to build or lease new stores. Wecompete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for ourstores. Local land use, local zoning issues, environmental regulations andother regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct mayimpact our ability to find suitable locations, and also influence the cost ofconstructing and leasing our stores. We also may have difficulty negotiatingleases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. Failure tomanage these and other similar factors effectively will affect our ability to build or lease newstores, which may have a material adverse effect on our future profitability.We seek toexpand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overallmarket share. Because our stores typically draw customers from their localareas, a new store may draw customers away from our nearby existing stores andmay cause comparable store sales performance and customer traffic at thoseexisting stores to decline.We also intend to open stores in new markets. The risks associated withentering a new market include difficulties in attracting customers due to alack of customer familiarity with our brand, our lack of familiarity with localcustomer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, entryinto new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existingcompetitors with a large, established market presence. And while we have astrong track record of profitable new store growth, we cannot ensure that ournew stores will be profitably deployed; as a result, our future profitabilitymay be materially adversely affected.Risks associated withthe vendors from whom our products are sourced could materially adverselyaffect our revenue and gross profit.The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic andinternational vendors. Global sourcing is becoming an increasingly importantpart of our business and positively affects our financial performance. Our 20 largest suppliers account forapproximately three-fifths of the merchandise we purchase. If any of ourkey vendors fails to supply us with products, we may not be able to meet thedemands of our customers and revenue could decline. We require all of ourvendors to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws,and otherwise be certified as meeting our required vendor standards of conduct.Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply productsin a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially withrespect to goods sourced from outside the United States. Political or financialinstability, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currencyexchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, outbreak ofpandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affectour revenue and gross profit.We are subject tocertain regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverseimpact on our business.Our regulatory and legal environment exposesus to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially affect ouroperations and financial results. In our major global markets, we are subjectto increasing regulations, which increase our cost of doing business. The mostsignificant compliance and litigation risks we face are:·        The difficulty incomplying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national orinternational jurisdictions and new or changing regulations that affect how weoperate;·        The impact of changes intax laws (or interpretations thereof);·        The impact of litigationtrends, including class actions involving consumers and shareholders, and laborand employment matters; and·        Thesignificant uncertainties of operating globally, including the costs anddifficulties of managing international operations, foreign currencies, complexlaws, contractual obligations and intellectual property rights.15 We rely heavily on ourmanagement information systems for inventory management, distribution and otherfunctions. If our systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if weexperience an interruption in their operation, our business and results ofoperations could be materially adversely affected.The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our managementinformation systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems tomanage our order entry, order fulfillment, pricing, point-of-sale and inventoryreplenishment processes. The failure of our management information systems toperform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result indecreased revenue, increased overhead costs and excess or out-of-stockinventory levels, causing our business and results of operations to suffermaterially.A disruption in ourrelationship with Accenture, who manages our information technology and humanresources operations, could materially adversely affect our business andresults of operations.We have engaged Accenture Ltd to manage our information technology andhuman resources operations. We rely heavily on our management informationsystems for inventory management, distribution and other functions. We alsorely heavily on human resources support to attract, develop and retain asufficient number of qualified employees. Any disruption in our relationshipwith Accenture could result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs,causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially.Failure to protect theintegrity and security of our customers information could expose us tolitigation and materially damage our standing with our customers.The increasing costs associated with information security  suchas increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumerprotection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud  could cause ourbusiness and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, thesuccess of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission ofconfidential information over public networks, including the use of cashlesspayments. While we are taking significant efforts to protect customer andconfidential information, there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities,new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will preventthe compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and personaldata. If any such compromise of our security were to occur, it could have amaterial adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results andfinancial condition and may increase the costs we incur to protect against suchsecurity breaches.Failure in our pursuitor execution of new business ventures, strategic alliances and acquisitionscould have a material adverse impact on our business.Our growth strategy includes expansion via new business ventures,strategic alliances and acquisitions. While we employ several differentvaluation methodologies to assess a potential growth opportunity, we can giveno assurance that new business ventures and strategic alliances will positivelyaffect our financial performance. Acquisitions may result in difficulties inassimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of our capitaland our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities. Wemay not be able to integrate companies that we acquire successfully, includingtheir personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and generaloperating procedures. If we fail to integrate acquired companies successfully,our business could suffer materially. We may also encounter challenges inachieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connectionwith the integration of an acquired company. In addition, the integration ofany acquired company, and its financial results, into ours may have a materialadverse effect on our operating results. 16 We are highly dependenton the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter,which includes the majority of the holiday selling season.Approximatelyone-third of our revenue and more than one-half of our net earnings aregenerated in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the majority of theholiday selling season. Unexpected events or developments such as naturaldisasters, man-made disasters and adverse economic conditions in our fourth quartercould have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.The foregoing should not be construed as an exhaustive list of allfactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from thoseexpressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf"
