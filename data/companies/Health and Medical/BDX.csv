0,BDX,BECTON DICKINSON & CO,2011-11-23,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and    uncertainties. The following describes some of the significant    risks that could adversely affect BDs business, financial    condition, operating results or cash flows. Current    economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our    operations.     The global economic conditions may result in a decrease in the    demand for our products and services, increased pricing    pressure, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new    technologies. During fiscal year 2011, our revenue growth was    adversely affected by conditions in the healthcare industry,    including lower healthcare utilization, particularly in the    U.S. and western Europe, cost containment efforts by    governments and other payors for healthcare services and other    factors. These conditions resulted in weaker overall customer    demand and increased pricing pressure for some of our products.    We anticipate that these industry conditions will continue for    the foreseeable future. In addition, while the economic downturn    has not impaired our ability to access credit markets to date,    there can be no assurance that these conditions will not    adversely affect our ability to do so in the future. The current    macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our    suppliers, and there can be no assurances that BD will not    experience any interruptions in supply in the future. We have    also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain    countries in western Europe, and we may experience similar    delays in these and other jurisdictions experiencing liquidity    problems. The continued weakness in world economies makes the    strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain, and    there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will    not deteriorate further. We are    subject to foreign currency exchange risk.     Over half of our fiscal year 2011 revenues were derived from    international operations. Our revenues outside the United States    may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency    exchange rates. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange    rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may    attempt to address any impact is contained in Item. 7,    Managements Discussion of Financial Condition and Results    of Operations. Any hedging activities we engage in may only    offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from    unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We    cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency    exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks. Changes    in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect    the demand for our products and the prices at which they are    sold.     Our sales depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare    providers and facilities are reimbursed by government    authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for    the costs of our products. The coverage policies and    reimbursement levels of third-party payers, which can vary among    public and private sources, may affect which products customers    purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these    products in a particular jurisdiction. Legislative or    administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United    States (as part of healthcare reform or otherwise, as discussed    below) or abroad could significantly    8Table of Contents    reduce reimbursement for procedures using BD products, or result    in denial of reimbursement for those products. See    Third-Party Reimbursement under Item 1.    Business. Federal    healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of    operations.     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the    PPACA) was enacted in March 2010. Under the PPACA,    beginning in 2013, medical device manufacturers, such as BD,    will pay a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical    devices. Sales of BD products that we estimate to be subject to    this tax represented about 80% of BDs total    U.S. revenues in fiscal year 2011. We cannot predict with    any certainty what other impact the PPACA may have on our    business. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to    hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies,    and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures.    These factors, in turn, could result in reduced demand for our    products and increased downward pricing pressure. It is also    possible that the PPACA will result in lower reimbursements for    our products. While the PPACA is intended to expand health    insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States,    the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on    sales of BDs products remains uncertain. Efforts    to reduce the U.S. federal deficit could adversely affect our    results of operations.     As part of the law passed in August 2011 to extend the federal    debt limit and reduce government spending, a bipartisan    committee was established to identify up to $1.5 trillion in    cuts to federal programs. On November 21, 2011, the joint    committee announced that it would not reach an agreement by the    prescribed deadline, which will trigger an automatic $1.2    trillion in additional spending cuts in the absence of further    legislative action. Half of the automatic reductions would come    from lowering the caps imposed on domestic discretionary    spending and cutting domestic entitlement programs, including    reductions in payments to Medicare providers. Government    research funding could also be impacted as part of any deficit    reduction. Any such reductions in government healthcare spending    or research funding could result in reduced demand for our    products or additional pricing pressure. Price    volatility could adversely affect costs associated with our    operations.     Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price    volatility in the cost of raw materials, components, freight and    energy. In particular, BD purchases supplies of resins, which    are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain    products. Any significant increases in resin purchase costs    could impact future operating results. Increases in the price of    oil can also increase BDs costs for packaging and    transportation. New laws or regulations adopted in response to    climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of    certain raw materials and components. These cost increases may    adversely affect our profitability. BDs    future growth is dependent upon the development of new products,    and there can be no assurance that such products will be    developed.     A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue    growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to    patients, healthcare workers and researchers. The development of    these products requires significant research and development,    clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our    product development efforts may be affected by a number of    factors, including BDs ability to innovate, develop and    manufacture new products, complete clinical trials, obtain    regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and    abroad, or gain and maintain market approval of our products. In    addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our    commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that    any products now in development or that we may seek to develop    in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain    regulatory approval, or gain market acceptance.    9Table of ContentsWe cannot    guarantee that any of BDs strategic acquisitions,    investments or alliances will be successful.     As part of our strategy to increase revenue growth, we seek to    supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions,    investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently    risky. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance    may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to    properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or    to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our    existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or    future transaction will be successful. The    medical technology industry is very competitive.     The medical technology industry is subject to rapid    technological changes, and we face significant competition    across our product lines and in each market in which our    products are sold. We face this competition from a wide range of    companies. These include large medical device companies, some of    which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we    do. We also face competition from firms that are more    specialized than we are with respect to particular markets.    Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology    products have become manufacturers of medical devices and    instruments as well. In some instances, competitors, including    pharmaceutical companies, also offer, or are attempting to    develop, alternative therapies for disease states that may be    delivered without a medical device. The development of new or    improved products, processes or technologies by other companies    (such as needle-free injection technology) may render our    products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In    addition, increasing customer demand for more    environmentally-friendly products is creating another basis on    which BD must compete. The entry into the market of    manufacturers located in China and other low-cost manufacturing    locations is also creating pricing pressure, particularly in    developing markets. Some competitors have also established    manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in    these countries as a means to lower their costs. New entrants    may also appear, particularly from these low-cost countries. Consolidation    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect BDs    future revenues and operating income.     The medical technology industry has experienced a significant    amount of consolidation. As a result of this consolidation,    competition to provide goods and services to customers has    increased. In addition, group purchasing organizations and    integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate    purchasing decisions for some customers, which has also placed    pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. Further    consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on    the prices of our products. The    international operations of BDs business may subject BD to    certain business risks.     BD operations outside the United States subject BD to certain    risks, including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency    exchange (discussed above); the effects of local economic    conditions; changes in foreign regulatory requirements; local    product preferences; difficulty in establishing, staffing and    managing foreign operations; differing labor regulations;    changes in tax laws; potential political instability; trade    barriers; weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual    property rights in some countries; and restrictions on the    transfer of capital across borders. The success of our    operations outside the United States will depend, in part, on    our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local    companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to,    among other things, our production facilities and distribution    networks. Reductions    in customers research budgets or government funding may    adversely affect our BD Biosciences segment.     Our BD Biosciences segment sells products to researchers at    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic    institutions, government laboratories and private foundations.    Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate    based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. A    number of these customers are also dependent for their funding    upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the    U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and    agencies in other countries. The level of government funding of    research and development is unpredictable. There have been    instances where NIH    10Table of Contents    grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended    periods. The availability of governmental research funding may    also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic    downturn. Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could    cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products. A    reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials    and components would adversely affect BDs manufacturing    operations and related product sales.     BD purchases many different types of raw materials and    components. Certain raw materials (primarily related to the BD    Biosciences segment) and components are not available from    multiple sources. In addition, for quality assurance,    cost-effectiveness and other reasons, BD elects to purchase    certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers. The    supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of    reasons, including current economic conditions as described    above. While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of    supply, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be    successful. In addition, where there are regulatory requirements    relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able    to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely    basis. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of    these sole-sourced raw materials and components could impact our    ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products. Interruption    of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect BDs    future revenues and operating income.     We have manufacturing sites all over the world. In addition, in    some instances, the manufacturing of certain of our product    lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. As a result,    weather, natural disasters (including pandemics), terrorism,    political change, failure to follow specific internal protocols    and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or    damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect    our ability to manufacture our products. BD is    subject to a number of pending lawsuits.     BD is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits, including    purported class action lawsuits for, among other things, alleged    antitrust violations and patent infringement, and could be    subject to additional lawsuits in the future. A more detailed    description of these lawsuits is contained in Item 3. Legal    Proceedings. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally,    we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of    loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the    litigation to which we are a party. In view of these    uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently    established accruals and, to the extent available, excess    liability insurance. Any such future charges, individually or in    the aggregate, could adversely affect BDs results of    operations and cash flows. BD is    subject to extensive regulation.     BD is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the    Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in    foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and    governing bodies. Most of BDs products must receive    clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart regulatory    agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold.    The process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may    take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of    substantial resources, and these have been increasing due to    increased requirements from the FDA for supporting data for    submissions. The process may also require changes to our    products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the    products. Also, governmental agencies may impose new    requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited    materials that may require us to modify or re-register products    already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market    our products in those countries. Once clearance or approval has    been obtained for a product, there is an obligation to ensure    that all applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements    continue to be met.     Following the introduction of a product, these agencies also    periodically review our manufacturing processes and product    performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable good    manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, clinical trial    and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent    the    11Table of Contents    production, marketing or sale of our products and result in    fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, closure    of manufacturing sites, seizures or recalls of products and    damage to our reputation. Recent changes in enforcement practice    by the FDA and other agencies have resulted in increased    enforcement activity, which increases the compliance risk for BD    and other companies in our industry. Product    defects could adversely affect the results of our    operations.     The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve    certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects,    unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of    risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or    other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or    safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or    required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other    countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal    of a product from the market. A recall could result in    significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to    our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.    Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also    result in product liability claims being brought against us. In    some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays    in new product approvals. We may    experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource    planning system.     We are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource    planning (ERP) system. Our ERP system is critical to    our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record    transactions, provide important information to our management    and prepare our financial statements. The design and    implementation of the new ERP system has required, and will    continue to require, the investment of significant financial and    human resources. The total cost needed to implement the new ERP    system may turn out to be more than we currently anticipate. In    addition, we may not be able to successfully implement the new    ERP system without experiencing difficulties. Any disruptions,    delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the    new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process    orders, ship products, provide services and customer support,    send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual    obligations or otherwise operate our business. Our    operations are dependent in part on patents and other    intellectual property assets.     Many of BDs businesses rely on patent, trademark and other    intellectual property assets. While we do not believe that the    loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset    would materially adversely affect BD operations, these    intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material    importance to our business. BD can lose the protection afforded    by these intellectual property assets through patent    expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Patents    attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products    expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. The    loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual    property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings,    financial condition or cash flows. In addition, competitors may    claim that BD products infringe upon their intellectual    property. Resolving any intellectual property claim can be    costly and time-consuming. Natural    disasters, war and other events could adversely affect BDs    future revenues and operating income.     Natural disasters (including pandemics), war, terrorism, labor    disruptions and international conflicts, and actions taken by    the United States and other governments, or by our customers or    suppliers, in response to such events, could cause significant    economic disruption and political and social instability in the    United States and in areas outside of the United States in which    we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for    our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and    distribution capabilities, or increase the costs for or cause    interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers.    12Table of ContentsWe need    to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.     Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to    attract and retain executives and other key employees, including    people in technical, marketing, sales and research positions.    Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons    with specialized skills, can be intense. BDs ability to    recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors,    including compensation and benefits, work location and work    environment. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain    qualified executives and employees, our business could be    adversely affected. "
2,BDX,BECTON DICKINSON & CO,2010-11-24,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and    uncertainties. The following describes some of the significant    risks that could adversely affect BDs business, financial    condition, operating results or cash flows. Current    economic conditions could adversely affect our    operations.     The current economic conditions may result in a decrease in the    demand for our products and services, longer sales cycles,    slower adoption of new technologies and increased price    competition. During fiscal year 2010, lower laboratory testing    volumes and physician visits in the United States and    macroeconomic factors in Western Europe contributed to weakened    demand for our products. Any austerity plans implemented in    Europe or other regions where governments are the primary payers    of healthcare expenses and research may also result in a    decrease in demand for our products. In addition, while the    current economic conditions have not impaired our ability to    access credit markets to date, there can be no assurance that    these conditions will not adversely affect our ability to do so    in the future. The current economic conditions may adversely    affect our suppliers, and there can be no assurances that BD    will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future.    The increase in sovereign debt during the financial crisis as a    result of governmental intervention in the world economy poses    additional risks to the global financial system and economic    recovery. We have experienced delays in collecting receivables    in Greece due to the Greek governments liquidity problems.    We may experience similar delays in other jurisdictions    experiencing liquidity problems. The strength and timing of any    economic recovery remains uncertain, and there can be no    assurance that the economic downturn will not continue to affect    our operations in the future. We are    subject to foreign currency exchange risk.     Over half of our fiscal year 2010 revenues were derived from    international operations. Our revenues outside the United    States may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign    currency exchange rates. A discussion of the financial impact of    exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we    may attempt to address any impact is contained in Item. 7,    Managements Discussion of Financial Condition and Results    of Operations. Any hedging activities in which we may engage    only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting    from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We    cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency    exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks. Federal    healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of    operations.     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the    PPACA) was enacted in March 2010. Under the PPACA,    beginning in 2013, medical device manufacturers, such as BD,    will pay a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical    devices. Sales of BD products that we estimate to be subject to    this tax represented about 80% of BDs total    U.S. revenues in fiscal year 2010. We cannot predict with    any certainty what other impact the PPACA may have on our    business. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to    hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies,    and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures.    These factors, in turn, could result in reduced demand for our    products and increased downward pricing pressure. It is also    possible that the PPACA will result in lower reimbursements    8Table of Contents    for our products. While the PPACA is intended to expand health    insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States,    the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on    sales of BDs products is uncertain at this time. Changes    in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect    the demand for our products and the prices at which they are    sold.     Our sales depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare    providers and facilities are reimbursed by government    authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for    the costs of our products. The coverage policies and    reimbursement levels of third-party payers, which can vary among    public and private sources, may affect which products customers    purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these    products in a particular jurisdiction. Legislative or    administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United    States (as part of the PPACA) or abroad (for example, those    under consideration in France, Germany, Italy and the United    Kingdom) could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures    using BD products, or result in denial of reimbursement for    those products. See Third-Party Reimbursement under    Item 1. Business. Price    volatility could adversely affect costs associated with our    operations.     Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price    volatility in the cost of raw materials, components, freight and    energy. In particular, BD purchases supplies of resins, which    are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain    products. Any significant increases in resin purchase costs    could impact future operating results. Increases in the price of    oil can also increase BDs costs for packaging and    transportation. New laws or regulations adopted in response to    climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of    certain raw materials and components. These cost increases may    adversely affect our profitability. BDs    future growth is dependent upon the development of new products,    and there can be no assurance that such products will be    developed.     A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue    growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to    patients, healthcare workers and researchers. The development of    these products requires significant research and development,    clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our    product development efforts may be affected by a number of    factors, including BDs ability to innovate, develop and    manufacture new products, complete clinical trials, obtain    regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and    abroad, or gain and maintain market approval of our products. In    addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our    commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that    any products now in development or that we may seek to develop    in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain    regulatory approval, or gain market acceptance. The    medical technology industry is very competitive.     The medical technology industry is subject to rapid    technological changes, and we face significant competition    across our product lines and in each market in which our    products are sold. We face this competition from a wide range of    companies. These include large medical device companies, some of    which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we    do. We also face competition from firms that are more    specialized than we are with respect to particular markets.    Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology    products have become manufacturers of medical devices and    instruments as well. In some instances, competitors, including    pharmaceutical companies, also offer, or are attempting to    develop, alternative therapies for disease states that may be    delivered without a medical device. The development of new or    improved products, processes or technologies by other companies    (such as needle-free injection technology) may render our    products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In    addition, increasing customer demand for more    environmentally-friendly products is creating another basis on    which BD must compete. The entry into the market of    manufacturers located in China and other low-cost manufacturing    locations is also creating increased pricing pressures,    particularly in developing markets. Some competitors have also    9Table of Contents    established manufacturing sites or have contracted with    suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their    costs. New entrants may also appear, particularly from these    low-cost countries. A    reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials    and components would adversely affect BDs manufacturing    operations and related product sales.     BD purchases many different types of raw materials and    components. Certain raw materials (primarily related to the BD    Biosciences segment) and components are not available from    multiple sources.

A more detailed description of these    lawsuits is contained in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Given    the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in    all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could    result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we    are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur    charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to    the extent available, excess liability insurance. Any such    future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could    adversely affect BDs results of operations and cash flows. Consolidation    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect BDs    future revenues and operating income.     The medical technology industry has experienced a significant    amount of consolidation. As a result of this consolidation,    competition to provide goods and services to customers has    increased. In addition, group purchasing organizations and    integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate    purchasing decisions for some customers, which has placed    pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. Further    consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on    the prices of our products. Product    defects could adversely affect the results of our    operations.     The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve    certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects,    unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of    risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or    other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or    safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or    required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other    countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal    of a product from the market. A recall could result in    significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to    our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.    Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also    result in product liability claims    10Table of Contents    being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse    events could also cause delays in new product approvals. We may    experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource    planning system.     We are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource    planning (ERP) system. Our ERP system is critical to    our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record    transactions, provide important information to our management    and prepare our financial statements. The design and    implementation of the new ERP system has required, and will    continue to require, the investment of significant financial and    human resources. The total cost needed to implement the new ERP    system may turn out to be more than we currently anticipate. In    addition, we may not be able to successfully implement the new    ERP system without experiencing difficulties. Any disruptions,    delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the    new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process    orders, ship products, provide services and customer support,    send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual    obligations or otherwise operate our business. BD is    subject to extensive regulation.     BD is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the    Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in    foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and    governing bodies. Most of BDs products must receive    clearance or approval from the FDA or    non-U.S. counterpart    regulatory agencies before they can be marketed or sold. The    process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a    significant period of time and require the expenditure of    substantial resources, and these may be increasing. The process    may also require changes to our products or result in    limitations on the indicated uses of the products. Also,    governmental agencies may impose new requirements regarding    registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require    us to modify or re-register products already on the market or    otherwise impact our ability to market our products. In    addition, once clearance or approval has been obtained for a    product, there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable    FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to be met.     Following the introduction of a product, these agencies also    periodically review our manufacturing processes and product    performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable good    manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, clinical trial    and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent    the production, marketing or sale of our products and result in    fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, closure    of manufacturing sites, seizures or recalls of products and    damage to our reputation. Recent changes in enforcement practice    by the FDA and other agencies have resulted in increased    enforcement activity, which increases the compliance risk for BD    and other companies in our industry. We cannot    guarantee that any of BDs strategic acquisitions,    investments or alliances will be successful.     While our strategy to increase revenue growth is driven    primarily by internal product development, we seek to supplement    our growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and    alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky. The success    of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a    number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and    value the potential business opportunity or to successfully    integrate it into our existing business. There can be no    assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful. The    international operations of BDs business may subject BD to    certain business risks.     BD operations outside the United States subject BD to certain    risks, including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency    exchange (as discussed above); the spread of a global economic    downturn; changes in foreign regulatory requirements; local    product preferences; difficulty in establishing, staffing and    managing foreign operations; differing labor regulations;    changes in tax laws; potential political instability; trade    barriers; weakening of the protection of intellectual property    rights in some countries; and restrictions on the transfer of    capital across borders. The success of our operations outside    the United States will depend, in part, on our    11Table of Contents    ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local    companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to,    among other things, our production facilities and distribution    networks. Reductions    in customers research budgets or government funding may    adversely affect our BD Biosciences segment.     Our BD Biosciences segment sells products to researchers at    pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic    institutions, government laboratories and private foundations.    Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate    based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. A    number of these customers are also dependent for their funding    upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the    U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and    agencies in other countries. The level of government funding of    research and development is unpredictable. There have been    instances where NIH grants have been frozen or otherwise    unavailable for extended periods. The availability of    governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely    affected by the current economic downturn. Any reduction or    delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay    or forego purchases of our products. Our    operations are dependent in part on patents and other    intellectual property assets.     Many of BDs businesses rely on patent, trademark and other    intellectual property assets. While we do not believe that the    loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset    would materially adversely affect BD operations, these    intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material    importance to our business. BD can lose the protection afforded    by these intellectual property assets through patent    expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Patents    attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products    expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. The    loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual    property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings,    financial condition or cash flows. In addition, competitors may    claim that BD products infringe upon their intellectual    property. Resolving any intellectual property claim can be    costly and time-consuming. Natural    disasters, war and other events could adversely affect BDs    future revenues and operating income.     Natural disasters (including pandemics), war, terrorism, labor    disruptions and international conflicts, and actions taken by    the United States and other governments in response to such    events, could cause significant economic disruption and    political and social instability in the United States and    in areas outside of the United States in which we operate.    These events could result in decreased demand for our products,    adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution    capabilities, or increase the costs for or cause interruptions    in the supply of materials from our suppliers. We need    to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.     Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to    attract and retain executives and other key employees, including    people in technical, marketing, sales and research positions.    Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons    with specialized skills, can be intense. BDs ability to    recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors,    including compensation and benefits, work location and work    environment. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain    qualified executives and employees, our business could be    adversely affected. "

.          An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following describessome of the significant risks that could adversely affect BDs business, financial condition,operating results or cash flows.Current economic conditions could adversely affect our operations.          The global financial crisis has caused extreme disruption in the financial markets, includingseverely diminished liquidity and credit availability. While these conditions have not impairedour ability to access credit markets to date, there can be no assurance that these conditions willnot adversely affect our ability to do so in the future, particularly if there is furtherdeterioration in the world financial markets and major economies. The current economic conditionsmay also adversely affect the business of our customers and the amount spent on healthcaregenerally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, longersales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. During 2009,the global recession weakened the demand for our products in certain areas of our business, inparticular, that of our Biosciences segment in the U.S., which was affected by a slowdown inresearch-related capital spending. The strength and timing of any economic recovery remainsuncertain, and there can be no assurance that the economic downturn will not continue to affect ouroperations in the future.          In addition, the current economic conditions may adversely affect our suppliers, such as resinsuppliers that do substantial business with the automotive industry, which could cause disruptionsin our ability to produce our products. For example, during fiscal year 2009, Lyondell ChemicalCompany and certain affiliated entities (collectively, Lyondell) filed for protection underChapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Lyondell supplies BD with medical grade resins used tomanufacture products in our BD Medical and BD Diagnostics segments. In addition, Smurfit-Stone ContainerCorp., a supplier of packaging materials, also filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.While BD has not experienced any interruption in the supply from any of its suppliers to date,there can be no assurances that BD will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future.5Table of ContentsWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.          Over half of our fiscal year 2009 revenues were derived from international operations. Ourrevenues outside the U.S. may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchangerates. During fiscal year 2009, worldwide currencies experienced extreme volatility, whichnegatively impacted our reported results. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange ratefluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to address any impact is contained inItem. 7, Managements Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our hedgingactivities may, however, only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting fromunfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certaintychanges in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks.Proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system may have a material adverse effect on us.          The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system in an effortto contain healthcare costs and increase access. Although a number of proposals have receivedvarying levels of support in Congress, there still is no consensus on a number of key issues,including coverage mandates and the establishment of a public healthcare insurance option. Severalproposals on how to finance healthcare reform are also being considered. Certain proposals wouldimpose an excise tax on medical device companies such as BD, which could go into effect as early ascalendar year 2010. While we cannot predict what healthcare legislation, if any, will be passedinto law, such legislation could, among other things, lower reimbursements for our products, reducethe volume of medical procedures or impose additional financial burdens on BD.Changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect the demand for our productsand the prices at which they are sold.          Our sales depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities arereimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for the costsof our products. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers may affectwhich products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products.Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the U.S., as part of thehealthcare reform being debated, or abroad could significantly reduce reimbursement for proceduresusing BD medical devices, or result in denial of reimbursement for those products. SeeThird-Party Reimbursement under Item 1. Business.Price volatility could adversely affect the results of our operations.          Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price volatility in the cost of rawmaterials, components, freight and energy. In particular, BD purchases supplies of resins, whichare oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products. Any significant increases inresin purchase costs could impact future operating results. Increases in the price of oil can alsoincrease BDs costs for packaging and transportation. These cost increases may adversely affectour profitability.BDs future growth is dependent upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurancethat such products will be developed.          A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on productsthat deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers. The development ofthese products requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatoryapprovals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors,including BDs ability to innovate, develop and manufacture new products, complete clinical trials,obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad, or gain and maintainmarket approval of our products. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay ourcommercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development orthat we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatoryapproval, or gain market acceptance.The medical technology industry is very competitive.          The medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes, and we facesignificant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold.We face this competition from a wide range of companies. These include large medical devicecompanies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We alsoface competition from firms that are more specialized than us withrespect to particular markets. Other firms engaged in thedistribution of medical technology products have become manufacturersof medical devices and instruments as well.In some instances, competitors,including pharmaceutical companies, also offer, or are attempting to develop, alternative therapiesfor disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. The development of new orimproved products, processes or technologies by other companies (such as needle-free injectiontechnology) may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. Inaddition, the entry into the market of manufacturers located in China and other low-costmanufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures, particularly in developingmarkets. Some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted withsuppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs. New entrants may alsoappear, particularly from these low-cost countries.6Table of ContentsA reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adverselyaffect BDs manufacturing operations and related product sales.          BD purchases many different types of raw materials and components. We have generally beenable to obtain adequate supplies of these materials. However, certain raw materials (primarilyrelated to the BD Biosciences segment) and components are not available from multiple sources. Inaddition, for quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and other reasons, BD elects to purchasecertain raw materials and components from sole suppliers. The supply of these materials can bedisrupted for a number of reasons, including  current economic conditions as described above.While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, no assurance can be given that theseefforts will be successful. In addition, where there are regulatory requirements relating to thequalification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on atimely basis. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these sole-sourced rawmaterials and components could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect BDs future revenues andoperating income.          We have manufacturing sites all over the world. In addition, in some instances, themanufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. As aresult, weather, natural disasters (including pandemic disease), terrorism, political change, ordamage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture ourproducts.BD is subject to a number of pending lawsuits.          BD is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuitsfor alleged antitrust violations and product liability, and could be subject to additional lawsuitsin the future. A more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in Item 3. LegalProceedings. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases toestimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of thelitigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges inexcess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liabilityinsurance. Any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect BDsresults of operations and cash flows.Consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect BDs future revenues and operatingincome.          The medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation.

.     An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect BDs business, financial condition,operating results or cash flows.Current economic conditions could adversely affect our operations.      Financial markets in the United States and abroad have experienced extreme disruption, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. While these conditions and the currenteconomic downturn have not impaired our ability to access credit markets or adversely affected our operations to date, there can be no assurance that these conditions will not adversely affect our business in the future, particularly if there isfurther deterioration in the world financial markets and major economies.  The current conditions may also adversely affect the business of our customers and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand forour products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.  In addition, these conditions may adversely affect our suppliers, such as resin suppliers that do substantial business with theautomotive industry, which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products. Inflation could adversely affect the results of our operations.     Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflation in the cost of raw materials, components, freight and energy. In particular, BD purchases supplies of resins, which areoil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products. Any significant increases in resin purchase costs could impact future operating results. Increases in the price of oil can also increase BDs costs for packaging andtransportation. If we are unable to mitigate these cost increases, our profitability may be adversely affected. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.     Over half of our fiscal year 2008 revenues were derived from international operations. Our revenues outside the U.S. may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchangerates.  Recently, worldwide currencies have experienced extreme volatility. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the headingFinancial Instrument Market Risk under Financial Review contained in Exhibit 13, which is incorporated herein by reference.  We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree towhich we can mitigate these risks. 6 BDs future growth is dependent upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed.      A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers.

A more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result froman unfavorable7 outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance.  Any suchfuture charges, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely effect BDs results of operations and cash flows. Consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect BDs future revenues and operating income.     The medical device industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation.  As a result of this consolidation, competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased.  Inaddition, group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers.

The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products. Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systemsin the U.S. or abroad could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using BD medical devices, or result in denial of reimbursement for those products. See Third-Party Reimbursement under Item 1. Business.Product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations.      The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risksrelating to the use of the product can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in othercountries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. Any recall could result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products. Personalinjuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals. We may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system.      We have initiated a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Our ERP system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records, recordtransactions, provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements. The design and implementation of the new ERP system will require the investment of significant financial and human resources. The total cost neededto implement the new ERP system may turn out to be more than we currently anticipate.  In addition, we may not be able to successfully implement the new ERP system without experiencing difficulties.  Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in thedesign and implementation of the new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate ourbusiness, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.BD is subject to extensive regulation.     BD is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governingbodies. Most of BDs products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart non-U.S. regulatory agencies before they can be marketed or sold. The process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significantperiod of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources. The process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products. In addition, regulatory requirements outside the U.S. changefrequently, requiring prompt action to maintain compliance, particularly when product modifications are required.8      Following the introduction of a product, these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable goodmanufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production, marketing or sale of our products and result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances,closure of manufacturing sites, seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation.We cannot guarantee that any of BDs strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.      While our strategy to increase revenue growth is driven primarily by internal product development, we will seek to supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions, investments andalliances. Such transactions are inherently risky. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or tosuccessfully integrate it into our existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful.The international operations of BDs business may subject BD to certain business risks.      BD operations outside the U.S. subject BD to certain risks, including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange (as discussed above), the spread of a global economic downturn,changes in foreign regulatory requirements, potential political instability, trade barriers, weakening of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders. The success ofour operations outside the U.S. will depend, in part, on our ability to acquire or form alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to, among other things, our production facilities and distribution networks.Reductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our BD Biosciences segment.      Our BD Biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations. Research anddevelopment spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. A number of these customers are also dependent upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. National Institutes ofHealth (NIH), and agencies in other countries for their funding. The level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable, and may be adversely affected by the current economic downturn. In addition, there have beeninstances where NIH grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods. Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products.Our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property rights.      Many of BDs businesses rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights. While we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset wouldmaterially adversely affect BD operations, these intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. BD can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legalchallenges or governmental action. Patents attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. The loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual propertyassets may have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition or cash flows.Natural disasters, war and other events could adversely affect BDs future revenues and operating income.     Natural disasters, pandemics, war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts, and actions taken by the United States and other governments in response to such events, could causesignificant economic disruption and political and social instability in the U.S. and in areas outside of the U.S. in which we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing anddistribution capabilities, or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers. 9 We need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.      Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees, including people in technical, marketing, sales and research positions.Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with specialized skills, can be intense. The Companys ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location andwork environment. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees, our business could be adversely affected"

.      An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect BDs business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.BDs future growth is dependent upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed.        A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers. The development of these products requiressignificant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including BDs ability to innovate, develop and manufacture new products,complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad, or gain and maintain market approval of our products. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of aproduct. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval, or gain market acceptance.The medical device industry is very competitive.      The medical device industry is subject to rapid technological changes, and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold. We face this competition from a widerange of companies. These include large medical device companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than us. We also face competition from firms that are more specialized than us with respect to particular markets.Non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, also offer alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. See Competition under Item 1. Business. The development of new orimproved products, processes or technologies by other companies may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive.  In addition, some competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers locatedin China and other low-cost manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs. New entrants may also appear, particularly from these low-cost countries.Inflation and fluctuations in the      cost of raw materials could adversely affect the results of our operations.     It is    possible that general inflation rates will rise in 2008 and beyond, and could    have a greater impact on worldwide economies and, consequently, on BD. BD    purchases supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the    manufacture of certain products. Any significant increases in resin purchase    costs could impact future operating results. A reduction or interruption in the      supply of certain raw materials would adversely affect BDs manufacturing      operations and related product sales.        BD purchases many different types of raw materials. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of these materials. However, certain raw materials (primarily related to the BD Biosciences segment) are notavailable from multiple sources. In addition, for quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and other reasons, BD elects to purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers. While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, no assurance canbe given that these efforts will be successful. In addition, where there are regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement5sources on a timely basis. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these sole-sourced raw materials could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products. Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect BDs future revenues and operating income.       We have manufacturing sites all over the world. In addition, in some instances, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. As a result, natural disasters (includingpandemic disease), political change, or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.BD is subject to a number of pending lawsuits.      BD is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and product liability, and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future. A moredetailed description of these lawsuits is contained in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcomeof the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. Any such future charges, individually or inthe aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BDs results of operations and cash flows.Consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect BDs future revenues and operating income.       The medical device industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation. As a result of this consolidation, competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased. In addition, group purchasingorganizations (GPOs) and integrated health delivery networks (IDNs) have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. Further consolidation inthe industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products. Changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold.       Our sales depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for the costs of our products. The coveragepolicies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products. Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the U.S. or abroad in amanner could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using BD medical devices, or result in denial of reimbursement for those products. See Third-Party Reimbursement under Item 1. Business. Product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations.        The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of theproduct can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, incertain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. Any recall could result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also resultin product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals.BD is subject to extensive regulation.      BD is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Most of BDsproducts must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart non-U.S. regulatory agencies before they can be marketed or sold.

Such transactions areinherently risky. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate it into our existingbusiness. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.      Over half of our fiscal year 2007 revenues were derived from international operations. Our revenues outside the U.S. are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A discussion of the financial impact ofexchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading Financial Instrument Market Risk under Financial Review contained in Exhibit 13, which isincorporated herein by reference. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates.The international operations of BDs business may subject BD to certain business risks.        BD operations outside the U.S. subject BD to certain risks, including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange (as discussed above), changes in foreign regulatory requirements, potential politicalinstability, trade barriers, weakening of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders.
