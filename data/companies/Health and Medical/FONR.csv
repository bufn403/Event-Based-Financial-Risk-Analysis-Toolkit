3,FONR,FONAR CORP,2022-09-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our securities is subject tovarious risks, the most significant of which are summarized below. 1.Reduced Reimbursement Rates. Most of our revenues are derived from our scanning center businessconducted by HMCA. We are experiencing lower reimbursement rates from Medicare, other government programs and private insurancecompanies. To date, we have been able to counter the impact of these reductions by increasing our volume of scans notwithstandingthe Covid-19 pandemic, and reducing our operating expenses, thereby maintaining profitability in this business segment. There is,however, no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. 2.Demand for MRI Scanners. The reduced reimbursement rates also affects our sales of MRI scannersnegatively. With lower revenue projections, prospective customers would demand lower prices for scanners. Although the reducedreimbursements may not affect foreign demand, a lower number of sales in the aggregate could reduce economies of scale and consequently,profit margins.  3.Manufacturing Competition. Many if not most of our competing scanner manufacturers have significantlygreater financial resources, production capacity, and other resources than we do. Such competitors would include General Electric,Siemens, Hitachi and Phillips. Although Fonar is the only company which can manufacture and sell the unique Stand-Up® (Upright®)MRI scanner, potential customers must be convinced that the purchase of a Fonar scanner is their best choice. We believe that withtime, that objective will be reached, particularly with customers scanning patients having neck, back, knee and various orthopedicissues who would benefit from being scanned in weight-bearing positions.  4.Dependence on Referrals. HMCA derives substantially all of its revenue, directly or indirectly,from fees charged for the diagnostic imaging services performed at the facilities. We depend on referrals of patients from unaffiliatedphysicians and other third parties to the facilities we manage or own for the services we perform. If these physicians and otherthird parties were to reduce the number of patients they refer or discontinue referring patients, scan volumes could decrease,which would reduce our net revenue and operating margins. Page 30   FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 5.Pressure to Control Healthcare Costs. One of the principal objectives of health maintenance organizationsand preferred provider organizations is to control the cost of healthcare services. Healthcare providers participating in managedcare plans may be required to refer diagnostic imaging tests to certain providers depending on the plan in which a covered patientis enrolled. In addition, managed care contracting has become very competitive. The expansion of health maintenance organizations,preferred provider organizations and other managed care organizations within New York or Florida could have a negative impact onthe utilization and pricing of services performed at the facilities HMCA manages or owns to the extent these organizations exertcontrol over patients’ access to diagnostic imaging services, selections of the provider of such services and reimbursementrates for those services.  6.Scanning Facility Competition. The market for diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive.The facilities we manage or own compete for patients on the basis of reputation, location and the quality of diagnostic imagingservices. Groups of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that own and operate imagingequipment are the principal competitors.  7.Eligibility Changes to Insurance Programs. Due to potential decreased availability of healthcarethrough private employers, the number of patients who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. Healthcarereform legislation will increase the participation of individuals in the Medicaid program in states that elect to participate inthe expanded Medicaid coverage. A shift in payor mix from managed care and other private payors to government payors or an increasein the number of uninsured patients may result in a reduction in the rates of reimbursement or an increase in uncollectible receivablesor uncompensated care, with a corresponding decrease in net revenue. Policies now being offered under various insurance plans areexpected to reduce demand for MRI scans as they become less affordable. Changes in the eligibility requirements for governmentalprograms such as the Medicaid program and state decisions on whether to participate in the expansion of such programs also couldincrease the number of patients who participate in such programs and the number of uninsured patients. Even for those patientswho remain in private insurance plans, changes to those plans could increase patient financial responsibility, resulting in a greaterrisk of uncollectible receivables. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,and results of operations. 8.Possible changes in Florida Insurance Law. In early 2019, two senate bills and one house bill inFlorida were introduced, all of them calling for the repeal of PIP and replacing PIP with $25,000 Bodily Injury Coverage and PropertyDamage Liability Coverage. Another Florida senate bill was introduced that would preserve PIP but dramatically cut reimbursementrates. None of the proposed bills made it onto the 2019 legislative agenda. During Fonar’s fiscal 2021, the Florida houseand senate reached an agreement and passed similar legislation. It was, however, vetoed by the Governor. We cannot predict whethersuch efforts by the Florida legislature will continue or be successful. Currently, drivers and passengers get car damages and PIP,paid for up to $10,000, no matter who is at fault in an accident. Drivers have to pay an additional cost to insurance companiesto pay for bodily injuries which covers them if they are at fault. While PIP is required, coverage for bodily injury is not. Page 31   FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Over the past several years there have been various bills introduced by a number of Florida legislatorsto eliminate PIP and instead mandate coverage including some combination of a minimum of bodily injury and a reduced or no amountof medical payments (Medpay coverage). Eliminating PIP would mean that the $10,000 drivers now get paid toward medical costs throughtheir insurers might not be there for them to pay for injured drivers. Importantly, payments would be reduced by approximately60% due to claims being paid at commercial rates or through legal settlements instead of at the presently prevailing PIP fee schedule.This would negatively impact our Florida diagnostic imaging facilities (both those we own and those we manage) with more unpaidbills, lower reimbursement rates and elongated waiting times. To date proponents of these changes have been unsuccessful.  9.Federal and state privacy and information security laws. We must comply with numerous federal andstate laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and privacy of PHI, including HIPAA andits implementing privacy and security regulations, as amended by the federal HITECH Act. If we fail to comply with applicable privacyand security laws, regulations and standards, properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to oursystems, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cashflows could be materially and adversely affected. Information security risks have significantlyincreased because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conductour operations, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties,including foreign state agents. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietaryand other information in our computer systems and networks. 10.COVID-19. Although we believe we have taken the proper steps and made a good recovery from theimpact of the first wave of the COVID-19 virus, new strains of the disease have developed and future variants may continue to develop.The relatively recent new variants are particularly contagious and coupled with New York State requirements that medical employeesmust be vaccinated if they care for patients, including our technicians and support staff caring for scanning patients, has resultedin fewer available employees and adversely affected our ability to staff a full number of shifts. The course and severity of thevirus in the following months, and the ultimate economic and medical impact it will have worldwide and at home, is uncertain. 11.Other changes in Domestic and Worldwide Economic Conditions. We are subject to risk arising fromadverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown and disruption ofcredit markets. Turbulence and uncertainty in the United States and international markets and economies may adversely affect ourliquidity, financial condition, revenues, profitability and business operations generally. Page 32   FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES "

2,FONR,FONAR CORP,2007-10-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSAn  investment  in Fonar is highly  speculative  and subject to a high degree ofrisk.  Therefore,  you should  carefully  consider the risks discussed below andother  information  contained in this annual report before deciding to invest inshares of our common stock.1. In the past we have  experienced  significant  losses  and may in the  futureincur losses.For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, we  experienced  netlosses  of  $25.5  million  and  $30.0  million  respectively  and  losses  fromoperations of $25.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively.As of June 30, 2007, our  consolidated  balance sheet  reflected $1.5 million incash and cash equivalents and $2.0 million in marketable securities out of totalcurrent  assets of $23.0  million as compared  to $4.6  million in cash and cashequivalents  and $4.9  million in  marketable  securities  out of total  currentassets of $38.9 million as of June 30, 2006, reflecting a decrease in cash, cashequivalents  and  marketable  securities.  As of June 30, 2007, we had a workingcapital  deficit of $7.6  million as  compared to a working  capital  surplus of$14.2 million as of June 30, 2006. We believe that we will be able to reduce ouroperating loss and generate  operating income by continuing the marketing of ournew MRI scanners, particularly our Upright(TM) MRI scanners.2. Fonar is dependant on the success of its new products to become profitable.Our ability to generate future  operating  profits will depend on our ability tomarket and sell our MRI products. The Upright(TM) MRI and Fonar 360 MRI scannershave been  introduced  into the market.  Although we are  optimistic  that thesescanners'  features  will  make  them  competitive,  and we  perceive  that  theUpright(TM) MRI is successfully  penetrating the market,  notwithstanding  lowersales in fiscal  2007 and  2006,  there can be no  assurance  as to the  degree,timing or  continuation of market  acceptance of these products.  The product weare promoting most vigorously is the Upright(TM) MRI. We believe the Upright(TM)MRI is the most  promising  because it enables scans to be performed on patientsin  weight  bearing  positions,  such  as  sitting,  standing  or  lying  at  anintermediate angle or in any of the conventional recumbent positions. We sold onFonar 360 MRI scanner in fiscal 2005.3. We must  compete in a highly  competitive  market  against  competitors  withgreater financial resources than we have.The  medical  equipment  industry is highly  competitive  and  characterized  byrapidly changing  technology and extensive research and development.  The marketdemand for a continuing  supply of new and improved products requires that we beengaged  continuously  in research and  development.  New products  also requirecontinuous retooling or at least modifications to our manufacturing  facilities,and our sales and marketing force must  continuously  adjust to new products andproduct  features.  This is highly  expensive and companies  with  substantiallygreater  financial  resources  than we have engage in the  marketing of magneticresonance   imaging   scanners  which  compete  with  the  Company's   scanners.Competitors include large,  multinational  companies or their affiliates such asGeneral Electric Company,  Siemens A.G., Philips N.V.,  Toshiba  Corporation andHitachi  Corporation.  There can be no assurance  that Fonar's  products will beable to successfully compete with products of its competitors.4. HMCA's  profitability  depends on its ability to successfully perform billingand collection services for its clients.HMCA performs billing and collection services for the facilities it manages. Theviability of HMCA's clients and their ability to remit  management  fees to HMCAdepends on HMCA's ability to collect the clients' receivables. Collectibility ofthese  receivables  can be adversely  affected by the longer  payment cycles andrigorous  informational  requirements of some insurance companies or other thirdparty payors. Proper authorizations,  referrals and confirmation of coverage forpatients, as well as issues of medical necessity,  need to be addressed prior tothe rendering of service to assure prompt payment of claims. HMCA believes it isproperly  addressing  billing  and  collection  requirements  and issues for itsclients and that its collection  rates are good.  Nevertheless,  the regulationsand requirements  applicable to medical billing and collections  could change inthe future and result in reduced or delayed collections.5. The  profitability of HMCA could be adversely  affected if medical  insurancereimbursement rates change.All  HMCA's   revenue  is  now  generated   from   providers  of  MRI  services.Consequently,  HMCA would be indirectly affected by changes in medical insurancereimbursement  policies,  referral patterns,  no-fault and workers  compensationreimbursement  levels and other factors  affecting the  profitability  of an MRIfacility.  There are currently 12 MRI  facilities  served by HMCA located in NewYork,  Florida and Georgia.  Approximately  33.1% of HMCA's clients' revenues infiscal 2007, 43% of HMCA's clients'  revenues in fiscal 2006 and 59.3% in fiscal2005 were generated from no-fault claims.  Approximately 4.8% of HMCA's clients'revenues  were from workers'  compensation  claims in fiscal 2007 as compared to4.1% in fiscal  2006 and 6.2% in  fiscal  2005.  In  addition,  in fiscal  2007,approximately  20.1% of the  revenues of HMCA's  clients  were  attributable  toMedicare and 1.6% were attributable to Medicaid.  In fiscal 2006,  approximately18.2% of the revenues of HMCA's clients were  attributable  to Medicare and 1.1%were  attributable  to  Medicaid.  In  fiscal  2005,  approximately  9.9% of therevenues  of  HMCA's  clients  were  attributable  to  Medicare  and  0.5%  wereattributable to Medicaid.  The Deficit  Reduction Act has had a negative but notmaterial effect on the Medicare  receipts of HMCA's  clients.  Future changes inthe reimbursement levels for MRI, workers  compensation,  no fault reimbursementor Medicare,  or changes in  utilization  policies for MRI also could  adverselyaffect the  ability of HMCA's  clients to pay HMCA's  fees.  In  addition,  HMCAdepends on the ability of its clients to attract and retain physicians and otherprofessional staff.6.  Professional  liability  claims  against  HMCA  or its  clients  may  exceedinsurance coverage levels.Although HMCA does not provide medical  services,  it is possible that a patientsuing  one of  HMCA's  MRI  facilities  would  also sue  HMCA.  All of HMCA's 12currently  managed MRI facilities carry  professional  liability  insurance.  Inaddition,  physicians  working  for HMCA's  clients,  are  required  to maintainprofessional liability insurance in the minimum amount of $1,000,000/$3,000,000.Such insurance would not cover HMCA, which is not insured,  and claims in excessof insurance  coverage  might also have to be satisfied by HMCA if it were namedas a defendant.7. We are dependent upon the services of Dr. Damadian.Our success is greatly dependent upon the continued participation of Dr. RaymondV. Damadian,  Fonar's founder, Chairman of the Board and President. Dr. Damadianhas acted as our CEO since 1978 and will  continue to do so for the  foreseeablefuture. In addition to providing general supervision and direction,  he providesactive  direction,  supervision  and  management  of our  sales,  marketing  andresearch and  development  efforts.  Loss of the services of Dr.  Damadian wouldhave a material adverse effect on our business.  We do not have an employment ornoncompetition  agreement with Dr. Damadian. We do not currently carry ""key man""life insurance on Dr. Damadian.8. Dr. Raymond V. Damadian has voting control of Fonar; the management cannot bechanged or the Company sold without his agreement.Dr.  Raymond V.  Damadian,  the  President,  Chairman of the Board and principalstockholder  of Fonar is and will  continue  to be in  control of Fonar and in aposition to elect all of the directors of Fonar. As of September 14, 2007, therewere outstanding  4,894,207  shares of common stock,  having one vote per share,158  shares of Class B common  stock,  having  ten  votes per share and  382,513shares of Class C common stock,  having 25 votes per share.  Of these totals Dr.Damadian  owns  120,302  shares of common  stock and  382,447  shares of Class Ccommon stock, giving him approximately 67% of the voting power of Fonar's votingstock.  This means that the holders of the common stock other than Dr.  Damadianwill not be able to control  decisions  concerning  any merger or sale of Fonar,the  election of  directors  or the  determination  of business  and  managementpolicy"
