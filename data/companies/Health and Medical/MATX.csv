5,MATX,MATSON INC,2024-02-23,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS​The following material risks, events and uncertainties may make an investment in the Company speculative or risky and should be reviewed carefully.  The Company faces the material risks set forth below; however, the description below does not purport to include all risks the Company faces, and additional risks or uncertainties that are currently unknown or are not currently believed to be material may occur or become material.  The occurrence of these or the risks and uncertainties described below may, in ways the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or mitigate, adversely affect the Company’s business, competitive environment, strategy, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, demand, revenue, growth, prospects, reputation or stock price.  All forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K are qualified by the risks and uncertainties described below.​13Table of ContentsRisks Related to the Jones Act  ​Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or changes in its application would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.​The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act) regulates all interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S.  If the Jones Act were to be repealed, substantially amended or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flagged and foreign-built vessels and/or being exempt from other U.S. regulations, the Company’s business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Company’s position as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels would be negatively impacted if periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act were successful.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flagged or foreign-built vessels, which could have other adverse impacts to our business.​The Company’s business would be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.​Certain provisions of the Company’s articles of incorporation protect the Company’s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  If non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own, in the aggregate, more than 25 percent of the Company’s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Company’s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against the Company, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels.​Risks Related to the Company’s Operations​Changes in macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical developments, or governmental policies, including due to outbreaks of disease, have affected and could in the future affect the Company. ​The transportation industry in which the Company operates has been and could in the future be impacted by macroeconomic fluctuations, volatility, downturns, inflation, recessions, rising interest rates and other economic shifts or market instabilities, including due to outbreaks of disease and instability in financial institutions, as well as the development of and changes in governmental policies, relations, priorities and budgeting constraints, and uncertainties resulting from the U.S. political environment, including increased political polarization and the potential for political gridlock (such as the prospect of a shutdown of the U.S. federal government), and geopolitical developments across the jurisdictions in which it operates.  For example, there have been increases in geopolitical and trade tensions among a number of the world’s major economies.  These tensions have resulted in the implementation of tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and sanctions, including the use of export control restrictions and sanctions against certain countries and individual companies, which have, and may continue to have, an adverse economic impact in the markets in which the Company operates and could result in a reduced demand for the Company’s services. ​These adverse economic conditions may also impact the Company’s customers’ business levels and needs.  Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, Alaska and Guam, which include tourism, military spending, construction, personal income growth and employment, the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, the economy in the U.S. Mainland, inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary fears, increased political polarization and the potential for political gridlock (such as the prospect of a shutdown of the U.S. federal government), and the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies has reduced and could in the future reduce the demand for goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, pressure from U.S. or foreign governments, imposition of tariffs and uncertainties regarding tariff rates or a change in international trade policies could adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company’s China services.  Additionally, fluctuations in the price of oil could further impact the Alaskan economy, which in turn could impact the Company’s business.​14Table of ContentsThe shipping industry is competitive, and the Company has been and may continue to be impacted by new or increased competition.​The Company has faced and may continue to face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter into the Company’s markets.  The shipping industry is competitive with limited barriers to entry, especially in international tradelanes.  Ocean carriers can shift vessels in and out of tradelanes or charter vessels to manage capacity and meet customer demands.  The Company also competes with air freight carriers some of which are able to offer more attractive schedules and services, or to increase capacity.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competitors on any of the Company’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s volumes and rates.​The loss of or damage to key customer relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business.​The Company’s businesses are dependent on their relationships with customers and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company’s largest customers.  The Company’s business relies on its relationships with the U.S. military, freight forwarders and non-vessel owning common carriers, large retailers and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  For more information regarding the Company’s significant customers, see the discussion in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. ​The Company could also be adversely affected by any changes in the services, or changes to the costs of services, provided by third-party vendors such as railroads, truckers, terminals, agents and shipping companies, including charter vessel owners.  Service structures and relationships with these parties are important in the Company’s intermodal business, as well as in the China, Guam, Micronesia, Japan, Alaska export and South Pacific services. ​The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business and revenue.​The Company is dependent upon key vendors and third parties for equipment, capacity, facilities, infrastructure and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected.​The Company’s businesses are dependent upon key vendors who provide terminal, rail, truck, and ocean transportation services.  If the Company cannot reliably secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third parties at reasonable prices or rates to meet its or its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.  If this were to occur, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.​An increase in fuel prices, changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, and/or the cost or limited availability of required fuels may adversely affect the Company’s profits.​Fuel, including LNG fuels and biofuels, is a significant operating expense for the Company’s Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control, including impacts from global macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  Any such increases also can lead to increases in other expenses, such as energy costs and costs to purchase outside transportation services.  In the Company’s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel-related surcharges, although increases in the fuel-related surcharges may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, including recovery of all or most fuel-related expenses, also may adversely affect its results of operations. ​The development of alternative fuels (such as low- or carbon-neutral fuels), including the necessary infrastructure and technology to utilize such fuels, is still in early experimental stages.  There is significant uncertainty as to when, if at all, these alternative fuels will become commercially available or viable, and whether Matson will be able to utilize or have access to these alternative fuels (or any such alternative fuels developed in the future) in a timely and cost-effective manner.  In addition, advances in fuel technology could require Matson to incur significant capital costs to utilize any such technologies (including, for example, efforts to accelerate building of new vessels, retrofit existing vessels, retire 15Table of Contentsvessels early or make reserve vessels unusable) and Matson may be unable to equip its vessels with these technologies on a timely basis, if at all.​Evolving regulations and stakeholder expectations related to sustainability matters exposes the Company to heightened scrutiny, additional costs, operational challenges and a number of risks.​The SEC and other regulators, investors, advisory firms, employees, customers, suppliers, governments and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on and have established regulations and expectations related to sustainability matters and related corporate practices, disclosures and initiatives.  These evolving regulations and expectations may impact the Company’s reputation, business and attractiveness as an investment, employer or business partner to the extent the Company – including its initiatives, goals and reporting – fails to satisfy or is perceived to fail to satisfy those regulations and expectations, including as a result of any third-party rating or assessment.  The adoption and expansion of related legislation and regulations have also resulted and may again result in increased capital expenditures and compliance, operational and other costs to the Company.  For example, the state of California has adopted new climate change disclosure requirements.  Compliance with such rules could require significant effort and resources and result in changes to the Company’s current GHG emission reduction goals. ​The Company’s public disclosures on its climate, sustainability, human capital and other initiatives include its goals or expectations with respect to those matters, including GHG emission reduction targets.  These disclosures are aspirational and based on standards and frameworks for presenting and measuring progress that are not harmonized and are still developing, assumptions that may change, disclosure controls and procedures that continue to evolve, and with respect to our GHG emissions targets, dependent in part on the industry’s successful and timely development of alternative fuels and technologies.  The Company’s use of disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others.  This may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between the Company and other companies in the same industry.  The Company’s initiatives and goals may not be favored by certain stakeholders and could impact the attraction and retention of investors, customers and employees, as well as the Company’s willingness to do business with other companies or customers or their willingness to do business with the Company.  Efforts to achieve or accurately track the Company’s initiatives and goals face numerous risks and may be untimely, be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays, and as a result may have an adverse impact on the Company, including its brand, reputation, financial performance and growth and stock price, and may expose the Company to increased scrutiny from the investment community as well as enforcement authorities.​The Company may not be timely or successful in completing its fleet upgrade initiatives, which may result in significant costs and adversely impact the Company’s ability to meet its climate goals.​The Company’s four new Aloha and Kanaloa class vessels include dual fuel capable engines that can run on low sulfur fuel oil or LNG.  The Company has completed the installation of tanks, piping and cryogenic equipment on Daniel K. Inouye to operate on LNG; begun re-engining Manukai; and announced plans for LNG installations on Kaimana Hila in 2024.  In addition, the Company has announced plans to construct three new LNG-ready Aloha Class vessels.  The Company anticipates making significant capital expenditures in connection with these fleet initiatives.  These initiatives may be hindered by substantial delays and long lead times for necessary equipment, including as a result of ongoing supply chain congestion, increased demand across the industry for LNG installations and conversions, and new ship-building.  Additional operating costs may be incurred to the extent additional ships are needed to maintain schedule integrity while such updates and installations are performed.  Once completed, operation of these vessels may be slowed to the extent they present new maintenance requirements or unforeseen complications. ​The Company’s investments in LNG-ready vessels, whether on their own or in addition to other Company initiatives, may be insufficient to meet the Company’s previously announced GHG emission reduction goals on a timely basis or at all.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure LNG via bunker barges or other methods on the U.S. West Coast or in China in sufficient amounts to fuel its vessels or at a reasonable cost, as increased demand for LNG could decrease available supply of LNG and increase prices.  Governments have in the past and may again in the future impose tariffs on LNG that also may increase supply costs.  As a result of these risks, the Company may not fully realize the benefits of these investments. ​16Table of ContentsThe Company’s vessel construction agreements with Philly Shipyard subject the Company to risks.​On November 1, 2022, MatNav and Philly Shipyard entered into vessel construction agreements pursuant to which Philly Shipyard will construct three new 3,600-TEU Aloha Class dual-fuel capable containerships, with expected delivery dates during the fourth quarter of 2026 and subsequent deliveries currently expected in the second and fourth quarters of 2027.  Failure of any party to the vessel construction agreements to fulfill its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.  Such a failure could happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) delivery delays, (ii) delivery of vessels that fail to meet any of the required operating specifications (for example, capacity, fuel efficiency or speed), (iii) events in South Korea that prevent one or more significant subcontractors to Philly Shipyard from performing, (iv) loss of key personnel at either Philly Shipyard or any of its subcontractors, (v) work stoppages or other labor disruptions that may occur as a result of the failure of Philly Shipyard to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with its unions, or (vi) the insolvency of, or the refusal or inability to perform for any reason, by Philly Shipyard or any of its subcontractors.  Significant delays in the delivery of the new vessels could limit our ability to replace aging vessels in the Alaska service without substantial modifications and delay the Company’s ability to upsize the CLX service, which could also have an adverse impact on our business plans, financial condition and results of operations.​The Company’s operations are susceptible to weather, natural disasters, maritime accidents, spill events and other physical and operating risks, including those arising from climate change.​As a maritime transportation company, the Company’s operations are vulnerable to delay, disruptions and loss of life and property as a result of weather, natural disasters and other climate-driven events, such as rising temperatures and heat waves, rising sea levels, bad weather at sea (including increased storm severity), lightning strikes, wildfires, lava flows, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, droughts, windstorms, floods and earthquakes.  Climate change has increased and may continue to increase the frequency, severity and uncertainty of such events.  For example, sea level rise could potentially impact coastal and other low-lying areas, cause erosion of shorelines, higher water tables and increased flooding, which could damage the Company’s vessels, terminals or facilities.  In addition, the Company’s customers and the island communities it serves throughout the Pacific are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and severe storms, which may drive inhabitants away from these regions and reduce demand for the Company’s services in the affected areas and adversely impact our business.​The Company’s operations are also vulnerable to risks related to the operation of ocean-going vessels, including risks of potential marine accidents, or disasters, including grounding, fires, explosions, collisions, mechanical failures, human error, maintenance issues, latent defects, oil or other spill or environmental accidents, whale strikes, war, terrorism and piracy, lost or damaged cargo, delays, injury and loss of life.  These risks could be exacerbated by severe weather or other climate-driven events.  Changing macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including geopolitical conflict, may also result increased attacks on vessels, piracy or terrorism.​Such events could interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, require evacuation of personnel or stoppage of services or impact the Company’s customer’s operations, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal operations and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes.  These impacts could be particularly acute in ports such as Dutch Harbor and Kodiak, Alaska where the Company is dependent on a single crane.  The Company’s vessels and their cargoes, terminals and other facilities are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error.​The occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of terminals, port facilities and infrastructure, vessels, containers, cargo and other equipment, increased maintenance expense, loss of life or physical injury to its employees or people, pollution, or the slow down or suspension of operations.  For example, damage to the Company’s vessels could require repair at a dry-docking facility.  The costs of repairs may be substantial which may adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition.  Further, the Company may be unable to find space at a suitable dry-docking facility, the vessels may be forced to wait for space or be towed to a different facility, all of which could result in additional expenses and delays, and may adversely affect the Company’s business.​These events can also expose the Company to reputational harm and liability for resulting damages, including for loss of life and property, and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer.  Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for 17Table of Contentsincome-generating activity.  Furthermore, the Port of Alaska requires upgrades to its port facilities and infrastructure to improve operational safety and efficiency, accommodate modern shipping operations and improve resiliency, as well as to mitigate the risk of failure due to corrosion or loss of load bearing capacity.  As a result, there is an increased risk that an earthquake or other natural disaster could damage or render inoperable, in whole or in part, port facilities and infrastructure at the Port of Alaska.  This, in turn, could adversely affect transportation volumes or rates in Alaska and adversely impact the Company’s Ocean Transportation business and Span Alaska’s freight forwarding business, particularly given the Alaskan economy’s dependence on this port for ocean cargo.​There is no assurance that our efforts to mitigate the impact of these risks, including from severe weather or other climate-driven events on our operations, will be effective.  Although we take measures that we believe are reasonable to mitigate these risks, it is not practicable to eliminate such risks altogether.  The Company’s casualty and liability insurance policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles and may not cover all losses the Company may incur.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally are not insured.  In some cases, the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.​The Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change.​The Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change and the global shift toward a low carbon future.  Organizational, industrial and governmental shifts in operations as well as legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or eliminate emissions and/or increase efficiency may require the Company to increase expenditures, make changes to existing infrastructure, vessels and equipment, limit the speed at which the Company’s vessels are permitted to travel, and make other changes to its business model.  For example, the maritime industry is moving toward deployment of clean energy technologies and use of electricity powered by renewable energy sources to power terminal operations as a way to reduce shoreside GHG emissions.  As the Company and SSAT increase their reliance on the power grid at terminals, including for cold-ironing and ground service fleets, the Company may experience increased risks related to power outages, brown outs or black outs.  The likelihood of these risks is compounded by uncertainties regarding the reliability of renewable energy sources as well as any increased frequency of extreme weather events that may disrupt the generation or transmission of electricity.​In addition, compliance with new climate change requirements or regulations such as the IMO’s requirements related to EEXI and CII, may create schedule disruptions and could require Matson’s fleet to slow down if efficiency improvements or transitions to alternative fuels together are not enough to reduce GHG emissions sufficiently, thus impacting Matson’s expedited business model and competitive advantage.​New environmental requirements for vessel performance and operation could also require the Company to accelerate the building of new vessels, increase the construction costs for new vessels and equipment to accommodate even newer technology as it emerges while today’s technology becomes obsolete, initiate unexpected retrofit projects for existing vessels, retire older vessels earlier than expected, or render reserve vessels unusable.  If these outcomes were to occur, the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.​The Company faces risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics, outbreaks of disease, pandemics or other major health crises, which could significantly disrupt the Company’s business.​The Company’s business could be impacted adversely by outbreaks of disease, the effects of public health epidemics, pandemics or other major heath crises (which the Company refers to collectively as public health crises).  Actual or threatened public health crises may have a number of adverse impacts, including volatility in the global economy, impacts to the Company’s customers’ business operations, reduced tourism in the markets the Company serves, potential restrictions on employee travel, or significant disruptions in ocean-borne transportation of goods, logistics demand and supply chain activity, caused by a variety of factors such as quarantines, factory and office closures, port closures, or other government-imposed restrictions, any of which could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  In addition, the Company’s business and operations has in the past, and could in the future, be impacted by outbreaks of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  For instance, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s operations faced risks from employees potentially being restricted from or unable to perform their duties, the Company’s or SSAT’s terminals potentially being temporarily closed, or potential outbreaks aboard the Company’s vessels that could cause the Company to miss port calls.  As the COVID-19 18Table of Contentspandemic subsided, supply and demand trends have normalized and the high volumes and rates the Company previously experienced in its China service have declined, however, certain fixed costs remain.  Additionally, the global macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts on the Company’s customers’ business operations, including financial difficulties or bankruptcies, may continue to persist for an indefinite period.​The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be renewed/replaced on less favorable terms or may not be renewed/replaced on acceptable terms, if at all.​The significant operating agreements and leases entered into by the Company in the course of its operations, including those related to terminals, chartered vessels and warehouses as well as those with SSAT, expire at various points in time and may not be renewed/replaced with comparable assets with the specifications necessary for the Company’s or SSAT’s businesses or could be renewed/replaced on less favorable terms, if at all, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ​The Company may face unexpected dry-docking or repair costs for its vessels. ​The Company routinely engages shipyards to dry-dock its vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance.  Vessels may also have to be dry-docked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage.  Unexpected dry-dockings or repairs could require the Company to activate a reserve vessel, purchase additional fuel and operate a less-efficient, smaller vessel for a period of time.  The Company also operates a number of older active and reserve vessels that may require more frequent and extensive maintenance.  The cost of repairs is difficult to predict and can be substantial.  In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability, shipyard location, availability of employees and repairmen, and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  The timing and expense required for repairs could be exacerbated by compliance with MARAD requirements. ​The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.​The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture with SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at various U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks for the Company such as:​●The Company’s lack of voting control over the joint venture, including the risk that the joint venture takes actions resulting in reputational harm to the Company;●Misalignment or inconsistency of interests between the Company and the joint venture partner;●Reliance on the joint venture partner to fund its share of capital or fulfill its other commitments, including the risk that the joint venture partner could become bankrupt; and●Operating difficulties and financial losses at the joint venture, which may lead to the Company writing down assets or incurring impairment charges.​In addition, the Company relies on SSAT for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided or to the costs of such services provided by SSAT.  Furthermore, the Company’s results of operations have been and may continue to be impacted by lower contributions from SSAT, including as a result of declines in detention and demurrage revenue and lift volumes due to reduced carrier volumes into U.S. West Coast ports.​The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets.​Matson’s China, Alaska export, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:​●Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and developing relationships with foreign companies, business associates and governments, including as a result of cultural differences;●Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including dynamic employment and immigration laws;19Table of Contents●The Company’s ability to comply with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;●Not having continued access to existing port facilities or feeder vessels;●The Company’s ability to manage changes in the cost of goods or currency exchange rate fluctuations;●Geopolitical and economic instability;●Economic downturns or slower growth in the local markets or geographic areas in which we conduct business; ●Dynamics involving U.S. trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of or uncertainty associated with the level of tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers or sanctions, including the use of export control restrictions and sanctions against certain countries and individual companies, or other governmental actions, and responsive actions taken by the Company’s customers, including with respect to their supply chains; and●Customer preferences to diversify supply chains away from, or otherwise limit sourcing from, certain countries.​The Company’s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization. ​The Company has completed the first phase of renovating and modernizing its Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor.  However, significant upgrades remain, including projects to improve resiliency, including to risks due to severe weather events, natural disasters, sea level rise and climate-change related risks.  The Company is continuing discussions with state and local authorities regarding a port modernization program for the Port of Alaska.  Significant upgrades to the terminal and port facilities at the Port of Alaska are needed to improve operational safety and efficiency, accommodate modern shipping operations, and improve resiliency, including to risks due to severe weather events, natural disasters and climate-change related risks.  For example, the aging docks of the port are increasingly exposed to the risk of failure due to corrosion and the loss of load-bearing capacity particularly in the event of extreme seismic events or other natural disasters.  Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the expansion and modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business plans, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the terminal modernization programs may not result in improved operational productivity or improved resiliency to severe weather events, extreme seismic events or other natural disasters or generate expected returns. ​Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability.​War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company.  Wars or terrorism could impact global supply chains due to changes in vessel routing, product sourcing decisions, or governmental sanctions or restrictions.  Additionally, acts of war and future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may also be directed at the Company’s shipping operations or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operations.  Heightened security measures, including customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination, potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways.​Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. ​The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions, including, for example, the Company’s acquisitions of Horizon Lines, Inc. (“Horizon”) in 2015 and Span Alaska in 2016.  There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions.  Even if suitable candidates are identified, such transactions may result in regulatory scrutiny, litigation and difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired.​20Table of ContentsRisks Related to Employees​Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by the Company’s unionized workers and other workers or their unions in related industries could adversely affect the Company’s operations.​A significant portion of Matson’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third parties, including SSAT, which employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.  For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Part I, Item 1, Subheading C. Employees and Labor Relations of this Annual Report.​Previously, the Company has been adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management of the Company or other companies to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices.  In the past, strikes, slow-downs and disruptions have occurred as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.​In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits on the availability of labor through trade union hiring halls, have had and in the future, particularly in years when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, could have an adverse impact on Matson’s or SSAT’s operations.​Loss of the Company’s key personnel or failure to adequately manage human capital could adversely affect its business.​The Company’s future success depends, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel and skilled employees, including its senior management, as well as key personnel at its joint venture partners.  The permanent or temporary loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s future operating results because of such employees’ experience with and knowledge of the Company’s business and customer relationships.  If key personnel and skilled employees depart or are unable or unwilling to work, the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired to the extent it cannot replace such personnel or sufficiently train new personnel in a timely manner.  In addition, the Company may incur significant costs to replace these employees.  Whether the Company can meet its labor needs is subject to a variety of pressures, including market compensation and benefit levels, which may be impacted by pressure within the industry to increase wages, including due to the threat of a labor strike; the availability of labor, which may be impacted by national and global labor trends including higher-than-normal levels of individuals leaving the workforce and industry trends including aging workforces that may reduce the available pool of skilled workers; a mismatch of skills or experience to support the evolving needs of the Company’s business; and employee expectations or desire for changes in the work environment.  In addition, the Company’s workforce is aging, and within the next few years an increasing number of employees will be eligible to retire, which may result in a period of higher turnover rates than we have historically experienced and could amplify these challenges.  The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.​The Company’s investments in and efforts to manage its human capital and maintain a desirable workplace culture, including to create a safe and healthy work environment, improve diversity and create a respectful, responsive and inclusive culture, and foster a rewarding workplace for employee development and advancement, may not be successful in identifying, attracting, developing, motivating, retaining, competing for or replacing qualified personnel.  These efforts and the Company’s reputation may also be impacted by any failure or perceived failure to meet or timely progress on publicly disclosed human capital-related goals and initiatives, including with respect to diversity, equity and inclusion, or to compare favorably with the progress or goals of its industry or peers.​Risks Related to Information Technology ​If the Company is not able to use its information technology and communications systems effectively, the Company’s ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted.​The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of its information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  The Company regularly updates its information technology systems or implements new systems, which could cause substantial business interruption.  There is no assurance that the systems upgrades or new systems will meet the Company’s current or future business needs, or that they will operate as designed.21Table of Contents​The Company’s information technology systems also rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  The Company has no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  In the past, disruptions in the Company’s third-party service providers have impacted the Company’s operations, including the Company’s ability to book and manage freight, stow vessels, and process customs declarations.  Some of the Company’s employees work from home or remotely, increasing the Company’s dependence on its information technology systems and third-party providers during those times.  If the Company’s information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if the Company’s third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions, cyber attacks or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of the Company’s information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers.​The Company’s information technology systems have in the past and may in the future be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.​The shipping industry is a more frequent target of cyber attacks than some other industries because of the essential nature of these services.  The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers in many aspects of its business, including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees.  The Company’s practices, policies and other efforts, including as described in Part I, Item 1C of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be sufficient to prevent, detect or remediate all cybersecurity risks or other disruptions, and the Company and its service providers have in the past experienced and may in the future experience cybersecurity incidents, disruptions, threats and vulnerabilities such as malware (including computer viruses and ransomware), software bugs, denial-of-service (“DoS”) attacks, phishing, spoofing, identity-based attacks, code injection attacks, cyber terrorism, sabotage, circumvention of security systems (whether physical or virtual), malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions or loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized access or other catastrophic events or failures at the Company’s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. ​Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company’s systems or those of third parties on which the Company relies could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact the Company’s ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability.​Risks Related to Financial Matters​A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.​Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facility to support its operations when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facility based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, as has been the case in connection with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2022 and 2023, which could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations.  Disruptions to the credit markets as a result of macroeconomic, geopolitical, or financial market developments could increase the Company’s cost of capital and limit the Company’s access to capital. ​22Table of ContentsFailure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.​The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, certain prohibitions on additional priority debt and the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity.  If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in a default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Company’s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.​The Company’s effective income tax rate may vary.​Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable material or immaterial effects on the Company’s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company’s net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of Capital Construction Fund (“CCF”) deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; changes to the allowable amounts of foreign derived intangible income deductions; and acquisitions and changes in the Company’s corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to the Company’s effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. ​Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.​The amount of the Company’s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses.​The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees.​The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report).  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if any of the multi-employer plans to which the Company contributes fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes on the Company and other contributing employers.​23Table of ContentsRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters​As an ocean transportation and logistics services company, the Company is subject to numerous safety, environmental, and other laws and regulations that impact the Company’s operations, are costly to comply with and expose us to liability.​The Company, including its vessels and terminals, is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to safety, cabotage, equipment standards and government rates.  In addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations; air emissions; use of shore power at California ports; wastewater discharges; management of storm water; the storage, transportation, handling, emission and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination and liability for damages to the environment; health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources; and climate change, including any regulations, mandates or restrictions related to GHG emissions, such as a potential carbon tax, and energy use.  Any changes in applicable laws and regulations, including their enforcement, interpretation or implementation that results in more stringent requirements than currently anticipated, as well as any new laws and regulations that are adopted could impose significant additional costs and limitations on the Company’s ability to operate.  Mitigation strategies or contingency plans to remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays.  Such costs may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.  For a discussion of specific laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. ​Federal, state and local laws and regulations require us to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up, among other requirements impacting the Company’s business.  In complying with applicable laws and regulations, the Company has incurred expenses and may incur material future costs and expenses related to vessel and equipment modifications, new equipment, higher-priced fuel, changes in operating practices and procedures, tracking emissions, changing routes, adopting or modifying energy sources and undergoing additional oversight inspections, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition.  For example, Matson’s vessels operate within emissions control areas, and the Company’s U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained “in class” and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies.  They also must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard.  The Company’s vessels’ operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels, but there is no assurance that the Company’s programs and policies will be sufficient to have such certificates and licenses renewed.  The EPA also requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.​These laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, sanctions, as well as criminal and civil penalties and significant environmental liabilities, in the event of any violations of, or non-compliance with, their requirements (including any waivers, permits or recordkeeping and other reporting requirements).  Any vessel-generated pollution from incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles, and in some cases, within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone, for example, could expose us to such fines or penalties.​The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company.​The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury, loss of life and property damage, environmental, shore power and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers.​24Table of ContentsThe Company may continue to be exposed to risks and unknown liabilities related to the Horizon acquisition.​The Company acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015.  The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.​Pasha acquired Horizon’s former Hawaii business immediately before the Company acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon’s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants.  In some cases, however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.  The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.​​"
15,MATX,MATSON INC,2023-02-24,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS​The following material factors, events and uncertainties may make an investment in the Company speculative or risky and should be reviewed carefully.  The Company’s business faces the material risks set forth below; however, these risk factors do not identify all risks the Company faces, and additional risks or uncertainties that are currently unknown or are not currently believed to be material may occur or become material.  The occurrence of these or the events and uncertainties described below may, in ways the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, demand, revenue, growth, prospects, reputation or stock price.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf are qualified by the risks described below.​Risks Related to the Jones Act  ​Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.​The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act) regulates all interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S.  If the Jones Act were repealed, substantially amended or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flagged and foreign-built vessels and/or being exempt from other U.S. regulations, the Company’s business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Company’s position as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels would be negatively impacted if periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act were successful.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flagged or foreign-built vessels and could have other adverse impacts to our business.  ​The Company’s business would be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.​Certain provisions of the Company’s articles of incorporation protect the Company’s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  If non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company’s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Company’s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels.​Risks Related to the Company’s Operations​Changes in macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical developments, or governmental policies, including from the COVID-19 pandemic, have affected and could in the future affect the Company. ​The transportation industry in which the Company operates has been impacted by fluctuations, volatility, downturns, inflation, recessions and other economic shifts or market instabilities, as well as the development of and changes in governmental policies and relations and geopolitical developments, across the jurisdictions in which it operates.  For example, there have been increases in geopolitical and trade tensions among a number of the world’s major economies.  These tensions have resulted in the implementation of tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and sanctions, including the use of export control restrictions and sanctions against certain countries and individual companies, which have, and may continue to have, an adverse economic impact in the markets in which the Company operates.​These adverse economic conditions may also impact customers’ business levels and needs.  Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, Alaska and Guam, which include tourism, military spending, construction, personal income growth and employment, the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, and the economy in the U.S. Mainland, inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary fears and the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies may reduce the demand for goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, pressure from U.S. or foreign governments, imposition of tariffs 14Table of Contentsand uncertainties regarding tariff rates or a change in international trade policies could adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company’s CLX and CLX+ services.​Fluctuations in the price of oil could further impact the Alaskan economy, which in turn could impact the Company’s business.  In addition, the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic and related impacts on the Company’s customers’ business operations, including financial difficulties or bankruptcies, may persist for an indefinite period, even as the pandemic subsides.​As the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, supply and demand trends normalize, and supply chain congestion eases, the high volumes and rates the Company previously experienced in its China service have declined, but the Company cannot predict the size and duration of such decline.  These declines have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce revenues, but certain fixed costs remain.  For example, the Company cannot terminate leases early for chartered vessels in the CLX+ service absent a breach by vessel owners.  ​The Company’s operations may be further impacted if its employees, including mariners aboard our vessels, are otherwise restricted from or unable to perform their duties, the Company’s or SSAT’s terminals are temporarily closed, or there are outbreaks aboard the Company’s vessels that cause the Company to miss port calls, due to a COVID-19 outbreak.  Some vessel dry-dockings could also be delayed or become more expensive if shipyards are unable to accommodate demand or obtain parts in a timely manner or if necessary personnel are not allowed to travel to the shipyards. ​As the COVID-19 pandemic reaches endemic stages, the future impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows remains difficult to predict at this time.  Additional or unforeseen effects from COVID-19, including resurgences or mutations of the virus and the actions taken in response to the virus, may give rise to additional risks or instigate or amplify the other risks described throughout these Risk Factors
.​The shipping industry is competitive, and the Company has been impacted by new or increased competition. ​The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company’s markets.  The shipping industry is competitive with limited barriers to entry, especially in international tradelanes.  Ocean carriers can shift vessels in and out of tradelanes or charter vessels to manage capacity and meet customer demands.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s volumes and rates.​The loss of or damage to key customer or agent relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business.​The Company’s businesses are dependent on their relationships with customers and agents, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company’s largest customers.  The Company’s business relies on its relationships with the U.S. military, freight forwarders and non-vessel owning common carriers, large retailers and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  For more information regarding the Company’s significant customers, see the discussion in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. ​The Company could also be adversely affected by any changes in the services, or changes to the costs of services, provided by third-party vendors such as railroads, truckers, terminals, agents and shipping companies, including charter vessel owners.  Service structures and relationships with these parties are important in the Company’s intermodal business, as well as in the China, Guam, Micronesia, Japan, Alaska export and South Pacific services.  ​The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business and revenue.​The Company is dependent upon key vendors and third parties for equipment, capacity, facilities, infrastructure and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected.​The Company’s businesses are dependent upon key vendors who provide terminal, rail, truck, and ocean transportation services.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third parties at reasonable prices or rates to meet its or its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their 15Table of Contentstransportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.  If this were to occur, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.​An increase in fuel prices, changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, and/or the cost or limited availability of required fuels on the U.S. West Coast may adversely affect the Company’s profits.  ​Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company’s Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control, including impacts from global macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses, such as energy costs and costs to purchase outside transportation services.  In the Company’s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel-related surcharges, although increases in the fuel-related surcharge may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, including recovery of all or most fuel-related expenses, also may adversely affect its results of operations.  ​Evolving stakeholder expectations related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters exposes the Company to heightened scrutiny, additional costs, operational challenges and a number of risks.  ​Investors, advisory firms, employees, customers, suppliers, governments and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on, and establishing expectations for, ESG matters and related corporate practices, disclosures and initiatives.  These evolving expectations may impact the Company’s reputation, business and attractiveness as an investment, employer or business partner to the extent the Company – including its initiatives, goals and reporting – meets or is perceived to meet those expectations, including as a result of any third-party rating or assessment.  The adoption and expansion of ESG-related legislation and regulation have also resulted and may again result in increased capital expenditures and compliance, operational and other costs to the Company.​The Company’s public disclosures on its climate, sustainability, human capital and other ESG initiatives include its goals or expectations with respect to those matters, including GHG emission reduction targets.  These disclosures are aspirational and based on standards and frameworks for presenting and measuring progress that are not harmonized and are still developing, assumptions that may change, and disclosure controls and procedures that continue to evolve.  The Company’s initiatives and goals may not be favored by certain stakeholders and could impact the attraction and retention of investors, customers and employees, as well as the Company’s willingness to do business with other companies or customers or their willingness to do business with us.  Efforts to achieve the Company’s initiatives and goals face numerous risks and may be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays, and as a result may have an adverse impact on the Company, including its brand, reputation and stock price. ​The Company may not be timely or successful in completing its fleet upgrade initiatives, which may result in significant costs and adversely impact the Company’s ability to meet its climate goals.  ​The Company’s four new Aloha and Kanaloa class vessels include dual fuel capable engines that can run on low sulfur fuel oil or LNG.  The Company has announced plans to install tanks, piping and cryogenic equipment on Daniel K. Inouye and Kaimana Hila, and re-engine Manukai to operate on LNG.  In addition, the Company has announced plans to construct three new LNG-ready Aloha Class vessels.  The Company anticipates making significant capital expenditures in connection with these fleet initiatives.  These initiatives may be hindered by substantial delays and long lead times for necessary equipment, including as a result of ongoing supply chain congestion, other residual impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, increased demand across the industry for LNG installations and conversions, and new ship-building.  Additional operating costs may be incurred to the extent additional ships are needed to maintain schedule integrity while such updates and installations are performed.  Once completed, operation of these vessels may be slowed to the extent they present new maintenance requirements or unforeseen complications.  ​Use of LNG fuel may not result in anticipated GHG emission reductions, and the Company’s investments in LNG-ready vessels, whether on their own or in addition to other Company initiatives, may be insufficient to meet the Company’s previously announced GHG emission reduction goals on a timely basis or at all.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure LNG via bunker barges or other methods on the U.S. West Coast or in China in sufficient amounts to fuel its vessels or at a reasonable cost, as increased demand for LNG could decrease available supply of LNG and 16Table of Contentsincrease prices.  Governments have in the past and may again in the future impose tariffs on LNG that also may increase supply costs.  As a result of these risks, the Company may not fully realize the benefits of these investments. ​The Company’s vessel construction agreements with Philly Shipyard subject the Company to risks.​On November 1, 2022, MatNav and Philly Shipyard entered into vessel construction agreements pursuant to which Philly Shipyard will construct three new 3,600-TEU Aloha Class dual-fuel capable containerships, with expected delivery dates during the fourth quarter of 2026 and subsequent deliveries currently expected in the second and fourth quarters of 2027.  Failure of any party to the vessel construction agreements to fulfill its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.  Such a failure could happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) delivery delays, (ii) delivery of vessels that fail to meet any of the required operating specifications (for example, capacity, fuel efficiency or speed), (iii) events in South Korea that prevent one or more significant subcontractors to Philly Shipyard from performing, (iv) loss of key personnel at either Philly Shipyard or any of its subcontractors, (v) work stoppages or other labor disruptions that may occur as a result of the failure of Philly Shipyard to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with its unions, or (vi) the insolvency of, or the refusal or inability to perform for any reason, by Philly Shipyard or any of its subcontractors.  Significant delays in the delivery of the new vessels could limit our ability to replace aging vessels in the Alaska service without substantial modifications, which could also have an adverse impact on our business plans, financial condition and results of operations.​The Company’s operations are susceptible to weather, natural disasters, maritime accidents, spill events and other physical and operating risks, including those arising from climate change.​As a maritime transportation company, the Company’s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather, natural disasters and other climate-driven events, such as rising temperatures, sea levels and storm severity, bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes, as well as a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Climate change has increased and may continue to increase the frequency, severity and uncertainty of such events.  Such events interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal operations and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes.  These impacts could be particularly acute in ports such as Dutch Harbor and Kodiak, Alaska where the Company is dependent on a single crane.  The Company’s vessels and their cargoes are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error.  ​The occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of terminals, port facilities and infrastructure, vessels, containers, cargo and other equipment, increased maintenance expense, loss of life or physical injury to its employees or people, pollution, or the slow down or suspension of operations.  These events can expose the Company to reputational harm and liability for resulting damages and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer.  Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for income-generating activity.  Furthermore, the Port of Alaska requires upgrades to its port facilities and infrastructure to improve operational safety and efficiency, accommodate modern shipping operations and improve resiliency, as well as to mitigate the risk of failure due to corrosion or loss of load-bearing capacity.  As a result, there is an increased risk that an earthquake or other natural disaster could damage or render inoperable, in whole or in part, port facilities and infrastructure at the Port of Alaska.  This, in turn, could adversely affect transportation volumes or rates in Alaska and adversely impact the Company’s Ocean Transportation business and Span Alaska’s freight forwarding business, particularly given the Alaskan economy’s dependence on this port for ocean cargo.​The Company’s casualty and liability insurance policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles and may not cover all losses the Company may incur.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally are not insured.  In some cases, the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.​17Table of ContentsThe Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change.  ​The Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change and the global shift toward a low carbon future.  Organizational, industrial and governmental shifts in operations as well as legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or eliminate emissions and/or increase efficiency may require the Company to increase expenditures, make changes to existing infrastructure, vessels and equipment and shift its business model.  For example, the maritime industry is moving toward deployment of clean energy technologies and use of electricity powered by renewable energy sources to power terminal operations as a way to reduce shoreside GHG emissions.  As the Company and SSAT increase their reliance on the power grid at terminals, including for cold-ironing and ground service fleets, the Company may experience increased risks related to power outages, brown outs or black outs.  The likelihood of these risks is compounded by uncertainties regarding the reliability of renewable energy sources as well as any increased frequency of extreme weather events that may disrupt the generation or transmission of electricity.  In addition, compliance with new climate change requirements or regulations such as the IMO’s requirements related to EEXI and CII may create schedule disruptions and could require Matson’s fleet to slow down if efficiency improvements or transitions to alternative fuels together are not enough to reduce GHG emissions sufficiently, thus impacting Matson’s expedited business model and competitive advantage.  New environmental requirements for vessel performance and operation could also require the Company to accelerate the building of new vessels, increase the construction costs for new vessels and equipment to accommodate even newer technology as it emerges while today’s technology becomes obsolete, initiate unexpected retrofit projects for existing vessels, retire older vessels earlier than expected, or render reserve vessels unusable.  If these outcomes were to occur, the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.​The Company faces risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or other major health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could significantly disrupt the Company’s business.​The Company’s business could be impacted adversely by the effects of public health epidemics, pandemics or other major heath crises (which the Company refers to collectively as public health crises).  Actual or threatened public health crises may have a number of adverse impacts, including volatility in the global economy, impacts to the Company’s customers’ business operations, reduced tourism in the markets the Company serves, potential restrictions on employee travel, or significant disruptions in ocean-borne transportation of goods, logistics demand and supply chain activity, caused by a variety of factors such as quarantines, factory and office closures, port closures, or other government-imposed restrictions, any of which could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  ​The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced on acceptable terms.​The significant operating agreements and leases entered into by the Company in its businesses, including those related to terminals, chartered vessels and warehouses as well as those with SSAT, expire at various points in time and may not be replaced with comparable assets with the specifications necessary for the Company’s or SSAT’s businesses or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ​The Company may face unexpected dry-docking or repair costs for its vessels. ​The Company routinely engage shipyards to dry-dock its vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance.  Vessels may also have to be dry-docked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage.  Unexpected dry-dockings or repairs could require the Company to activate a reserve vessel, purchase additional fuel and operate a less-efficient, smaller vessel for a period of time.  The Company also operates a number of older active and reserve vessels that may require more frequent and extensive maintenance.  The cost of repairs is difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial.  In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. ​18Table of ContentsThe Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.​The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture with SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at various U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks for the Company such as:​●The Company’s lack of voting control over the joint venture, including the risk that the joint venture takes actions resulting in reputational harm to the Company;●Misalignment or inconsistency of interests between the Company and the joint venture partner;●Reliance on the joint venture partner to fund its share of capital or fulfill its other commitments, including the risk that the joint venture partner could become bankrupt; and●Operating difficulties and financial losses at the joint venture, which may lead to the Company writing down assets or incurring impairment charges.​In addition, the Company relies on SSAT for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided or to the costs of such services provided by SSAT.  Furthermore, the Company’s results of operations have been and may continue to be impacted by lower contributions from SSAT, including as a result of declines in detention and demurrage revenue and lift volumes due to reduced carrier volumes into U.S. West Coast ports.  ​The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets.​Matson’s China, Alaska export, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:​●Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and developing relationships with foreign companies, business associates and governments, including as a result of cultural differences;●Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including dynamic employment and immigration laws;●The Company’s ability to comply with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;●Not having continued access to existing port facilities or feeder vessels;●The Company’s ability to manage changes in the cost of goods or currency exchange rate fluctuations;●Geopolitical and economic instability; ●Economic downturns or slower growth in the local markets or geographic areas in which we conduct business; and●Dynamics involving U.S. trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of or uncertainty associated with the level of tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers or sanctions, including the use of export control restrictions and sanctions against certain countries and individual companies, or other governmental actions.​The Company’s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization. ​The Company has completed the first phase of renovating and modernizing its Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor.  Significant additional upgrades and projects remain.  The Company is also continuing discussions with state and local authorities regarding a port modernization program for the Port of Alaska.  Significant upgrades to the terminal and port facilities are needed to improve operational safety and efficiency, accommodate modern shipping operations, and improve resiliency.  For example, the aging docks of the port are increasingly exposed to the risk of failure due to corrosion and the loss of load-bearing capacity particularly in the event of extreme seismic events or other natural disasters.  Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the expansion and modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business plans, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the terminal modernization programs may not result in improved operational productivity or generate expected returns. ​19Table of ContentsHeightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability. ​War, including the war in Ukraine, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company.  Wars or terrorism could impact global supply chains due to changes in vessel routing, product sourcing decisions, or governmental sanctions or restrictions.  Additionally, acts of war and future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may also be directed at the Company’s shipping operations or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures, including customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination, potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways.​Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. ​The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions, including, for example, the Company’s acquisitions of Horizon Lines, Inc. (“Horizon”) in 2015 and Span Alaska in 2016.  There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions.  Even if suitable candidates are identified, such transactions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired.​Risks Related to Employees​Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by the Company’s unionized workers and other workers or their unions in related industries could adversely affect the Company’s operations.​A significant portion of Matson’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third parties, including SSAT, which employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.  For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item 1.C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I of this Annual Report.​The Company has been adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management of the Company or other companies to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices.  In the past, strikes, slow-downs and disruptions have occurred as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.  ​Matson and SSAT are members of the PMA, which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the ILWU on the U.S. West Coast.  The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements that cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor expired on July 1, 2022.  These collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, but if such agreements are not renewed, Matson and SSAT could be subject to future slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson’s or SSAT’s operations.​In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits on the availability of labor through trade union hiring halls, have had and in the future, particularly in years when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, could have an adverse impact on Matson’s or SSAT’s operations.  ​20Table of ContentsLoss of the Company’s key personnel or failure to adequately manage human capital could adversely affect its business. ​The Company’s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel and skilled employees, including its senior management, as well as key personnel at its joint venture partners.  The permanent or temporary loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s future operating results because of such employees’ experience with and knowledge of the Company’s business and customer relationships.  If key personnel and skilled employees depart or are unable or unwilling to work, the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired to the extent it cannot replace such personnel or sufficiently train new personnel in a timely manner.  In addition, the Company may incur significant costs to replace these employees.  Whether the Company can meet its labor needs is subject to a variety of pressures, including market compensation and benefit levels, which may be impacted by pressure within the industry to increase wages, including due to the threat of a labor strike; the availability of labor, which may be impacted by national and global labor trends including higher-than-normal levels of individuals leaving the workforce and industry trends including aging workforces that may reduce the available pool of skilled workers; a mismatch of skills or experience to support the evolving needs of the Company’s business; and employee expectations or desire for changes in the work environment.  In addition, the Company’s workforce is aging, and within the next few years an increasing number of employees will be eligible to retire, which may result in a period of higher turnover rates than we have historically experienced and could amplify these challenges.  The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.  ​The Company’s investments in and efforts to manage its human capital and maintain a desirable workplace culture, including to create a safe and healthy work environment, improve diversity and create a respectful, responsive and inclusive culture, and foster a rewarding workplace for employee development and advancement, may not be successful in identifying, attracting, developing, motivating, retaining, competing for or replacing qualified personnel.  These efforts and the Company’s reputation may also be impacted by any failure or perceived failure to meet or timely progress on publicly disclosed human capital-related goals and initiatives, including with respect to diversity, equity and inclusion, or to compare favorably with the progress or goals of its industry or peers.  ​Risks Related to Information Technology ​If the Company is not able to use its information technology and communications systems effectively, the Company’s ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted. ​The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of its information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  The Company regularly updates its information technology systems or implements new systems, which could cause substantial business interruption.  There is no assurance that the systems upgrades or new systems will meet the Company’s current or future business needs, or that they will operate as designed.​The Company’s information technology systems also rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  The Company has no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  In the past, disruptions in the Company’s third-party service providers have impacted the Company’s operations, including the Company’s ability to book and manage freight, stow vessels, and process customs declarations.  In the past, some of the Company’s employees worked from home or remotely, increasing the Company’s dependence on its information technology systems and third-party providers during those times.  If the Company’s information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if the Company’s third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of the Company’s information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers.  ​21Table of ContentsThe Company’s information technology systems have in the past and may in the future be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.​The shipping industry is a more frequent target of cyber attacks than some other industries because of the essential nature of these services.  The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers in many aspects of its business, including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees.  Despite the Company’s continuous efforts to make investments in the Company’s information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect the Company’s data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and the Company’s use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of the Company’s systems, the Company has in the past experienced and may in the future experience cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, ransomware, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company’s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. ​Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company’s systems or those of third parties on which the Company relies could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact the Company’s ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. ​Risks Related to Financial Matters​A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.  ​Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facility to support its operations when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facility based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, as has been the case in connection with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2022, which could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations.  Disruptions to the credit markets as a result of macroeconomic, geopolitical, or financial market developments could increase the Company’s cost of capital and limit the Company’s access to capital. ​Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.  ​The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, certain prohibitions on additional priority debt and the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity.  If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in a default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Company’s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.​22Table of ContentsThe Company’s effective income tax rate may vary.  ​Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable material or immaterial effects on the Company’s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company’s net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of Capital Construction Fund (“CCF”) deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; changes to the allowable amounts of foreign derived intangible income deductions; and acquisitions and changes in the Company’s corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to the Company’s effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. ​Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.​The amount of the Company’s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses.​The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees.​The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report).  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if any of the multi-employer plans to which the Company contributes fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes on the Company and other contributing employers.​Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters​As an ocean transportation and logistics services company, the Company is subject to numerous safety, environmental, and other laws and regulations that impact the Company’s operations, are costly to comply with and expose us to liability.  ​The Company, including its vessels and terminals, is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to safety, cabotage, equipment standards and government rates.  In addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations; air emissions; use of shore power at California ports; wastewater discharges; management of storm water; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources; and climate change, including any regulations, mandates or restrictions related to GHG emissions, such as a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, and energy use.  Any changes in applicable laws and regulations, including their enforcement, interpretation or implementation that results in more stringent requirements 23Table of Contentsthan currently anticipated, as well as any new laws and regulations that are adopted could impose significant additional costs and limitations on the Company’s ability to operate.  Mitigation strategies or contingency plans to remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays.  Such costs may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.  For a discussion of specific laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.  ​Federal, state and local laws and regulations require us to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up, among other requirements impacting the Company’s business.  In complying with applicable laws and regulations, the Company has incurred expenses and may incur material future costs and expenses related to vessel and equipment modifications, new equipment, higher-priced fuel, changes in operating practices and procedures, tracking emissions, changing routes, adopting or modifying energy sources and undergoing additional oversight inspections, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition.  For example, Matson’s vessels operate within emissions control areas, and the Company’s U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained “in class” and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies.  They also must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard.  The Company’s vessels’ operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels, but there is no assurance that the Company’s programs and policies will be sufficient to have such certificates and licenses renewed.  The EPA also requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. ​These laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, as well as criminal and civil penalties, in the event of any violations of, or non-compliance with, their requirements (including any waivers, permits or recordkeeping and other reporting requirements).  Any vessel-generated pollution from incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles, and in some cases, within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone, for example, could expose us to such fines or penalties.​The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company.​The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental, shore power and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers.  ​The Company may continue to be exposed to risks and unknown liabilities related to the Horizon acquisition.  ​The Company acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015.  The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.​Pasha acquired Horizon’s former Hawaii business immediately before the Company acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon’s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants.  In some cases, however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.  The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.​​"
4,MATX,MATSON INC,2022-02-25,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS​The following material factors, events and uncertainties may make an investment in the Company speculative or risky and should be reviewed carefully.  The Company’s business faces the material risks set forth below; however, these risk factors do not identify all risks the Company faces, and additional risks or uncertainties that are currently unknown or are not currently believed to be material may occur or become material.  The occurrence of these or the events and uncertainties described below may, in ways the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, demand, revenue, growth, prospects, reputation or stock price.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf are qualified by the risks described below.​Risks Related to the Jones Act  ​Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.​The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act) regulates all interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S.  If the Jones Act were repealed, substantially amended or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flagged and foreign-built vessels and/or being exempt from other U.S. regulations, the Company’s business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Company’s position as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels would be negatively impacted if periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act were successful.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flagged or foreign-built vessels and could have other adverse impacts to our business.  In the past, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has suggested that the Jones Act should be a topic of trade negotiations between the U.S. and the United Kingdom.​The Company’s business would be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.​Certain provisions of the Company’s articles of incorporation protect the Company’s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  If non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company’s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Company’s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels.​13Table of ContentsRisks Related to the Company’s Operations​Changes in economic conditions or governmental policies, including from the COVID-19 pandemic, have affected and could in the future affect the Company. ​The transportation industry in which the Company operates has been impacted by fluctuations, volatility, downturns, inflation, recessions and other economic shifts or market instabilities, as well as the development of and changes in governmental policies and relations, across the jurisdictions in which it operates.  These adverse economic conditions may also impact customers’ business levels and needs.  Within the United States, a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii and Alaska, which include tourism, military spending, construction, personal income growth and employment, the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, and the economy in the U.S. Mainland, inflation, and the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies may reduce the demand for goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, pressure from U.S. or foreign governments, imposition of tariffs and uncertainties regarding tariff rates or a change in international trade policies could adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company’s China service.​Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has harmed the U.S. and global economies, shut down or limited many business operations, led to port closures, and disrupted manufacturing, rail services, supply chains, travel, drayage of containers and transportation of goods for extended periods of time.  In the United States and in many other countries worldwide, public health officials and state and local governments have recommended or mandated a range of precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and its variants as they evolve and fluctuate in their global impacts.  The full impact of such disruptions on the Company’s business remains uncertain.  ​The pandemic and related uncertainties and restrictions have previously reduced tourism in the markets the Company serves, including Hawaii, Guam and Alaska, and led to increased unemployment and weakened consumer demand in certain segments, including reduced demand for freight that the Company would otherwise carry in those tradelanes.  Fluctuations in the price of oil and reduced demand from the decline in air or car travel in response to COVID-19 could further impact the Alaskan economy, which in turn could impact the Company’s business.  In addition, the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic and related impacts on the Company’s customers’ business operations, including financial difficulties or bankruptcies, may persist for an indefinite period, even after the pandemic has subsided.​In the Company’s China service, as a result of the pandemic, the Company has experienced increased demand for its expedited ocean services.  As the pandemic subsides, supply and demand trends normalize and supply chain congestion eases, the high volumes and rates the Company has experienced will eventually decline, but the Company cannot predict the timing or size of such decline.  These declines will reduce revenues, but certain fixed costs will remain.  For example, the Company cannot terminate leases early for chartered vessels in the CLX+ service.  ​The high volumes of freight from China and supply chain congestion at U.S. West Coast ports have contributed to an industry-wide shortage of containers and chassis, resulting broadly in delays, backlog, limited throughput, cancelled sailings, and service interruptions within tradelanes and supply chains, as well as long lead times for new equipment.  There have also been labor shortages at U.S. ports related to record cargo volume, the overall employment environment and wage pressures, and outbreaks of COVID-19 which has also contributed to supply chain and port congestion.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient equipment or labor, or unload vessels on a timely basis to meet customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.  ​The Company’s operations have also been impacted by the pandemic.  The Company’s employees are restricted in their ability to travel.  The Company may be further impacted if its employees, including mariners aboard our vessels, are otherwise restricted from or unable to perform their duties, or if the Company’s or SSAT’s terminals are temporarily closed due to a COVID-19 outbreak.  Some vessel dry-dockings could also be delayed or become more expensive if shipyards are unable to accommodate demand or obtain parts in a timely manner or if necessary personnel are not allowed to travel to the shipyards. ​Due to the continuing uncertainty around the duration, breadth and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences or mutations of the virus and the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the 14Table of Contentsavailability, distribution, efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines, the ultimate impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows are difficult to predict with certainty at this time.  Additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic may give rise to additional risks or instigate or amplify the other risks described throughout these Risk Factors
.​The shipping industry is competitive, and the Company has been impacted by new or increased competition. ​The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company’s markets.  The shipping industry is competitive with limited barriers to entry, especially in international tradelanes.  Ocean carriers can shift vessels in and out of tradelanes or charter vessels to manage capacity and meet customer demands.  For example, in 2020 and 2021, in response to rising demand, several new carriers entered the China tradelane in competition with the Company’s China service.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s volumes and rates.​The loss of or damage to key customer or agent relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business.​The Company’s businesses are dependent on their relationships with customers and agents, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company’s largest customers.  The Company’s business relies on its relationships with the U.S. military, freight forwarders and non-vessel owning common carriers, large retailers and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  For more information regarding the Company’s significant customers, see the discussion in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. ​The Company could also be adversely affected by any changes in the services, or changes to the costs of services, provided by third party vendors such as railroads, truckers, terminals, agents and shipping companies, including charter vessel owners.  Service structures and relationships with these parties are important in the Company’s intermodal business, as well as in the China, Guam, Micronesia, Japan, Alaska export and South Pacific services.  ​The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business and revenue.​The Company is dependent upon key vendors and third-parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected.​The Company’s businesses are dependent upon key vendors who provide terminal, rail, truck, and ocean transportation services.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third-parties at reasonable prices or rates to meet its or its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.  If this were to occur, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.​An increase in fuel prices, changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, and/or the cost or limited availability of required fuels on the U.S. West Coast may adversely affect the Company’s profits.  ​Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company’s Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses, such as energy costs and costs to purchase outside transportation services.  In the Company’s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel-related surcharges, although increases in the fuel-related surcharge may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations.  ​Effective January 1, 2020, the IMO imposed a world-wide regulation generally requiring that all ships burn compliant fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of less than or equal to 0.5 percent.  Currently, LSFO is typically priced higher than HFO due to the need for further oil refinement.  In some market instances, the prices between the two products could be inverted.  There is no guarantee that the Company’s contracts to secure LSFO or HFO on the U.S. West Coast will secure quantities in sufficient amounts and at a reasonable cost.  In addition, prolonged use of LSFO on some 15Table of ContentsMatson vessels could degrade engine performance or lead to higher maintenance costs.  The Company’s ability to recover the higher costs of IMO 2020 compliant fuel through fuel-related surcharges, the availability of LSFO, and the potential impact on vessel performance may adversely affect the Company’s operations, business and profit.  ​Evolving stakeholder expectations related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters exposes the Company to heightened scrutiny, additional costs, operational challenges and a number of risks.  ​Investors, advisory firms, employees, customers, suppliers, governments and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on, and establishing expectations for, ESG matters and related corporate practices, disclosures and initiatives.  These evolving expectations may impact the Company’s reputation, business and attractiveness as an investment, employer or business partner to the extent the Company – including its initiatives, goals and reporting – meets or is perceived to meet those expectations, including as a result of any third-party rating or assessment.  The adoption and expansion of ESG-related legislation and regulation have also resulted and may again result in increased capital expenditures and compliance, operational and other costs to the Company.​The Company’s public disclosures on its climate, sustainability, human capital and other ESG initiatives include its goals or expectations with respect to those matters, including greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission reduction targets.  These disclosures are aspirational and based on standards and frameworks for presenting and measuring progress that are not harmonized and are still developing, assumptions that may change, and disclosure controls and procedures that continue to evolve.  The Company’s initiatives and goals may not be favored by certain stakeholders and could impact the attraction and retention of investors, customers and employees, as well as the Company’s willingness to do business with other companies or customers.  Efforts to achieve the Company’s initiatives and goals face numerous risks and may be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays, and as a result may have a material negative impact on the Company, including its brand, reputation and stock price. ​The Company may not be timely or successful in completing its fleet upgrade initiatives, which may result in significant costs and adversely impact the Company’s ability to meet its climate goals.  ​The Company’s four new Aloha and Kanaloa class vessels include dual fuel capable engines that can run on LSFO or liquefied natural gas (“LNG”).  In November 2021, the Company announced plans to install tanks, piping and cryogenic equipment on Daniel K. Inouye and to re-engine Manukai to operate on LNG.  The Company also expects to begin LNG installations on Kaimana Hila, Lurline and Matsonia, and to build three new LNG-ready vessels.  In addition, the Company is in the process of building a new neighbor island flat-deck barge.  The Company anticipates making significant capital expenditures in connection with these fleet initiatives.  These initiatives may be hindered by substantial delays and long lead times for necessary equipment, including as a result of ongoing supply chain congestion, other residual impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, increased demand across the industry for LNG installations and conversions, and new ship-building.  Additional operating costs may be incurred to the extent additional ships are needed to maintain schedule integrity while such updates and installations are performed.  Once completed, operation of these vessels may be slowed to the extent they present new maintenance requirements or unforeseen complications.  ​Use of LNG fuel may not result in anticipated GHG emission reductions, and the Company’s investments in LNG-ready vessels may be insufficient to meet the Company’s previously announced GHG emission reduction goals on a timely basis or at all.  There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure LNG via bunker barges or other methods on the U.S. West Coast in sufficient amounts to fuel its vessels or at a reasonable cost, as increased demand for LNG could decrease available supply of LNG and increase prices.  Governments have in the past and may again in the future impose tariffs on LNG that also may increase supply costs.  As a result of these risks, the Company may not fully realize the benefits of these investments. ​The Company’s operations are susceptible to weather, natural disasters, maritime accidents, spill events and other physical and operating risks, including those arising from climate change.​As a maritime transportation company, the Company’s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather, natural disasters and other climate-driven events, such as rising temperatures, sea levels and storm severity, bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes, as well as a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Climate change has increased and may continue to increase the frequency, severity and uncertainty of such events.  Such events interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather 16Table of Contentsand natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal operations and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes.  These impacts could be particularly acute in certain ports in Alaska where the Company is dependent on a single crane.  The Company’s vessels and their cargoes are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error.  ​The occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of vessels, containers, cargo and other equipment, increased maintenance expense, loss of life or physical injury to its employees or people, pollution, or the slow down or suspension of operations.  These events can expose the Company to reputational harm and liability for resulting damages and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer.  Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for income-generating activity.  ​The Company’s casualty and liability insurance policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles and may not cover all losses the Company may incur.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally are not insured.  In some cases, the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.​The Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change.  ​The Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change and the global shift toward a low carbon future.  Organizational, industrial and governmental shifts in operations as well as legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or eliminate emissions and/or increase efficiency may require the Company to increase expenditures, make changes to existing infrastructure, vessels and equipment and shift its business model.  For example, the maritime industry is moving toward deployment of clean energy technologies and use of electricity powered by renewable energy sources to power terminal operations as a way to reduce shoreside greenhouse gas emissions.  As the Company and SSAT increase their reliance on the power grid at terminals, including for cold-ironing and ground service fleets, the Company may experience increased risks related to power outages, brown outs or black outs.  The likelihood of these risks is compounded by uncertainties regarding the reliability of renewable energy sources as well as any increased frequency of extreme weather events that may disrupt the generation or transmission of electricity.  In addition, compliance with new climate change requirements or regulations such as the IMO’s requirements related to EEXI and CII could require Matson’s fleet to slow down if efficiency improvements or transitions to alternative fuels together are not enough to reduce GHG emissions sufficiently, thus impacting Matson’s expedited business model and competitive advantage.  New environmental requirements for vessel performance and operation could also require the Company to accelerate the building of new vessels, increase the construction costs for new vessels and equipment to accommodate even newer technology as it emerges while today’s technology becomes obsolete, initiate unexpected retrofit projects for existing vessels, retire older vessels earlier than expected, or render reserve vessels unusable.  If these outcomes were to occur, the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.​In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company faces risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or other major health crises, which could significantly disrupt the Company’s business.​The Company’s business could be impacted adversely by the effects of public health epidemics, pandemics or other major heath crises (which the Company refers to collectively as public health crises).  Actual or threatened public health crises may have a number of adverse impacts, including volatility in the global economy, impacts to the Company’s customers’ business operations, reduced tourism in the markets the Company serves, or significant disruptions in ocean-borne transportation of goods, logistics demand and supply chain activity, caused by a variety of factors such as quarantines, factory and office closures, port closures, or other government-imposed restrictions, any of which could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  ​The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced when they expire.​The significant operating agreements and leases entered into by the Company in its businesses, including those related to terminals, chartered vessels and warehouses as well as those with SSAT, expire at various points in the future and may 17Table of Contentsnot be replaced with comparable assets with the specifications necessary for the Company’s or SSAT’s businesses or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ​The Company may face unexpected dry-docking or repair costs for its vessels. ​The Company routinely engage shipyards to dry-dock its vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance.  Vessels may also have to be dry-docked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage.  Unexpected dry-dockings or repairs could require the Company to activate a reserve vessel, purchase additional fuel and operate a less-efficient, smaller vessel for a period of time.  The Company also operates a number of older active and reserve vessels that may require more frequent and extensive maintenance.  The cost of repairs is difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial.  In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. ​The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.​The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture with SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at various U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks for the Company such as:​●The Company’s lack of voting control over the joint venture, including the risk that the joint venture takes actions resulting in reputational harm to the Company;●Misalignment or inconsistency of interests between the Company and the joint venture partner;●Reliance on the joint venture partner to fund its share of capital or fulfill its other commitments, including the risk that the joint venture partner could become bankrupt; and●Operating difficulties and financial losses at the joint venture, which may lead to the Company writing down assets or incurring impairment charges.​In addition, the Company relies on SSAT for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided or to the costs of such services provided by SSAT.​The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets.​Matson’s China, Alaska export, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:​●Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and developing relationships with foreign companies, business associates and governments, including as a result of cultural differences;●Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including dynamic employment and immigration laws;●The Company’s ability to comply with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;●Not having continued access to existing port facilities or feeder vessels;●The Company’s ability to manage changes in the cost of goods or currency exchange rate fluctuations;●Political and economic instability; and●Dynamics involving U.S. trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of or uncertainty associated with the level of tariffs or other governmental actions.​The Company’s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization. ​The Company has completed the first phase of renovating and modernizing its Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor.  Significant additional upgrades and projects remain.  The Company has also continued discussions with state and local authorities in Anchorage, Alaska regarding upgrades to those terminal and port facilities.  Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the expansion and modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact 18Table of Contentson the Company’s business plans, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the terminal modernization programs may not result in improved operational productivity or generate expected returns. ​Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability. ​War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company’s shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures, including customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination, potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways.​Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. ​The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions, including, for example, the Company’s acquisitions of Horizon Lines, Inc. (“Horizon”) in 2015 and Span Intermediate, LLC (“Span Alaska”) in 2016.  There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions.  Even if suitable candidates are identified, such transactions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired.​Risks Related to Employees​Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by the Company’s unionized workers and other workers or their unions in related industries could adversely affect the Company’s operations.​A significant portion of Matson’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties, including SSAT, which employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.  For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item 1.C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I of this Annual Report.​The Company has been adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management of the Company or other companies to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices.  Strikes, slow-downs and disruptions have occurred as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.  ​In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits on the availability of labor through trade union hiring halls, have had and in the future, particularly in years when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, could have an adverse impact on Matson’s or SSAT’s operations.  ​Loss of the Company’s key personnel or failure to adequately manage human capital could adversely affect its business. ​The Company’s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel and skilled employees, including its senior management, as well as key personnel at its joint venture partners.  The permanent or temporary loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s future operating results because of such employees’ experience with and knowledge of the Company’s business and customer relationships.  If key personnel and skilled employees depart or are unable to work, the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired to the extent it cannot replace such personnel or sufficiently train new personnel in a timely manner.  In addition, the Company may incur significant costs to replace these employees.  Whether the 19Table of ContentsCompany can meet its labor needs is subject to a variety of pressures, including market compensation and benefit levels, which may be impacted by pressure within the industry to increase wages, including due to the threat of a labor strike; the availability of labor, which may be impacted by national and global labor trends including higher-than-normal levels of individuals leaving the workforce during COVID-19 and industry trends including aging workforces that may reduce the available pool of skilled workers; a mismatch of skills or experience to support the evolving needs of the Company’s business; and employee expectations or desire for changes in the work environment.  In addition, the Company’s workforce is aging, and within the next few years an increasing number of employees will be eligible to retire, which may result in a period of higher turnover rates than we have historically experienced and could amplify these challenges.  The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.  ​The Company’s investments in and efforts to manage its human capital and maintain a desirable workplace culture, including to create a safe and healthy work environment, improve diversity and create a respectful, responsive and inclusive culture, and foster a rewarding workplace for employee development and advancement, may not be successful in identifying, attracting, developing, motivating, retaining, competing for or replacing qualified personnel.  These efforts and the Company’s reputation may also be impacted by any failure or perceived failure to meet or timely progress on publicly disclosed human capital-related goals and initiatives, including with respect to diversity, equity and inclusion, or to compare favorably with the progress or goals of its industry or peers.  In addition, the Company may be subject to federal, state or local vaccine or other COVID-19 related mandates (including as a U.S. government contractor) and enforcement of such mandates may result in reputational harm, labor disruption and increased operating costs and impact the Company’s ability to attract and retain qualified talent, among other risks.​Risks Related to Information Technology ​If the Company is not able to use its information technology and communications systems effectively, the Company’s ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted. ​The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  The Company regularly updates its information technology systems or implements new systems, which could cause substantial business interruption.  There is no assurance that the systems upgrades or new systems will meet the Company’s current or future business needs, or that they will operate as designed.  For example, the Company recently completed a multi-year process to implement a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system intended to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of its business operations.  System enhancements are on-going.​The Company’s information technology systems also rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  The Company has no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  In the past, disruptions in the Company’s third-party service providers have impacted the Company’s operations, including the Company’s ability to book and manage freight, stow vessels, and process customs declarations.  During periods where government and health officials recommended or required doing so in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the Company’s employees worked from home or remotely, increasing the Company’s dependence on its information technology systems and third-party providers during that time.  If the Company’s information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if the Company’s third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of the Company’s information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers.  ​The Company’s information technology systems have in the past and may in the future be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.​The shipping industry is a more frequent target of cyber attacks than some other industries because of the essential nature of these services.  The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers in many aspects of its business, including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees.  20Table of ContentsDespite the Company’s continuous efforts to make investments in the Company’s information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect the Company’s data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and the Company’s use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of the Company’s systems, the Company has in the past experienced and may in the future experience cybersecurity risks, such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company’s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. ​Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company’s systems or those of third-parties on which the Company relies could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact the Company’s ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. ​Risks Related to Financial Matters​The Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded intangible assets associated with the Span Alaska acquisition become impaired.​The Company recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill, customer relationships and trade name arising from the Span Alaska acquisition.  The Company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible customer relationships include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting segment’s financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows.​A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. ​Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, as may be the case in connection with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s announced plans to increase interest rates in 2022, which would adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations.  In addition, the floating rate on certain borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility is tied to LIBOR. Regulators in the United States and other countries have begun to phase out the use of LIBOR, with a complete phase out of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates currently expected by June 2023. Uncertainty regarding the transition from LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate or rates could pose funding risks for the Company and adversely affect the Company’s financing costs.  Disruptions to the credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other macroeconomic or financial market developments could increase the Company’s cost of capital and limit the Company’s access to capital. ​21Table of ContentsFailure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.  ​The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, certain prohibitions on additional priority debt, certain prohibitions on sale and leaseback transactions, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity.  If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in a default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Company’s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.​The Company’s effective income tax rate may vary.  ​Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable material or immaterial effects on the Company’s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company’s net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of Capital Construction Fund (“CCF”) deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; changes to the allowable amounts of foreign derived intangible income deductions; and acquisitions and changes in the Company’s corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to the Company’s effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. ​Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.​The amount of the Company’s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses.​The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees.​The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report).  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if any of the multi-employer plans to which the Company contributes fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes on the Company and other contributing employers.​22Table of ContentsRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters​As an ocean transportation and logistics services company, the Company is subject to numerous safety, environmental, and other laws and regulations that impact the Company’s operations, are costly to comply with and expose us to liability.  ​The Company, including its vessels and terminals, is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to safety, cabotage, equipment standards and government rates.  In addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations; air emissions; use of shore power at California ports; wastewater discharges; management of storm water; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources; and climate change, including any regulations, mandates or restrictions related to greenhouse gas emissions, such as a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, and energy use.  Any changes in applicable laws and regulations, including their enforcement, interpretation or implementation that results in more stringent requirements than currently anticipated, as well as any new laws and regulations that are adopted could impose significant additional costs and limitations on the Company’s ability to operate.  Mitigation strategies or contingency plans to remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays.  Such costs may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.  For a discussion of specific laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report.  ​Federal, state and local laws and regulations require us to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up, among other requirements impacting the Company’s business.  In complying with applicable laws and regulations, the Company has incurred expenses and may incur material future costs and expenses related to vessel and equipment modifications, new equipment, higher-priced fuel, changes in operating practices and procedures, tracking emissions, changing routes, adopting or modifying energy sources and undergoing additional oversight inspections, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition.  For example, Matson’s vessels operate within emissions control areas, and the Company’s U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained “in class” and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies.  They also must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard.  The Company’s vessels’ operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels, but there is no assurance that the Company’s programs and policies will be sufficient to have such certificates and licenses renewed.  The EPA also requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. ​These laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, as well as criminal and civil penalties, in the event of any violations of, or non-compliance with, their requirements (including any waivers, permits or recordkeeping and other reporting requirements).  Any vessel-generated pollution from incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles, and in some cases, within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone, for example, could expose us to such fines or penalties.​The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company.​The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental, shore power and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers.  ​23Table of ContentsThe Company may continue to be exposed to risks and unknown liabilities related to the Horizon acquisition.  ​The Company acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015.  The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.​Pasha acquired Horizon’s former Hawaii business immediately before the Company acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon’s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants.  In some cases, however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.  The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.​​"
6,MATX,MATSON INC,2021-02-26,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS​The following material factors, events and uncertainties may make an investment in the Company speculative or risky and should be reviewed carefully.  The Company’s business faces the material risks set forth below; however, these risk factors do not identify all risks the Company faces, and additional risks or uncertainties that are currently unknown or are not currently believed to be material may occur or become material.  The occurrence of these or the events and uncertainties described below may, in ways the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, demand, revenue, growth, prospects, reputation, or stock price.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf are qualified by the risks described below.​Risks Related to the Jones Act  ​Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.​The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act) regulates all interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S.  If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flagged and foreign-built vessels and/or being exempt from other U.S. regulations, the Company’s business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Company’s position as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels would be negatively impacted if periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act were ever successful.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the U.S.-EU Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flagged or foreign-built vessels and could have other adverse impacts.  In the past, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has suggested that the Jones Act should be a topic of trade negotiations between the U.S. and European Union.​The Company’s business would be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.​Certain provisions of the Company’s articles of incorporation protect the Company’s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  If non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company’s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Company’s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels.​12Table of ContentsRisks Related to the Company’s Operations​The Company’s results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic effects.​The COVID-19 pandemic has harmed the U.S. and global economies, shut down or limited many business operations and disrupted manufacturing, supply chains, travel, drayage of containers, and transportation of goods.  In the United States and in many other countries worldwide, public health officials and state and local governments have recommended or mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.  The full impact of such disruptions on the Company’s business remains uncertain.  ​The pandemic has severely reduced tourism and is expected to continue to limit tourism in the markets the Company serves, including Hawaii, Guam and Alaska, and has led to reduced demand for freight that the Company would otherwise carry.  In addition, the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic and related impacts on the Company’s customers’ business operations, including financial difficulties or bankruptcies, may persist for an indefinite period, even after the pandemic has subsided.​In the Company’s China service, as a result of the pandemic, the Company has experienced increased demand for its expedited ocean services; however, as the pandemic subsides and supply and demand trends normalize, it is uncertain whether the high volumes and rates the Company has seen can be maintained in the future.  In addition, the high volumes of freight from China have contributed to an industry-wide shortage of containers and chassis and congestion at U.S. West Coast ports.  There have also been labor shortages at U.S. ports related to record cargo volume and outbreaks of COVID-19.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient equipment or unload vessels on a timely basis to meet customer’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.  ​The Company’s operations have also been impacted.  The Company’s employees are also restricted in their ability to travel.  The Company may be further impacted if its employees are otherwise unable to perform their duties, including mariners aboard our vessels, or if the Company’s terminals are temporarily closed due to a COVID-19 outbreak.  Some vessel dry-dockings could also be delayed or become more expensive if shipyards are unable to accommodate demand or obtain parts or if necessary personnel are not allowed to travel to the shipyards.  ​Due to the continuing uncertainty around the duration, breadth and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential for resurgences or mutations of the virus, the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the availability, distribution, efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines, and the impact of economic stimulus measures, the ultimate impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  Additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic may give rise to additional risks or instigate or amplify the other risks described throughout these Risk Factors
.​Changes in economic conditions or governmental policies have resulted in a decrease in consumer confidence and market demand for the Company’s services and products in certain markets and have adversely affected the Company’s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows.​Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii and Alaska, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth and employment, the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, and the economy in the U.S. Mainland, and the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, have reduced the demand for goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  For example, the uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and other restrictions have severely decreased tourism, weakened consumer demand in certain segments, increased unemployment, and contributed to an economic downturn in the U.S., impacting freight volumes and revenues.  The decline in the price of oil due to the oil trade wars and reduced demand from the decline in air or car travel in response to COVID-19 will further impact the Alaska economy, which in turn could impact the Company’s business.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, imposition of tariffs and uncertainties regarding tariff rates, or a change in international trade policies could adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company’s China service.​13Table of ContentsThe shipping industry is competitive and the Company has been impacted by new or increased competition. ​The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company’s markets.  The shipping industry is competitive with limited barriers to entry as ocean carriers can shift vessels in and out of tradelanes or charter vessels to manage capacity and meet customer demands.  For example, in May 2020, the Company’s major competitor in the China service upsized its expedited service from China to the U.S. West Coast.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s volumes and rates.​The loss of or damage to key customer or agent relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business.​The Company’s businesses are dependent on their relationships with customers and agents, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company’s largest customers.  The Company’s business relies on its relationships with the U.S. military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  For more information regarding the Company’s significant customers, see the discussion in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. ​The Company could also be adversely affected by any changes in the services, or changes to the costs of services, provided by third party vendors such as railroads, terminals, agents and shipping companies, including charter vessel owners.  Service structures and relationships with these parties are important in the Company’s intermodal business, as well as in the China, Guam, Micronesia, Japan, Alaska export and South Pacific services.  ​The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business and revenue.​The Company is dependent upon key vendors and third-parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected.​The Company’s businesses are dependent upon key vendors who provide rail, truck and ocean transportation services.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third-parties at reasonable prices or rates to meet its or its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.  If this were to occur, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.​An increase in fuel prices, changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, and/or the cost or limited availability of required fuels on the U.S. West Coast may adversely affect the Company’s profits.​Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company’s Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses, such as energy costs and costs to purchase outside transportation services.  In the Company’s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel-related surcharges, although increases in the fuel-related surcharge may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations.​Effective January 1, 2020, the IMO imposed a world-wide regulation generally requiring that all ships burn compliant fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of less than or equal to 0.5 percent.  Currently, LSFO is typically priced higher than HSFO due to the need for further oil refinement.  In some market instances, the prices between the two products could be inverted.  There is no guarantee that the Company’s contracts to secure LSFO on the U.S. West Coast will secure quantities in sufficient amounts and at a reasonable cost.  In addition, prolonged use of LSFO on some Matson vessels could degrade engine performance or lead to higher maintenance costs.  There may also be delays or other unexpected complications in connection with Matson’s announced plans to install a scrubber on at least one additional vessel.  The Company’s ability to recover the higher costs of IMO 2020 compliant fuel through fuel-related surcharges, the availability of LSFO, and the potential impact on vessel performance may adversely affect the Company’s operations, business and profit.  14Table of Contents​The Company’s operations are susceptible to weather, natural disasters, maritime accidents, spill events and other operating risks.​The Company’s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather, natural disasters and other climate-driven events, such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes, as well as a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Climate change has increased and may continue to increase the frequency, severity and uncertainty of such events.  Such events interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal operations and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes.  These impacts could be particularly acute in certain ports in Alaska where the Company is dependent on a single crane.  The Company’s vessels and their cargoes are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error.  ​The occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of vessels, containers, cargo and other equipment, loss of life or physical injury to its employees or people, pollution and suspension of operations.  These events can expose the Company to reputational harm and liability for resulting damages and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer.  Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for income-generating activity.  ​The Company’s casualty and liability insurance policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles and may not cover all losses the Company may incur.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally, are not insured.  In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.​In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company faces risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or other major health crises, which could significantly disrupt the Company’s business.​The Company’s business could be impacted adversely by the effects of public health epidemics, pandemics or other major heath crises (which the Company refers to collectively as public health crises).  Actual or threatened public health crises may have a number of adverse impacts, including volatility in the global economy, impacts to the Company’s customers’ business operations, reduced tourism in the markets the Company serves, or significant disruptions in ocean-borne transportation of goods, logistics demand and supply chain activity, caused by a variety of factors such as quarantines, factory and office closures, port closures, or other government-imposed restrictions, any of which could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  ​The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced when they expire.  ​The significant operating agreements and leases entered into by the Company in its businesses, including those related to terminals, chartered vessels and warehouses as well as those with SSAT, expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  For example, on November 26, 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into agreements whereby Maunalei, a U.S. flagged and Jones Act qualified vessel, was sold for $106.0 million and leased back from the buyer under an operating lease agreement.  The customary representations, warranties and covenants contained in the agreements do not eliminate the risks that (a) the lessor could lose its Jones Act status, (b) the Company could not replace Maunalei in the event it is no longer Jones Act eligible, or (c) if the repurchase option is elected, the Company would not be able to consummate the repurchase of Maunalei at the end of the lease term.​The Company may face unexpected dry-docking or repair costs for its vessels. ​The Company routinely engage shipyards to dry-dock its vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance.  Vessels may also have to be dry-docked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage.  Unexpected dry-dockings or repairs could require the Company to activate a reserve vessel, purchase additional fuel and operate a less-efficient, smaller vessel for a period of time.  The Company also operates a number of 15Table of Contentsolder active and reserve vessels that may require more frequent and extensive maintenance.  The cost of repairs are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial.  In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. ​The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.​The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture with SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at various U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks for the Company such as:​●The Company’s lack of voting control over the joint venture, including the risk that the joint venture takes actions resulting in reputational harm to the Company;●Misalignment or inconsistency of interests between the Company and the joint venture partner;●Reliance on the joint venture partner to fund its share of capital or fulfill its other commitments, including the risk that the joint venture partner could become bankrupt; and●Operating difficulties and financial losses at the joint venture, which may lead to the Company writing down assets or incurring impairment charges.​In addition, the Company relies on SSAT for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or to the costs of such services provided by SSAT.​The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets.​Matson’s China, Alaska export, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:​●Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and developing relationships with foreign companies, business associates and governments, including as a result of cultural differences;●Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including dynamic employment and immigration laws;●The Company’s ability to comply with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;●Not having continued access to existing port facilities or feeder vessels;●The Company’s ability to manage changes in the cost of goods or currency exchange rate fluctuations;●Political and economic instability; and●Dynamics involving U.S. trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of or uncertainty associated with the level of tariffs or other governmental actions.​The Company’s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization.​The Company has completed the first phase of renovating and modernizing its Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor.  Significant additional upgrades and projects remain.  The Company has also begun discussions with state and local authorities in Anchorage, Alaska regarding upgrades to those terminal and port facilities.  Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the expansion and modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business plans, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the terminal modernization programs may not result in improved operational productivity or generate expected returns. ​16Table of ContentsHeightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability. ​War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company’s shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures, including customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination, potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways.​Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. ​The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions, including, for example, the Company’s acquisitions of Horizon Lines, Inc. (“Horizon”) in 2015 and Span Intermediate, LLC (“Span Alaska”) in 2016.  There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions.  Even if suitable candidates are identified, such transactions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired.​Risks Related to Employees​Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by the Company’s unionized workers and other workers or their unions in related industries could adversely affect the Company’s operations.​A significant portion of Matson’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties, including SSAT, that employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.  For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item 1.C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I of this Annual Report.​The Company has been adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management of the Company or other companies to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices.  Strikes and disruptions have occurred as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.  ​In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits on the availability of labor through trade union hiring halls have had and in the future could have an adverse impact on Matson’s or SSAT’s operations.  ​Loss of the Company’s key personnel or failure to adequately manage human capital could adversely affect its business. ​The Company’s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel and skilled employees, including its senior management, as well as key personnel at its joint venture partners.  The permanent or temporary loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s future operating results because of such employees’ experience and knowledge of the Company’s business and customer relationships.  If key employees depart or are unable to work, the Company may incur significant costs to replace them.  Additionally, the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace such personnel in a timely manner.  The Company’s investments in and efforts to manage its human capital, including to maintain a desirable workplace culture, may not be successful in identifying, attracting, developing, motivating, retaining, competing for or replacing qualified personnel. The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.  ​17Table of ContentsRisks Related to Information Technology ​If the Company is not able to use the Company’s information technology and communications systems effectively, the Company’s ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted. ​The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  The Company regularly updates its information technology systems or implements new systems, which could cause substantial business interruption.  There is no assurance that the systems upgrades or new systems will meet our current or future business needs, or that they will operate as designed.  For example, the Company is in the midst of a multi-year process to implement a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system intended to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of its business operations.  ​The Company’s information technology systems also rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  The Company has no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  In the past, disruptions in the Company’s third-party service providers have impacted the Company’s operations, including the Company’s ability to book and manage freight, stow vessels, and process customs declarations.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in compliance with guidance from public health officials and state and local governments, many of the Company’s employees are working from home or remotely, increasing the Company’s dependence on its information technology systems and third-party providers.  If the Company’s information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if the Company’s third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of the Company’s information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers.  ​The Company’s information technology systems have in the past and may in the future be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.​The shipping industry is a more frequent target of cyber attacks than some other industries because of the essential nature of these services.  The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers in many aspects of its business, including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees.  Despite the Company’s continuous efforts to make investments in the Company’s information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect the Company’s data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and the Company’s use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of the Company’s systems, the Company has in the past experienced and may in the future experience cybersecurity risks, such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company’s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. ​Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company’s systems or those of third-parties on which the Company relies could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact the Company’s ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. ​Risks Related to Financial Matters​The Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded intangible assets associated with the Span Alaska acquisition become impaired.​The Company recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill, customer relationships and trade name arising from the Span Alaska acquisition.  The Company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less 18Table of Contentsthan its carrying amount.  Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible customer relationships include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting unit’s financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows.​A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. ​Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, as was the case in connection with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2018, which would adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations.  In addition, as the floating rate on certain borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility is tied to LIBOR, the uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as well as the transition from LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate or rates could pose funding risks for the Company and adversely affect the Company’s financing costs.  Disruptions to the credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other macroeconomic or financial market developments could increase the Company’s cost of capital and limit the Company’s access to capital. ​Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.  ​The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, certain prohibitions on additional priority debt, certain prohibitions on sale leaseback transactions, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity.  If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in a default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Company’s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.​The Company’s effective income tax rate may vary.  ​Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable material or immaterial effects on the Company’s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company’s net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of Capital Construction Fund (“CCF”) deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; and acquisitions and changes in the Company’s corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to the Company’s effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. ​Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.​The amount of the Company’s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may 19Table of Contentsadversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses.​The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees.​The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report).  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if any of the multi-employer plans to which the Company contributes fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes on the Company and other contributing employers.​Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters​As an ocean transportation and logistics services company, the Company is subject to numerous safety, environmental, and other laws and regulations that  impact the Company’s operations, are costly to comply with and expose us to liability.  ​The Company, including its vessels and terminals, is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to safety, cabotage, equipment standards and government rates.  In addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations; air emissions; wastewater discharges; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources; and climate change, including any regulations, mandates or restrictions related to greenhouse gas emissions, such as a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, and energy use.  For a discussion of specific laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report.  Any changes in applicable laws and regulations, including their enforcement or interpretation, as well as any new laws and regulations that are adopted, including as a result of the recent change in U.S. Presidential Administration, could impose significant additional costs and limitations on the Company’s ability to operate.  Such costs may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.​These laws and regulations require us to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up, among other requirements impacting the Company’s business.  In complying with applicable laws and regulations, the Company has incurred expenses and may incur material future costs and expenses related to vessel and equipment modifications, new equipment, higher-priced fuel, changes in operating practices and procedures, tracking emissions, changing routes, installing scrubbers, adopting or modifying energy sources and undergoing additional oversight inspections, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition.  For example, Matson’s vessels operate within emissions control areas, and the Company’s U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained “in class” and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies.  They also must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard.  The Company’s vessels’ operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels, but there is no assurance that the Company’s programs and policies will be sufficient to have such certificates and licenses renewed.  The EPA also requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. ​20Table of ContentsThese laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, as well as criminal and civil penalties, in the event of any violations of, or non-compliance with, their requirements (including any waivers, permits or recordkeeping and other reporting requirements).  Any vessel-generated pollution from incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles, and in some cases, within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone, for example, could expose us to such fines or penalties.​The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company.​The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers.​The Company may continue to be exposed to risks and unknown liabilities related to the Horizon acquisition. ​The Company acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015.  The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.​Pasha acquired Horizon’s former Hawaii business immediately before the Company acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon’s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants.  In some cases, however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.  The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.​​"
7,MATX,MATSON INC,2020-02-28,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS​The Company’s business faces the risks set forth below, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf are qualified by the risks described below.​10​Table of ContentsRisks Related to the Jones Act  ​Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.​If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels, the Company’s business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Company’s advantage as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels would be eroded if periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act were ever successful.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the U.S.-EU Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels or would have other adverse impacts.​The Company’s business would be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.​Certain provisions of the Company’s articles of incorporation protect the Company’s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Although the Company is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, if non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company’s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Company’s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, which would have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operation.​Risks Related To Operations​Changes in U.S., global, regional economic conditions or governmental policies that result in a decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Company’s services and products in Hawaii and Alaska, the U.S. Mainland, Guam, Asia or the South Pacific may adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows.​A weakening of domestic or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and freight rates.  Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii and Alaska, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth and employment, or the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, the economy in the U.S. Mainland, or the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Asia, Hawaii and Alaska, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, imposition of tariffs and uncertainty of tariff rates, or a change in international trade policies may adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company’s China service.​The Company may face new or increased competition.​The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company’s markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on our volumes and rates.  For example, in December 2016, the Company’s major competitor in the Guam service upgraded its U.S. flagged feeder containership from a bi-weekly service to a weekly service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan via transshipments over Yokohama, Japan.  As a result of this and other potential competitor actions, the Company could experience a reduction in profitability.​11​Table of ContentsThe loss of or damage to key customer or agent relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business.​The Company’s businesses are dependent on their relationships with customers and agents, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company’s largest customers.  The Company’s business relies on its relationships with the U.S. military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  In 2019, the Company’s Ocean Transportation segment’s 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of the business’ revenue.  In 2019, the Company’s Logistics segment’s 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 21 percent of the business’ revenue.​The Company could also be adversely affected by any changes in the services, or changes to the costs of services, provided by agents.  Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Company’s intermodal business as well as in the Guam, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services.  ​The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business and revenue.​The Company is dependent upon key vendors and third-parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected.​The Company’s businesses are dependent upon key vendors who provide rail, truck and ocean transportation services.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third-parties at reasonable prices or rates to meet its or its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.  If this were to occur, the Company’s business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.​An increase in fuel prices, changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, and/or the cost or limited availability of required fuels on the U.S. West Coast may adversely affect the Company’s profits.​Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company’s Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses such as energy costs and costs to purchase outside transportation services.  In the Company’s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel-related surcharges, although increases in the fuel-related surcharge may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations.​Effective January 1, 2020, the IMO has imposed a world-wide regulation that generally requires that all ships must burn compliant fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of ≤0.5 percent.  Currently, LSFO is priced significantly higher than HSFO due to the need to refine the oil and the lack of sufficient quantities of LSFO on a global basis.  While the Company has entered into contracts to secure LSFO on the U.S. West Coast, there is no guarantee that sufficient quantities will be available at a reasonable cost.  In addition, prolonged use of LSFO on some Matson vessels could degrade engine performance or lead to higher maintenance costs.  While Matson has announced plans to install scrubbers on additional vessels, there may be delays or other unexpected complications.  The Company’s ability to recover the higher costs of IMO 2020 compliant fuel through fuel-related surcharges, the availability of LSFO, and the potential impact on vessel performance and maintenance costs may adversely affect the Company’s operations, business and profit.  ​Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by unionized workers of the Company, other workers or their unions in related industries may adversely affect the Company’s operations.​As of December 31, 2019, Matson and its subsidiaries had 1,988 employees, of which 794 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with shoreside unions.  In addition, Matson’s fleet of active vessels require 298 billets to operate these vessels.  Matson’s vessel management services also employed personnel in 28 billets to manage three vessels.  Such employees are also subject to collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties including SSAT that employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.  For 12​Table of Contentsadditional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item1. C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I above.​The Company could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management of the Company or other companies to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices.  Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully. ​In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits to availability of labor through trade union hiring halls could have an adverse impact on Matson’s or SSAT’s operations.​The Company is susceptible to weather, natural disasters and other operating risks.​The Company’s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather, natural disasters and other climate driven events, such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes.  Such events will interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.  These impacts could be particularly acute in certain ports in Alaska where the Company is dependent on a single crane.​The Company’s vessels and their cargoes are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error.  The occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of vessels or other property, or injury or death of people.  If any of these events were to occur, the Company could be exposed to reputational harm and liability for resulting damages and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer.  Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for income-generating activity.  ​The Company maintains casualty and liability insurance policies, which are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally, are not insured.  In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.​We face risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or other major health crises, which could significantly disrupt our business.​Our business could be impacted adversely by the effects of public health epidemics, pandemics or other major heath crises (which we refer to collectively as public health crises).  Actual or threatened public health crises may have a number of adverse impacts, including volatility in the global economy, impacts to our customers’ business operations, reduced tourism in the markets we serve, or significant disruptions in ocean-borne transportation of goods, logistics demand and supply chain activity, caused by a variety of factors such as quarantines, factory and office closures, port closures, or other government-imposed restrictions, any of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  ​For example, on January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.  On January 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of State raised their travel advisory for mainland China from Level 3 (reconsider travel) to Level 4 (do not travel).  The outbreak of COVID-19 has harmed the Chinese economy, shut down business operations in China and disrupted manufacturing, travel, drayage of containers, and transportation of goods within and from China.  A reduction or delay in container volume from China resulting from decreased manufacturing activity, lower transportation demand or service disruptions from restrictions related to COVID-19 could adversely affect volumes or rates in our CLX service, Matson Logistics’ business related to China, and/or SSAT lift volume at its U.S. West Coast terminals.  Our operations in China may also be impacted adversely if our employees’ ability to travel to or within China is restricted or they are otherwise unable to perform their duties.  Spread of COVID-19 may reduce tourism to Hawaii, Alaska and/or Guam and thereby lead to reduced demand for 13​Table of Contentsfreight that we would otherwise carry.  In addition, vessel drydockings and scrubber installations could also be delayed or become more expensive if Chinese shipyards are unable to accommodate demand.  The continued spread of COVID-19 or the occurrence of other public health crises may adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.​The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced when they expire.  ​The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  For example, on November 26, 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into agreements whereby Maunalei, a U.S. flagged and Jones Act qualified vessel, was sold for $106.0 million and leased back from the buyer under an operating lease agreement.  While the agreements contain customary representations, warranties and covenants, there remain risks that (a) the lessor could lose its Jones Act status, (b) that the Company could not replace Maunalei in the event it is no longer Jones Act eligible, or (c) if the repurchase option is elected, that the Company would not be able to consummate the repurchase of Maunalei at the end of the lease term.​The Company may face unexpected dry-docking or repair costs for its vessels.​We routinely engage shipyards to dry-dock our vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance.  Vessels may also have to be dry-docked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage.  We also operate a number of older active and reserve vessels that may require more frequent and extensive maintenance.  The cost of repairs are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial.  Large dry-docking and other repair expenses could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​If we are not able to use our information technology and communications systems effectively, our ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted.​The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  We regularly update our information technology systems or implement new systems which could cause substantial business interruption.  There is no assurance that the systems upgrades or new systems will meet our current or future business needs, or that they will operate as designed.  Our information technology systems also rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  We have no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  If our information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if our third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of our information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers that could have an adverse effect on our business. ​Our information technology systems have in the past and may in the future be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.​The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees.  Despite our continuous efforts to make investments in our information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect our data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and our use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of our systems, we have in the past experienced and may in the 14​Table of Contentsfuture experience cybersecurity risks such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company’s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. ​Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company’s or third-party systems could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact our ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability.​Loss of the Company’s key personnel could adversely affect its business.​The Company’s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees.  The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s future operating results because of such employees’ experience and knowledge of the Company’s business and customer relationships.  If key employees depart, the Company may incur significant costs to replace them.  Additionally, the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner.  The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.​The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.​The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture, SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks such as:​●The Company may not have voting control over the joint venture;●The Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its joint venture partner;●A joint venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Company’s;●A joint venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company;●The joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture and the Company;●The joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel;●A joint venture partner could become bankrupt requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture; and●Actions of the joint venture may result in reputational harm to the Company.​In addition, the Company relies on SSAT for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California, and Seattle and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or to the costs of such services provided by SSAT.​The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets.​Matson’s China, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:​●Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies;●Challenges in working with and maintaining good relationships with business associates in our foreign operations;●Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;●Our ability to be in compliance with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials;●Global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates;●Not having continued access to existing port facilities;15​Table of Contents●Competition with established and new carriers;●Changes in vessel deployment by competitors that impact the Company’s services;●Currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations;●Political and economic instability;●Dynamics involving U.S. trade relations with other countries, including measures such as the imposition of tariffs at varying levels or other governmental actions, all of which may affect the Company’s operations; and●Challenges caused by cultural differences.​Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s operating results.​The Company is subject to risks related to an accident or spill event.​The Company’s vessel and terminal operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations.  As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.​The Company’s Shipbuilding Agreement with NASSCO is subject to risks.​On August 25, 2016, MatNav and NASSCO entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which NASSCO will construct two new 3,500-TEU sized Kanaloa Class dual-fuel capable container and roll-on/roll-off vessels.  The first vessel, Lurline, was delivered on December 26, 2019.  The second vessel, Matsonia, is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2020.  Failure of any party to the shipbuilding agreement to fulfill its obligations under the agreement could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.  Such a failure could happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) delivery delays, (ii) delivery of vessels that fail to meet any of the required operating specifications (for example, capacity, fuel efficiency or speed), (iii) events which prevent one or more significant subcontractors from performing, or (iv) the refusal or inability of NASSCO or any of its subcontractors to perform for any reason.  ​The Company’s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization.​We are investing approximately $60 million, including the installation of three new gantry cranes and upgrade of three existing cranes, as part of the first phase of a broader project to expand and improve the Company’s Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor.  We have also begun discussions with state and local authorities in Anchorage, Alaska regarding upgrades to those terminal and port facilities.  Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the expansion and modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact on our business plans, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the terminal modernization programs may not result in improved operational productivity or generate expected returns.​Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability.​War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company’s shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.​Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.​The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions, including, for example, the Company’s acquisitions of Horizon Lines, Inc. (“Horizon”) in 2015 and Span Alaska in 2016.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general 16​Table of Contentsoperating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.​The Horizon and Span Alaska acquisitions may expose us to unknown liabilities.​We acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015.  Similarly, in August 2016, we acquired Span Alaska subject to all of its liabilities and obligations.  The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.​We may continue to be exposed to risks and liabilities related to Horizon’s former Hawaii business.​Pasha acquired Horizon’s former Hawaii business immediately before we acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon’s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants.  In some cases, however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.  The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.​We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded intangible assets associated with the Horizon and Span Alaska acquisitions become impaired.​We recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill, customer relationships and trade name arising from the Horizon and Span Alaska acquisitions.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible customer relationships include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting unit’s financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows.​Risks Related to Financial Matters​A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. ​Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, as was the case in connection with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2018, which would adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations.  In addition, as the floating rate on certain borrowings under our revolving credit facility is tied to LIBOR, the uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as well as the transition from LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate or rates could pose funding risks for the Company and adversely affect the Company’s financing costs.  ​17​Table of ContentsFailure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.  ​The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, the maintenance of no more than a maximum amount of priority debt as a percentage of consolidated tangible assets, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity.  If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders resulting in a default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Company’s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.​The Company’s effective income tax rate may vary.  ​Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable material or immaterial effects on the Company’s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company’s net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of Capital Construction Fund (“CCF”) deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; and acquisitions and changes in the Company’s corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations.​Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.​The amount of the Company’s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses.​The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees.​The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below).  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if a multi-employer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes.​18​Table of ContentsRisks Related to Legal and Legislative Matters​Compliance with safety and environmental protection and other governmental requirements may adversely affect our operations.  ​The shipping industry in general, our business and the operation of our vessels and terminals in particular are affected by extensive and changing safety, environmental protection and other international, national, State and local governmental laws and regulations, including the following:  laws pertaining to air emissions; wastewater discharges; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; and health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources.  For example, our U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained “in class” and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies, and must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard.  We are subject to IMO regulations, including the new IMO 2020 regulations limiting the sulfur content of fuel oil.  Federal environmental laws and certain State laws also require us, as a vessel operator, to comply with numerous environmental regulations and to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up.  ​In complying with these laws, we have incurred expenses and may incur future expenses for vessel modifications, changes in operating procedures and undergoing additional oversight inspections.  Changes in enforcement policies for existing requirements and additional laws and regulations adopted in the future could limit our ability to do business or further increase the cost of our doing business.  Our vessels’ operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels.  However, there can be no assurance that such certificates and licenses will be renewed, even though Matson maintains extensive programs and policies to ensure such renewal.  Also, in the future, we may have to alter existing equipment, add new equipment, or change operating procedures for our vessels to comply with changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards to meet our customers’ changing needs.  If any such costs are material, they could adversely affect our financial condition.​We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental laws that could result in substantial fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.​The U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from vessels, which implements the International Maritime Pollution (MARPOL) treaty, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, among many other laws, treaties and regulations, provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to vessel-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles and in some cases within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone.  The EPA requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.  Matson’s vessels operate within emission control areas.  If our vessels are not operated in accordance with these requirements, including waivers, permits or recordkeeping and other reporting requirements, such violations could result in substantial fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business.​The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company.​The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows and financial condition.​19​Table of ContentsNon-compliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Company’s business.​The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including cabotage laws, government rate regulations, and environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act.  Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Company’s business.  Non-compliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Company’s business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses such as a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.  Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company.​​"
9,MATX,MATSON INC,2019-03-04,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The Company’s business faces the risks set forth below, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf are qualified by the risks described below. Risks Relating To Operations Changes in U.S., global, regional economic conditions or governmental policies that result in a decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Company’s services and products in Hawaii and Alaska, the U.S. Mainland, Guam, Asia or the South Pacific may adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows. A weakening of domestic or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and freight rates.  Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii and Alaska, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth and employment, or the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, the economy in the U.S. Mainland, or the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Asia, Hawaii and Alaska, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, imposition of tariffs, or a change in international trade policies may adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company’s China service. The Company may face new or increased competition. The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company’s markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the  11			 		 Table of ContentsCompany’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes and rates.  For example, in December 2016, the Company’s major competitor in the Guam service upgraded its U.S. flagged feeder containership from a bi‑weekly service to a weekly service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan via transshipments over Yokohama, Japan and Busan, South Korea.  As a result of this and other potential competitor actions, the Company could experience a reduction in profitability. The loss of or damage to key agent or customer relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s businesses are dependent on their relationships with agents and customers, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company’s largest customers.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or changes to the costs of services provided by agents.  Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Company’s intermodal business as well as in the Guam, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services.   The Company’s business also relies on its relationships with the military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  In 2018, the Company’s Ocean Transportation segment’s 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24 percent of the business’ revenue.  In 2018, the Company’s Logistics segment’s 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of the business’ revenue.  The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business and revenue. The Company is dependent upon key vendors and third-parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected. The Company’s businesses are dependent upon key vendors who provide rail, truck and ocean transportation services.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third-parties at reasonable prices or rates to meet its or its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.  If this were to occur, the Company’s business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. An increase in fuel prices, changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges, and/or the cost or limited availability of required fuels on the U.S. West Coast may adversely affect the Company’s profits. Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company’s Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses such as energy costs and costs to purchase outside transportation services.  In the Company’s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel related surcharges, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations. Effective January 1, 2020, the IMO has imposed a world-wide regulation that all ships must burn compliant fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of ≤0.5 percent.  While 0.1 percent low-sulfur distillate fuel is currently available, supplies of low-sulfur residual fuel may be limited.  Distillate and residual compliant fuels are more costly compared to scrubber technology and prolonged use on some Matson vessels could degrade engine performance or lead to higher maintenance costs.  Matson successfully operates scrubbers in the Alaska service and has announced plans to install scrubbers on three additional vessels that operate in the CLX service.  Scrubbers allow vessels to continue to burn high sulfur fuel oil and comply with IMO 2020 regulations.  Matson’s new Aloha and Kanaloa class vessel engines can burn fuel compliant with IMO 2020 regulations, including liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) although they are not currently outfitted for LNG.  The LNG infrastructure is lacking in major U.S. West Coast ports and it is unclear when this infrastructure may be constructed and operational.  The Company’s ability to recover the higher costs of IMO 2020 compliant fuel through fuel surcharges, the availability of compliant low-sulfur residual fuel, and the potential impact on vessel performance and maintenance costs may adversely affect the Company’s operations, business and profit.  12			 		 Table of ContentsWork stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by unionized workers of the Company, other workers or their unions in related industries may adversely affect the Company’s operations. As of December 31, 2018, Matson and its subsidiaries had 2,007 regular employees, of which 786 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions.  In addition, at December 31, 2018, the active Matson fleet employed seagoing personnel in 339 billets, and vessel management services employed personnel in 28 billets.  Such employees are also subject to collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties including SSAT that employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.  For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item1. C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I above. The Company could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices.  Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.  In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits to availability of labor through trade union hiring halts could have an adverse impact on Matson’s or SSAT’s operations. The Company is susceptible to weather, natural disasters and other operating risks. The Company’s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters, such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes.  Such events will interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s vessels and their cargoes are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error.  The occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of vessels or other property, or injury or death of people.  If any of these events were to occur, the Company could be exposed to reputational harm and liability for resulting damages and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer.  Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for income-generating activity.   The Company maintains casualty and liability insurance policies, which are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally, are not insured.  In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance. The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.   The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  For example, on November 26, 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into agreements whereby MV Maunalei, a U.S. flagged and Jones Act qualified vessel, was sold for $106.0 million and leased back from the buyer under an operating lease agreement.  While the agreements contain customary representations, warranties and covenants, there remain risks that the lessor could lose its Jones Act status, that the Company could not replace MV Maunalei in the event it is no longer Jones Act eligible, or if elected, that the Company would not be able to repurchase MV Maunalei at the end of the lease term.  13			 		 Table of ContentsThe Company may face unexpected dry-docking or repair costs for its vessels. We routinely engage shipyards to dry-dock our vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance.  Vessels may also have to be dry-docked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage.  The cost of repairs are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial.  Large dry-docking and other repair expenses could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are not able to use our information technology and communications systems effectively, our ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted. The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  Our information technology systems rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  We have no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  If our information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if our third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of our information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers that could have an adverse effect on our business. Our information technology systems may be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees.  Despite our continuous efforts to make investments in our information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect our data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and our use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of our systems, our information technology and communication systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company’s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company’s or third-party systems could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact our ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. Loss of the Company’s key personnel could adversely affect its business. The Company’s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees.  The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s future operating results because of such employees’ experience and knowledge of the Company’s business and customer relationships.  If key employees depart, the Company may incur significant costs to replace them.  Additionally, the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner.  The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.  14			 		 Table of ContentsThe Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships. The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture, SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks such as:  ·The Company may not have voting control over the joint venture; ·The Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its joint venture partner; ·A joint venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Company’s; ·A joint venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company; ·The joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture and the Company; ·The joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; ·A joint venture partner could become bankrupt requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture; and ·Actions of the joint venture may result in reputational harm to the Company. In addition, the Company relies on the terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California, and Seattle and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or to the costs of such services provided by the Company’s terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA. The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets. Matson’s China, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:  ·Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies; ·Challenges in working with and maintaining good relationships with business associates in our foreign operations; ·Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ·Our ability to be in compliance with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials; ·Global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates; ·Not having continued access to existing port facilities; ·Competition with established and new carriers; ·Changes in vessel deployment by competitors that impact the Company’s services; ·Currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations; ·Political and economic instability; ·Dynamics involving U.S. trade relations with other countries, including measures such as the imposition of tariffs or other governmental actions, all of which may affect the Company’s operations; and ·Challenges caused by cultural differences. Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event. The Company’s vessel and terminal operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations.  As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.  15			 		 Table of ContentsThe Company’s Shipbuilding Agreements with Philly Shipyard and NASSCO are subject to risks. On November 6, 2013, MatNav and Philly Shipyard entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which Philly Shipyard will construct two new 3,600-TEU sized Aloha Class dual-fuel capable containerships.  The first vessel, MV Daniel K. Inouye, was delivered on October 31, 2018.  It is expected that the second vessel will be delivered in the first quarter of 2019.  On August 25, 2016, MatNav and NASSCO entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which NASSCO will construct two new 3,500-TEU sized Kanaloa Class dual-fuel capable container and roll-on/roll-off vessels, with expected delivery dates at the end of 2019 and 2020.  Failure of any party to the shipbuilding agreements to fulfill its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.  Such a failure could happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) delivery delays, (ii) delivery of vessels that fail to meet any of the required operating specifications (for example, capacity, fuel efficiency or speed), (iii) events in Korea which prevent one or more significant subcontractors to each of, Philly Shipyard or NASSCO from performing, or (iv) the insolvency of, or the refusal or inability to perform for any reason, by Philly Shipyard, NASSCO, or any of their respective subcontractors.  Significant delays in the delivery of the new vessels could limit our ability to replace aging steamships without substantial modifications, which could also have an adverse impact on our business plans, financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization. We are investing approximately $60 million, including the installation of three new gantry cranes and upgrade of three existing cranes, as part of the first phase of a broader project to expand and improve the Company’s Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor.  We have also begun discussions with state and local authorities in Anchorage, Alaska regarding upgrades to those terminal and port facilities.  Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the expansion and modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact on our business plans, financial condition and results of operations.   Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability. War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company’s shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions, including, for example, the Company’s acquisitions of Horizon in 2015 and Span Alaska in 2016.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Horizon and Span Alaska acquisitions may expose us to unknown liabilities. We acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015.  Similarly, in August 2016, we acquired Span Alaska subject to all of its liabilities and obligations.  The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. 16			 		 Table of Contents We may continue to be exposed to risks and liabilities related to Horizon’s former Hawaii business. Pasha acquired Horizon’s former Hawaii business immediately before we acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon’s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants.  In some cases however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.  The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded intangible assets associated with the Horizon and Span Alaska acquisitions became impaired. We recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill and customer relationships arising from the Horizon and Span Alaska acquisitions.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible customer relationships include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting unit’s financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows. Risks Relating to Financial Matters A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.   Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, as was the case in connection with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2018, which would adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.   The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, the maintenance of no more than a maximum amount of priority debt as a percentage of consolidated tangible assets, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity.  If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders resulting in a default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Company’s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants. The Company’s effective income tax rate may vary.   Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on the Company’s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company’s net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax  17			 		 Table of Contentsincome as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of CCF deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; and acquisitions and changes in the Company’s corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance. The amount of the Company’s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses. The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees. The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below).  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if a multi-employer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes. Risks Relating to Legal and Legislative Matters Compliance with safety and environmental protection and other governmental requirements may adversely affect our operations. The shipping industry in general, our business and the operation of our vessels and terminals in particular are affected by extensive and changing safety, environmental protection and other international, national, State and local governmental laws and regulations, including the following: laws pertaining to air emissions; wastewater discharges; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; and health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources.  For example, our U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained “in class” and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies, and must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard.  Federal environmental laws and certain State laws require us, as a vessel operator, to comply with numerous environmental regulations and to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up. In complying with these laws, we have incurred expenses and may incur future expenses for vessel modifications, changes in operating procedures and undergoing additional oversight inspections.  Changes in enforcement policies for existing requirements and additional laws and regulations adopted in the future could limit our ability to do business or further increase the cost of our doing business.  Our vessels’ operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels.  However, there can be no assurance that such certificates and licenses will be renewed, even though Matson maintains extensive programs and policies to ensure such renewal.  Also, in the future, we may have to alter existing equipment, add new equipment, or change operating procedures for our vessels to  18			 		 Table of Contentscomply with changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards to meet our customers’ changing needs.  If any such costs are material, they could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental laws that could result in substantial fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from vessels, which implements the International Maritime Pollution (MARPOL) treaty, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, among many other laws, treaties and regulations, provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to vessel-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles and in some cases within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone.  The EPA requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.  Matson’s vessels operate within sulfur emission control areas (SECAs) or emission control areas (ECAs).  If our vessels are not operated in accordance with these requirements, including waivers, permits or record keeping and other reporting requirements, such violations could result in substantial fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business. The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company. The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels, the Company’s business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Company’s advantage as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the U.S.‑EU Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Non-compliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including cabotage laws, government rate regulations, and environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act.  Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Company’s business.  Non-compliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Company’s business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses such as a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not be recoverable  19			 		 Table of Contentsthrough increased payments from customers.  Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company. Risks Related to Capital Structure The Company’s business could be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Company’s articles of incorporation protect the Company’s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Although the Company is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, if non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company’s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Company’s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operation.  "
2,MATX,MATSON INC,2018-02-23,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The Company’s business faces the risks set forth below, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf are qualified by the risks described below. Risks Relating To Operations Changes in U.S., global, regional economic conditions or governmental policies that result in a decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Company’s services and products in Hawaii and Alaska, the U.S. Mainland, Guam, Asia or the South Pacific may adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows. A weakening of domestic or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and freight rates.  Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii and Alaska, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth and employment, or the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, the economy in the U.S. Mainland, or the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Asia, Hawaii and Alaska, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, imposition of tariffs, or a change in international trade policies may adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company’s China service. The Company may face new or increased competition. The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company’s markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes and rates.  For example, in August 2017, TOTE announced its intent to establish a new domestic shipping service to Hawaii but subsequently announced in January 2018 that its plans are on hold as a result of its Phase 1 technical review of Piers 1 and 2 in Honolulu Harbor.  In addition in December 2016, the Company’s major competitor in the Guam service upgraded its U.S. flagged feeder containership from a bi‑weekly service to a weekly service  13 Table of Contentsconnecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan via transshipments over Yokohama, Japan and Busan, South Korea.  As a result of these and other potential competitor actions, the Company could experience a reduction in profitability. The loss of or damage to key vendor, agent and customer relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s businesses are dependent on their relationships with key vendors, agents and customers, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company’s largest customers.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or changes to the costs of services provided by key vendors and agents.  Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Company’s intermodal business as well as in the Guam, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services.   The Company’s business also relies on its relationships with the military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  In 2017, the Company’s Ocean Transportation segment’s 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of the business’ revenue.  In 2017, the Company’s Logistics segment’s 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 19 percent of the business’ revenue.  The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business and revenue. An increase in fuel prices, or changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges, may adversely affect the Company’s profits. Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company’s Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses, for example: increased energy costs, and the costs of purchased outside transportation services.  In the Company’s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel related surcharges, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations. Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by unionized workers of the Company, other workers or their unions in related industries may adversely affect the Company’s operations. As of December 31, 2017, Matson and its subsidiaries had 1,947 regular employees, of which 748 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions.  In addition, at December 31, 2016, the active Matson fleet employed seagoing personnel in 328 billets, and vessel management services employed personnel in 28 billets.  Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees, because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore.  Such employees are also subject to collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties including SSAT that employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.  For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item1.  C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I above. The Company could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices.  Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.  In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits to availability of labor through trade union hiring halts could have an adverse impact on Matson’s or SSAT’s operations. The Company is susceptible to weather, natural disasters and other operating risks. The Company’s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters, such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes.  Such events will interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal  14 Table of Contentsoperations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s vessels and their cargoes are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error.  The occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of vessels or other property, or injury or death of people.  If any of these events were to occur, the Company could be exposed to liability for resulting damages and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer.  Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for income-generating activity.   The Company maintains casualty and liability insurance policies, which are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally, are not insured.  In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance. The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.   The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   The Company may face unexpected drydock or repair costs for its vessels. We routinely engage shipyards to drydock our vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance.  Vessels may also have to be drydocked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage.  The cost of repairs are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial.  Large drydocking and other repair expenses could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are not able to use our information technology and communications systems effectively, our ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted. The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  Our information technology systems rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  We have no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  If our information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if our third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of our information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers that could have an adverse effect on our business. Our information technology systems may be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees.  Despite our continuous efforts to make investments in our information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect our data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and our use of internal processes and  15 Table of Contentscontrols designed to protect the security and availability of our systems, our information technology and communication systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company’s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company’s or third-party systems could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact our ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. Loss of the Company’s key personnel could adversely affect its business. The Company’s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees.  The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s future operating results because of such employees’ experience and knowledge of the Company’s business and customer relationships.  If key employees depart, the Company may incur significant costs to replace them.  Additionally, the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner.  The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel. The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships. The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture, SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks such as:  ·The Company may not have voting control over the joint venture; ·The Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its joint venture partner; ·A joint venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Company’s; ·A joint venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company; ·The joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture and the Company; ·The joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; ·A joint venture partner could become bankrupt requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture; and ·Actions of the joint venture may result in reputational harm to the Company. In addition, the Company relies on the terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California, and Seattle and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or to the costs of such services provided by the Company’s terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA. The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets. Matson’s China, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:  ·Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies; ·Challenges in working with and maintaining good relationships with business associates in our foreign operations; ·Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ·Our ability to be in compliance with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials; ·Global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates; 16 Table of Contents ·Not having continued access to existing port facilities; ·Competition with established and new carriers; ·Changes in vessel deployment by competitors that impact the Company’s services; ·Currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations; ·Political and economic instability; ·Protectionist measures including the imposition of tariffs that may affect the Company’s operation of its wholly-owned foreign enterprise; and ·Challenges caused by cultural differences. Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company’s Logistics segment is dependent upon third-parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected. The Company’s Logistics segment is dependent upon rail, truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third-parties.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third-parties at reasonable rates to meet its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third-parties on a temporary or permanent basis.  As a result, the Company’s business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event. The Company’s vessel and terminal operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations.  As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s Shipbuilding Agreements with Philly Shipyard and NASSCO are subject to risks. On November 6, 2013, MatNav and Philly Shipyard entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which Philly Shipyard will construct two new 3,600-TEU Aloha Class dual-fuel capable containerships, with expected delivery dates during the third quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.  On August 25, 2016, MatNav and NASSCO entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which NASSCO will construct two new 3,500-TEU Kanaloa Class dual-fuel capable container and roll-on/roll-off vessels, with expected delivery dates at the end of 2019 and mid-2020.  Failure of any party to the shipbuilding agreements to fulfill its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.  Such a failure could happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) delivery delays, (ii) delivery of vessels that fail to meet any of the required operating specifications (for example, capacity, fuel efficiency or speed), (iii) events in Korea which prevent one or more significant subcontractors to each of, Philly Shipyard or NASSCO from performing, or (iv) the insolvency of, or the refusal or inability to perform for any reason, by Philly Shipyard, NASSCO, or any of their respective subcontractors.  Significant delays in the delivery of the new vessels could limit our ability to replace aging steamships without substantial modifications, which could also have an adverse impact on our business plans, financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization. We have purchased three new gantry cranes and are upgrading three existing cranes as part of a broader project to expand and improve the Company’s Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor.  We have also begun discussions with state and local authorities in Anchorage, Alaska regarding upgrades to those terminal and port facilities.  Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact on our business plans, financial condition and results of operations.    17 Table of ContentsHeightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability. War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company’s shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Horizon and Span Alaska Acquisitions may expose us to unknown liabilities. We acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015.  Similarly, in August 2016, we acquired Span Alaska subject to all of its liabilities and obligations.  The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. We may continue to be exposed to risks and liabilities related to Horizon’s former Hawaii business. Pasha acquired Horizon’s former Hawaii business immediately before we acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon’s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants.  In some cases however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.  The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded intangible assets associated with the Horizon and Span Alaska Acquisitions became impaired. We recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill and customer relationships arising from the Horizon and Span Alaska acquisitions.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible customer relationships include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting unit’s financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows. Risks Relating to Financial Matters A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile or disruptions of the credit markets could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.     Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any  18 Table of Contentsvolatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.   The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, the maintenance of no more than a maximum amount of priority debt as a percentage of consolidated tangible assets, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity.  If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders resulting in a default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Company’s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants. The Company’s effective income tax rate may vary.   Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on the Company’s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company’s net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”), regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of CCF deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; and acquisitions and changes in the Company’s corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance. The amount of the Company’s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses. The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees. The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below).  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the  19 Table of Contentsplan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if a multi-employer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes. Risks Relating to Legal and Legislative Matters Compliance with safety and environmental protection and other governmental requirements may adversely affect our operations. The shipping industry in general, our business and the operation of our vessels and terminals in particular are affected by extensive and changing safety, environmental protection and other international, national, State and local governmental laws and regulations, including the following: laws pertaining to air emissions; wastewater discharges; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; and health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources.  For example, our U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained “in class” and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies, and must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard.  Federal environmental laws and certain State laws require us, as a vessel operator, to comply with numerous environmental regulations and to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up. In complying with these laws, we have incurred expenses and may incur future expenses for vessel modifications, changes in operating procedures and undergoing additional oversight inspections.  Changes in enforcement policies for existing requirements and additional laws and regulations adopted in the future could limit our ability to do business or further increase the cost of our doing business.  Our vessels’ operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels.  However, there can be no assurance that such certificates and licenses will be renewed, even though Matson maintains extensive programs and policies to ensure such renewal.  Also, in the future, we may have to alter existing equipment, add new equipment, or change operating procedures for our vessels to comply with changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards to meet our customers’ changing needs.  If any such costs are material, they could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental laws that could result in substantial fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from vessels, which implements the International Maritime Pollution (MARPOL) treaty, and the Oil Pollution Action of 1990 (OPA-90), among many other laws, treaties and regulations, provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to vessel-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles and in some cases within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone.  The EPA requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.  Matson’s vessels operate within sulfur emission control areas (SECAs) or emission control areas (ECAs).  If our vessels are not operated in accordance with these requirements, including waivers, permits or record keeping and other reporting requirements, such violations could result in substantial fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business. The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company. The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations, relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.  20 Table of ContentsRepeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels, the Company’s business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Company’s advantage as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Non-compliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including cabotage laws, government rate regulations, and environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act.  Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Company’s business.  Non-compliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Company’s business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses such as a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.  Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company. Risks Related to Capital Structure The Company’s business could be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Company’s articles of incorporation protect the Company’s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Although the Company is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, if non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company’s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Company’s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operation. "
0,MATX,MATSON INC,2017-02-24,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The Company’s business faces the risks set forth below, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf are qualified by the risks described below. Risks Relating To Operations Changes in U.S., global, regional economic conditions or governmental policies that result in a decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Company’s services and products in Hawaii and Alaska, the U.S. Mainland, Guam, Asia or the South Pacific may adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows. A weakening of domestic or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and freight rates.  Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii and Alaska, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth and employment, or the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, the economy in the U.S. Mainland, or the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Asia, Hawaii and Alaska, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, imposition of tariffs, or a change in international trade policies may adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company’s China service. The Company may face new or increased competition. The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company’s markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes and rates.  In 2016, the Company’s major competitor in the Guam service upgraded its U.S. flagged feeder containership from a bi-weekly service to a weekly service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan via transshipments over Yokohama, Japan and Busan, South Korea.  As a result of these and other competitor actions, the Company could experience some reduction in profitability. The loss of or damage to key vendor, agent and customer relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s businesses are dependent on their relationships with key vendors, agents and customers, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company’s largest customers.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or changes to the costs of services provided by key vendors and agents.  Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Company’s intermodal business.   The Company’s business also relies on its relationships with the military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  In 2016, the Company’s Ocean Transportation segment’s 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24 percent of the business’ revenue.  In 2016, the Company’s Logistics segment’s 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 22 percent of the business’ revenue.  The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business and revenue. 11 Table of Contents An increase in fuel prices, or changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges, may adversely affect the Company’s profits. Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company’s Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses, for example: increased energy costs, and the costs of purchased outside transportation services.  In the Company’s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company is able to utilize fuel surcharges to partially recover increases in fuel expense, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations. Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by unionized workers of the Company, other workers or their unions in related industries may adversely affect the Company’s operations. As of December 31, 2016, Matson and its subsidiaries had 1,925 regular employees, of which 712 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions.  In addition, at December 31, 2016, the active Matson fleet employed seagoing personnel in 355 billets, and vessel management services employed personnel in 28 billets.  Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees, because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore.  Such employees are also subject to collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties including SSAT that employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.  For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item 1. C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I above. The Company could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices.  Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully. In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits to availability of labor through trade union hiring halts could have an adverse impact on Matson’s or SSAT’s operations The Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters. The Company’s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters, such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes.  Such events will interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company maintains casualty and liability insurance policies, which are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally, are not insured.  In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance. The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.    12 Table of ContentsIf we are not able to use our information technology and communications systems effectively, our ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted. The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  Our information technology systems rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  We have no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  If our information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if our third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of our information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers that could have an adverse effect on our business. Our information technology systems may be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  Despite our continuous efforts to make investments in our information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect our data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and our use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of our systems, our information technology and communication systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company’s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company’s or third-party systems could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact our ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. Loss of the Company’s key personnel could adversely affect its business. The Company’s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees.  The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company’s future operating results because of such employees’ experience and knowledge of the Company’s business and customer relationships.  If key employees depart, the Company may incur significant costs to replace them.  Additionally, the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner.  The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel. The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships. The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture, SSAT, and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks such as:  ·The Company may not have voting control over the joint venture; ·The Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its joint venture partner; ·The joint venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Company’s; ·The joint venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company; ·The joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture and the Company; ·The joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; ·The joint venture partner could become bankrupt requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture; and 13 Table of Contents ·Actions of the joint venture may result in reputational harm to the Company. In addition, the Company relies on the terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA for its stevedoring services on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or to the costs of such services provided by the Company’s terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA. The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets. Matson’s China, Micronesia and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:  ·Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies; ·Challenges in working with and maintaining good relationships with business associates in our foreign operations; ·Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ·Our ability to be in compliance with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials; ·Global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates; ·Not having continued access to existing port facilities; ·Competition with established and new carriers; ·Currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations; ·Political and economic instability; ·Protectionist measures including the imposition of tariffs that may affect the Company’s operation of its wholly-owned foreign enterprise; and ·Challenges caused by cultural differences. Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company’s Logistics segment is dependent upon third-parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected. The Company’s Logistics segment is dependent upon rail, truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third-parties.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third-parties at reasonable rates to meet its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third-parties on a temporary or permanent basis.  As a result, the Company’s business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event. The Company’s vessel and terminal operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations.  As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s Shipbuilding Agreements with Philly Shipyard and NASSCO are subject to risks. On November 6, 2013, MatNav and Philly Shipyard entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which Philly Shipyard will construct two new 3,600-TEU Aloha Class dual-fuel capable containerships, with expected delivery dates during the third quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.  On August 25, 2016, MatNav and NASSCO entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which NASSCO will construct two new 3,500-TEU Kanaloa Class dual-fuel capable container and roll-on/roll-off vessels, with expected delivery dates at the end of 2019 and mid-2020.  Failure of any party to the shipbuilding agreements to fulfill its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.  14 Table of ContentsHeightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability. War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting Hawaii’s economy and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company’s shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Span Alaska and Horizon Acquisitions may expose us to unknown liabilities. We acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015.  Similarly, we acquired Span Alaska subject to all of its liabilities and obligations.  The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. We may continue to be exposed to risks and liabilities related to Horizon’s former Hawaii business. Pasha acquired Horizon’s former Hawaii business immediately before we acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon’s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants.  In some cases however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.  The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded intangible assets associated with the Span Alaska and Horizon Acquisitions became impaired. We recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill and customer relationships arising from the Horizon and Span Alaska acquisitions.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible customer relationships include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting unit’s financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows. Risks Relating to Financial Matters A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile or disruptions of the credit markets could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. Deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any  15 Table of Contentsvolatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company. The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, the maintenance of no more than a maximum amount of priority debt as a percentage of consolidated tangible assets, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity.  If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders resulting in a default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Company’s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants. The Company’s effective income tax rate may vary. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on the Company’s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company’s net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of CCF deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; acquisitions and changes in the Company’s corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations. Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance. The amount of the Company’s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses. The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees. The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below).  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be  16 Table of Contentsliable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if a multi-employer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes. Risks Relating to Legal and Legislative Matters Compliance with safety and environmental protection and other governmental requirements may adversely affect our operations. The shipping industry in general, our business and the operation of our vessels and terminals in particular are affected by extensive and changing safety, environmental protection and other international, national, State and local governmental laws and regulations, including the following: laws pertaining to air emissions; wastewater discharges; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; and health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources.  For example, our U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained “in class” and are subject to periodic inspections by ABS Quality Evaluation, Inc., or similar classification societies, and must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard.  Federal environmental laws and certain State laws require us, as a vessel operator, to comply with numerous environmental regulations and to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up. In complying with these laws, we have incurred expenses and may incur future expenses for vessel modifications and changes in operating procedures.  Changes in enforcement policies for existing requirements and additional laws and regulations adopted in the future could limit our ability to do business or further increase the cost of our doing business.  Our vessels’ operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels.  However, there can be no assurance that such certificates and licenses will be renewed, even though Matson maintains extensive programs and policies to ensure such renewal.  Also, in the future, we may have to alter existing equipment, add new equipment, or change operating procedures for our vessels to comply with changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards to meet our customers’ changing needs.  If any such costs are material, they could adversely affect our financial condition. If we are unable to comply with changing EPA regulations regarding fuel and emissions, it may adversely impact our ongoing operations. Most of Matson’s vessels operate a portion of their voyages in designated ECAs, while Matson’s Alaska vessels operate a substantial portion of their voyages in ECAs.  Beginning January 2012, the EPA issued new regulations regarding the sulfur content of fuel oils utilized by vessels operating in ECAs.  Beginning January 1, 2015, these emission regulations require the sulfur content of fuel oil utilized by vessels operating inside ECAs not to exceed 0.1 percent.  In 2014, Matson received a conditional waiver from the EPA ECA regulations for three diesel-powered vessels used in the Hawaii service that permits the continued use of 1.0 percent sulfur fuel for a limited time, subject to our development of technologies that monitor main engine performance and promote full power operation on diesel fuels with a sulfur content of less than 0.1 percent.  The conditional waiver is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2017, but contains the possibility of a two-year extension provision.  If Matson were unable to obtain such extension, Matson would operate these vessels on 0.1 percent sulfur fuel at lower speeds in the designated ECAs. This could cause certain vessels to not maintain schedule which could adversely affect our business and ongoing operations.   We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental laws that could result in substantial fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from vessels, which implements the International Maritime Pollution (MARPOL) treaty, and the Oil Pollution Action of 1990 (OPA-90), among many other laws, treaties and regulations, provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to vessel-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles and in some cases within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone.  The EPA requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.  Matson’s vessels operate within sulfur emission control areas (SECAs) or emission control areas (ECAs).  If our vessels are not operated in accordance with these requirements, including record keeping and other reporting requirements, such violations could result in substantial fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business.  17 Table of ContentsThe Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company. The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations, relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels, the Company’s business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Company’s advantage as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Non-compliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including cabotage laws, government rate regulations, and environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act.  Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Company’s business.  Non-compliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Company’s business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses such as a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.  Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company. Risks Related to Capital Structure The Company’s business could be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Company’s articles of incorporation protect the Company’s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Although the Company is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, if non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company’s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Company’s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operation. "
1,MATX,MATSON INC,2016-02-26,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The Companys business faces the risks set forth below, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Companys behalf are qualified by the risks described below. Risks Relating To Operations Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions that result in a decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Companys services and products in Hawaii and Alaska, the U.S. Mainland, Guam, Asia or the  South Pacific may adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows. A weakening of domestic or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and freight rates.  Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii and Alaska, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth and employment, or the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, the economy in the U.S. Mainland, or the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Asia, Hawaii and Alaska, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets or a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates may adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Companys China service. The Company may face new or increased competition. The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Companys markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Companys routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes and rates.  The Companys major competitor in the Hawaii market introduced a new vessel in 2015, and also acquired Horizons Hawaii service, which could adversely impact the Companys Hawaii service.  In addition, at the beginning of 2016, American President Lines (APL) launched a U.S. flagged feeder containership bi-weekly service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan via transshipments over Yokohama, Japan.  As a result of these and other competitor actions, the Company could experience some competition related volume losses. The loss of or damage to key vendor, agent and customer relationships may adversely affect the Companys business. The Companys businesses are dependent on their relationships with key vendors, agents and customers, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Companys largest customers.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or changes to the costs of services provided by key vendors and agents.  Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Companys intermodal business.  The Companys business also relies on its relationships with the military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  In 2015, the Companys Ocean Transportation segments 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of the business revenue.  In 2015, the Companys Logistics segments 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of the business revenue.  The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Companys business and revenue. An increase in fuel prices, or changes in the Companys ability to collect fuel surcharges, may adversely affect the Companys profits. Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Companys Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Companys control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Companys results of operations based on market and competitive conditions.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses, for example: increased energy costs, and the costs of purchased outside transportation services.  In the Companys Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company is able to utilize fuel surcharges to partially recover increases in fuel expense, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Companys competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Companys ability to collect fuel surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations. Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by unionized workers of the Company, other workers or their unions in related industries may adversely affect the Companys operations. As of December 31, 2015, Matson and its subsidiaries had 1,663 regular employees, of which 650 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions.  In addition, at December 31, 2015, the active Matson fleet employed seagoing 8Table of Contents personnel in 325 billets.  Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees, because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore.  Such employees are also subject to collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties including SSAT and its parent company, SSA, that employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.  For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item 1. B. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I above. The Company could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices.  Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully. In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits to availability of labor through trade union hiring halts could have an adverse impact on Matsons or SSATs operations The Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters. The Companys operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes.  Such events will interfere with the Companys ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Companys terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. The Company maintains casualty and liability insurance policies, which are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally, are not insured.  In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance. The Companys significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Companys future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company is currently in the process of renewing its terminal lease facilities at Anchorage, Alaska. If we are not able to use our information technology and communications systems effectively, our ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted. The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  Our information technology systems rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  We have no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  If our information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if our third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of our information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers that could have an adverse effect on our business. Our information technology systems may be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Companys ability to operate and adversely affect its business. The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers, including for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  Despite our continuous efforts to make investments in our information technology systems, the implementation of security measures to protect our data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and our use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of our systems, our information technology and communication systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks faced by other large companies in our industry.  Our systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Companys facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. 9Table of Contents Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Companys or third-party systems could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact our ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. Loss of the Companys key personnel could adversely affect its business. The Companys future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees.  The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Companys future operating results because of such employees experience and knowledge of the Companys business and customer relationships.  If key employees depart, the Company may incur significant costs to replace them.  Additionally, the Companys ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner.  The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel. The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships. The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture, SSAT, and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks such as: ·                  The Company may not have voting control over the joint venture;·                  The Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its joint venture partner;·                  The joint venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Companys;·                  The joint venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company;·                  The joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture and the Company;·                  The joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel;·                  The joint venture partner could become bankrupt requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture; and·                  Actions of the joint venture may result in reputational harm to the Company. In addition, the Company relies on the terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA for its stevedoring services on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or to the costs of such services provided by the Companys terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA. The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets. Matsons China, Micronesia and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include: ·                  Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies;·                  Challenges in working with and maintaining good relationships with joint venture partners in our foreign operations;·                  Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;·                  Our ability to be in compliance with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials;·                  Global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates;·                  Not having continued access to existing port facilities;·                  Competition with established and new carriers;·                  Currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations;·                  Political and economic instability;·                  Protectionist measures that may affect the Companys operation of its wholly-owned foreign enterprise; and·                  Challenges caused by cultural differences. Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Companys operating results. 10Table of Contents The Companys Logistics segment is dependent upon third-parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected. The Companys Logistics segment is dependent upon rail, truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third-parties.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third-parties at reasonable rates to meet its customers needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third-parties on a temporary or permanent basis.  As a result, the Companys business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event. The Companys vessel and terminal operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations.  As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. The Companys Shipbuilding Agreements with Philly Shipyard are subject to risks. On November 6, 2013, MatNav and Philly Shipyard (formerly known as Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, Inc.) entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which APSI will construct two new 3,600-TEU Aloha-class dual-fuel capable containerships, with expected delivery dates during the third quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.  Failure of either party to the shipbuilding agreements to fulfill its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Companys operations and profitability. War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting Hawaiis economy and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Companys shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matsons vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Companys business. The Companys growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Companys capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Higher than expected costs associated with the continuing integration of Horizon could adversely impact our results, financial position, liquidity or cash flow. The Company expects to benefit from various cost saving initiatives as part of the integration process related to the Horizon Acquisition.  Integration cost savings expectations are in the areas of corporate office closures and headcount reductions, information technology expense reductions, as well as customer service and marketing expense reductions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve the expected integration cost savings or that the cost savings will be achieved within the planned 24-month post-closing period.  The lack of or delay in integration cost savings could have a materially adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. The Horizon Acquisition may expose us to unknown liabilities. We acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015.  Such liabilities include the estimated cost of the multi-employer withdrawal liability related to the ILA-PRSSA pension plan (See Note 3 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II below).  The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. 11Table of Contents We may continue to be exposed to risks and liabilities related to Horizons former Hawaii business. Pasha acquired Horizons former Hawaii business immediately before we acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizons Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants.  In some cases however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.  The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded intangible assets associated with the Horizon Acquisition become impaired. We recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill and customer relationships arising from the Horizon Acquisition.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible customer relationships include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting units financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows. We may be required to record future charges to earnings if goodwill associated with the Horizon Acquisition become impaired.  Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results. Risks Relating to Financial Matters A deterioration of the Companys credit profile or disruptions of the credit markets could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. Deterioration in the Companys credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Companys credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Companys credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Companys credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Companys cash flow and results of operations. Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Companys credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Companys business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company. The Companys credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include the maintenance of minimum shareholders equity levels, a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and the maintenance of no more than a maximum amount of priority debt as a percentage of consolidated tangible assets.  If the Company does not maintain the required covenants, and that breach of covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in default, the Companys access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Companys continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants. The Companys effective income tax rate may vary. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on the Companys effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Companys net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Companys ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of CCF deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; acquisitions and changes in the Companys corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect the Companys cash flow and results of operations. 12Table of Contents Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Companys financial performance. The amount of the Companys employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Companys operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Companys single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Companys businesses. The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Companys employees. The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plans unfunded vested benefits (See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II below).  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plans unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if a multi-employer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes. Risks Relating to Legal and Legislative Matters Compliance with safety and environmental protection and other governmental requirements may adversely affect our operations. The shipping industry in general, our business and the operation of our vessels and terminals in particular are affected by extensive and changing safety, environmental protection and other international, national, State and local governmental laws and regulations, including the following: laws pertaining to air emissions; wastewater discharges; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; and health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources.  For example, our U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained in class and are subject to periodic inspections by ABS Quality Evaluation, Inc., or similar classification societies, and must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard.  Federal environmental laws and certain State laws require us, as a vessel operator, to comply with numerous environmental regulations and to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up. In complying with these laws, we have incurred expenses and may incur future expenses for vessel modifications and changes in operating procedures.  Changes in enforcement policies for existing requirements and additional laws and regulations adopted in the future could limit our ability to do business or further increase the cost of our doing business.  Our vessels operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels.  However, there can be no assurance that such certificates and licenses will be renewed, even though Matson maintains extensive programs and policies to ensure such renewal.  Also, in the future, we may have to alter existing equipment, add new equipment, or change operating procedures for our vessels to comply with changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards to meet our customers changing needs.  If any such costs are material, they could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental laws that could result in substantial fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from vessels, which implements the International Maritime Pollution (MARPOL) treaty, and the Oil Pollution Action of 1990 (OPA-90), among many other laws, treaties and regulations, provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to vessel-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles and in some cases within the 200-mile 13Table of Contents exclusive economic zone.  The EPA requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.  Matsons vessels operate within surplus emission control areas (SECAs) or emission control areas (ECAs).  If our vessels are not operated in accordance with these requirements, including record keeping and other reporting requirements, such violations could result in substantial fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business. If we are unable to comply with changing EPA regulations regarding fuel and emissions, it may adversely impact our ongoing operations. Most of Matsons vessels operate a portion of their voyages in designated ECAs, while Matsons Alaska vessels operate a substantial portion of their voyages in ECAs.  Beginning January 2012, the EPA issued new regulations regarding the sulfur content of fuel oils utilized by vessels operating in ECAs.  Beginning January 1, 2015, these emission regulations require the sulfur content of fuel oil utilized by vessels operating inside ECAs not to exceed 0.1 percent.  In 2014, Matson received a conditional waiver from the EPA ECA regulations for three diesel-powered vessels used in the Hawaii service that permits the continued use of 1percent sulfur fuel for a limited time, subject to our development of technologies that monitor main engine performance and promote full power operation on diesel fuels with a sulfur content of less than 0.1 percent. Effective in 2015, Horizon received a conditional waiver (subsequently transferred to Matson pursuant to the Horizon Acquisition) from the EPA ECA regulations for three diesel-powered vessels used in the Alaska service that permits the continued use of these vessels burning higher sulfur content fuel for a limited time, subject to the installation and testing of an exhaust gas cleaning system (known as scrubbers) on such vessels.  The conditional waiver includes a schedule by which such installation and testing to be completed, with dates of installation ranging from the second half of 2015 to the end of 2016. If we are not able to install the scrubbers by the applicable deadline, or we are otherwise unable to comply with our obligations under the conditional waiver, the conditional waiver may terminate.  Even if we are able to meet the requirements of the conditional waiver, there is no assurance that the scrubbers will be successful in reducing emissions and producing results that comply with the EPA ECA regulations.  In such situation, the Company would be required to operate these vessels utilizing low sulfur fuel, which could risk damaging the existing engines unless they are run at low speeds.  Lower speeds, however, could cause schedule delays or require us to operate additional vessels in Alaska and incur additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Also, the operation of scrubbers involves the transportation of hazardous materials that in themselves create a risk. The Company is subject to risks related to removal of the molasses tank farm and pier risers at Sand Island Terminal in Honolulu. Pursuant to the Companys settlement with the State of Hawaii to resolve all of the States claims arising from the discharge of molasses into the Honolulu Harbor in September 2013, the Company agreed to remove the molasses tank farm and pier risers at the Sand Island Terminal in Honolulu.  The Company hired an engineering consulting firm to develop plans to remove the items safely and developed a Spill Prevention and Response Plan.  Despite these precautions, molasses could be released into the environment during demolition activities.  This could lead to suspension of operations, third-party or governmental agency claims, disputes, legal or other proceedings, fines, penalties, natural resource damages, inquiries or investigations or other regulatory actions.  As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company. The nature of the Companys business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations, relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matsons tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. 14Table of Contents Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Companys business. If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels, the Companys business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Companys advantage as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Non-compliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Companys business. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including cabotage laws, government rate regulations, and environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act.  Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Companys business.  Non-compliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Companys business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses such as a cap and trade system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.  Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company. Risks Related to Capital Structure The Companys business could be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Companys articles of incorporation protect the Companys ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Although the Company is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, if non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Companys common stock, the Company would no longer be considered as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Companys ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, which could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operation. "
10,MATX,MATSON INC,2015-02-27,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The Companys business faces the risks set forth below, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Companys behalf are qualified by the risks described below. Risks Relating To Operations Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions that result in a decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Companys services and products in Hawaii, the U.S. Mainland, Guam, Asia or South Pacific may adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows. A weakening of the U.S., Guam, Asian, South Pacific or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and freight rates.  Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth, and employment, or the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, the economy in the U.S. Mainland, or the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Hawaii and Asia, travel to Hawaii and domestic transportation of goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  We are unable to determine the full impact of congressional budget action on our carriage of military cargo, but we believe it continues to negatively impact us, and we could continue to be impacted by future cuts to federal programs, including Defense Department programs as a result of congressional budget action.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets or a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates may adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Companys China service. 7Table of Contents The Company may face new or increased competition. The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Companys markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of ships or capacity by existing competition on any of the Companys routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes and rates. One current competitor, Pasha, expects to launch a new combination container/ roll-on/roll off vessel during the first half of 2015, which will increase containership capacity in the Hawaii trade, and could affect rates and volumes in the Hawaii trade lane on an intermediate term basis.  In addition, Pasha has agreed to buy Horizons Hawaii business, which could alter the competitive dynamics in the Hawaii trade. The loss of or damage to key vendor, agent and customer relationships may adversely affect the Companys business. The Companys businesses are dependent on their relationships with key vendors, agents and customers, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Companys largest customers.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or changes to the costs of services provided by key vendors and agents.  Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Companys intermodal business.  The Companys business also relies on its relationships with the military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  For 2014, the Companys Ocean Transportation segments ten largest customers accounted for approximately 25 percent of the business revenue.  For 2014, the Companys Logistics segments ten largest customers accounted for approximately 26 percent of the business revenue.  The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Companys business and revenue. An increase in fuel prices, or changes in the Companys ability to collect fuel surcharges, may adversely affect the Companys profits. Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Companys Ocean Transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Companys control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Companys results of operations based on market and competitive conditions.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to other expense increases, for example, increased costs of energy and purchased transportation services.  In the Companys Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company is able to utilize fuel surcharges to partially recover increases in fuel expense, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Companys competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Companys ability to collect fuel surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations. Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by unionized workers of the Company, other workers or their unions in related industries may adversely affect the Companys operations. As of December 31, 2014, Matson and its subsidiaries had 1,056 employees, of which 285 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions.  Of these covered employees, 252 are subject to collective bargaining agreements that expired in 2014.  In addition, at December 31, 2014, the active Matson fleet employed seagoing personnel in 235 billets.  Each billet corresponds to a position on a ship that typically is filled by two or more employees, because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore.  Such employees are also subject to collective bargaining agreements.  Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties including SSAT and its parent company, SSA, that employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements. Matson and SSAT are members of the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) on the U.S. West Coast.  The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements that cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor expired on July 1, 2014.  On February 20, 2015, the PMA and the ILWU announced a tentative agreement on a new five-year contract covering longshore workers at all 29 U.S. West Coast ports.  The tentative agreement is subject to ratification by both the PMA and ILWU, and no assurance can be given that the tentative agreement will be ratified by both parties.  If the tentative agreement is not ratified, Matson and SSAT could be subject to future slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matsons or SSATs operations. Matson also has collective bargaining agreements with ILWU labor in Hawaii, and ILWU office clerical workers in Oakland, each of which expired on June 30, 2014.  Workers under these agreements are operating under extensions with the unions.  With a tentative agreement reached between the PMA and the ILWU, negotiations with the ILWU labor in Hawaii are expected to resume, and negotiations with the ILWU office clerical workers in Oakland are expected to commence; however no assurance can be given that agreements will be reached without slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matsons operations.8Table of Contents The Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters. The Companys operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes.  Such events will interfere with the Companys ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Companys terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. The Company maintains casualty and liability insurance policies, which are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally are not insured.  In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance. The Companys significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Companys future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company leases a 105-acre marine terminal at Honolulu, Hawaii that expires in September 2016.  The Company is currently in the process of renewing this lease. If we are not able to use our information technology and communications systems effectively, our ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted. The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively.  Our information technology systems rely on third party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers.  We have no control over the operations of these third-party service providers.  If our information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if our third party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of our information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or a loss of customers that could have an adverse effect on our business. Our information technology systems may be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Companys ability to operate and adversely affect its business. The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third party service providers, including for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  Despite our continuous efforts to make investments in our information technology systems, the implementation of security measures to protect our data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and our use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of our systems, our information technology and communication systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks faced by other large companies in our industry.  Our systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Companys facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations.  Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Companys or third-party systems could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact our ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. Loss of the Companys key personnel could adversely affect its business. The Companys future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees.  The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Companys future operating results because of such employees experience and knowledge of the Companys business and customer relationships.  If key employees depart, the Company may have to incur significant costs to replace them, and the Companys ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner.  The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel. 9Table of Contents The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships. The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture, SSAT, and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks such as: ·                  The Company may not have voting control over the joint venture;·                  The Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its joint venture partner;·                  The joint venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Companys;·                  The joint venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company;·                  The joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture and the Company;·                  The joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; and·                  The joint venture partner could become bankrupt requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture. In addition, the Company relies on the terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA for its stevedoring services on the U.S. West Coast.  The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or to the costs of such services provided by the Companys terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA. The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets. Matsons China, Micronesia and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include: ·                  Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies;·                  Challenges in working with and maintaining good relationships with joint venture partners in our foreign operations;·                  Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;·                  U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials;·                  Global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates;·                  Competition with established and new carriers;·                  Currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations;·                  Political and economic instability;·                  Protectionist measures that may affect the Companys operation of its wholly-owned foreign enterprise; and·                  Challenges caused by cultural differences. Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Companys Logistics segment is dependent upon third parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate the Companys Logistics business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third party services, its business could be adversely affected. The Companys Logistics segment is dependent upon rail, truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third parties.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third parties at reasonable rates to meet its customers needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third parties on a temporary or permanent basis.  As a result, the Companys business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event. The Companys vessel and terminal operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations.  As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. 10Table of Contents The Companys Shipbuilding Agreements with Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, Inc. are subject to risks. On November 6, 2013, MatNav and APSI entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which APSI will construct two new 3,600-TEU Aloha-class dual-fuel capable containerships, with expected delivery dates during the third and fourth quarters of 2018.  Failure of either party to the shipbuilding agreement to fulfill its obligations under the agreement could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Companys operations and profitability. War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting Hawaiis economy and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Companys shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matsons vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Companys business. The Companys growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Companys capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  For a discussion of risks related to the pending acquisition of the stock of Horizon Lines, Inc., see Risks Related to the Pending Acquisition of Horizon set forth below. Risks Relating to the Pending Acquisition of Horizon The pending acquisition of Horizon is subject to conditions that may not be satisfied on a timely basis, or at all. The consummation of the pending acquisition of Horizon is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived, including, among others, the absence of a material adverse effect in connection with Horizons non-Hawaii business and that there is no significant financial impact as a result of Horizon operating the main engines on its Alaska ships on ultra-low-sulfur fuel (Horizon announced it received an exemption from the requirement that it operate its ships on ultra-low-sulfur fuel on January 9, 2015).  There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing the merger will be satisfied or that the merger will be completed. If the acquisition of Horizon is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, the Companys business could be adversely affected, and the Company will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: ·                  We may not realize any of the benefits expected from its consummation;·                  Time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the acquisition of Horizon (including integration planning) could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and·                  The market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the acquisition of Horizon will be completed. This loss of benefits, or the increase in risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Completion of the Horizon acquisition is conditioned upon the consummation of Horizons pending transaction with Pasha, which may take longer than expected or not occur at all. The consummation of the Horizon Transaction is conditioned upon the completion of the Pasha Transaction.  Before the Pasha Transaction may be completed, the waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended must have been terminated or expired, Pasha must have funds necessary to pay its purchase price, and other customary closing conditions must be satisfied.  On January 12, 2015, Horizon and Pasha received a second request for additional information and documentary material from the U.S. Department of Justice, which has the effect of extending the waiting period until 30 days after both Horizon and Pasha have substantially complied with the second request.  Although Horizon and Pasha have agreed to use their best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals, there can be no assurances that these approvals will be obtained, or to the timing of such approvals. 11Table of Contents The Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Horizon acquisition, and the continuing integration process could adversely impact our ongoing operations. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Horizon acquisition if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected or otherwise fails to meet our expectations.  In addition, we anticipate that the overall integration of Horizons non-Hawaii business will be a time-consuming and expensive process that could significantly disrupt our business. Potential difficulties and challenges we may encounter in the integration process include the following: ·                  The integration of key employees, strategies and operations;·                  The disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of our management team from ongoing business concerns;·                  The creation of a need for additional compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures;·                  Costs necessary to establish and maintain effective internal controls for Horizon;·                  Inability to maintain the key business and customer relationships of Horizon;·                  Harm to our existing business relationships;·                  Litigation for activities of Horizon, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;·                  The creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; and·                  The integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale. The acquisition of Horizon may expose us to unknown liabilities. Following the completion of the acquisition of Horizon, we will be subject to all of the liabilities of Horizons non-Hawaii business.  If there are unknown liabilities or other obligations, including contingent liabilities, our business could be materially affected.  We may learn additional information about Horizons non-Hawaii business that adversely affects us, such as unknown liabilities or other issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws.  Moreover, Horizon may not be able to collect in full on its indemnification rights against Hawaii liabilities under the agreements in the Pasha Transaction. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded goodwill associated with the Horizon Acquisition becomes impaired. Following the completion of the acquisition of Horizon, we expect to record a significant intangible asset related to goodwill.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that its carrying amount.  Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting units financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows. We may be required to record future charges to earnings if goodwill associated with the Horizon Acquisition become impaired.  Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results. We have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, substantial expenses related to the pending acquisition. We have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, substantial expenses in connection with completing the acquisition of Horizon and integrating the operations of Horizon with our operations.  While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of our transaction and integration expenses.  Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time.  As a result, the transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Horizon could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of Horizon following the completion of the acquisition of Horizon. Risks Relating to Financial Matters A deterioration of the Companys credit profile or disruptions of the credit markets could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. Deterioration in the Companys credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Companys credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt  12Table of Contents capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms.  Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Companys credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Companys credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Companys cash flow and results of operations. Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Companys credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Companys business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company. The Companys credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include the maintenance of minimum shareholders equity levels, a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and the maintenance of no more than a maximum amount of priority debt as a percentage of consolidated tangible assets.  If the Company does not maintain the required covenants, and that breach of covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in default, the Companys access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Companys continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants. The Companys effective income tax rate may vary. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on the Companys effective income tax rate and, therefore, the Companys net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the Companys evaluation of collectability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of CCF deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; acquisitions and changes in the Companys corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect the Companys cash flow and results of operations. Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Companys financial performance. The amount of the Companys employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Companys operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Companys single-employer and multiemployer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that it will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Companys businesses. The Company may have exposure under its multiemployer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Companys employees. The Company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plans unfunded vested benefits.  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member in its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plans unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if a multiemployer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes. 13Table of Contents Risks Relating to Legal and Legislative Matters The impact of the molasses release in September 2013 may have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company could be faced with regulatory compliance obligations, third party or governmental agency claims, disputes, legal or other proceedings, fines, penalties, natural resource damages, inquiries or investigations or other regulatory actions in connection with the release of molasses into Honolulu Harbor in September 2013.  The Company cannot currently estimate the potential impact of any such events, but such events could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matsons tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  See Legal Proceedings below. The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, that could have an adverse effect on the Company. The nature of the Companys business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matsons tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.  For a description of significant legal proceedings involving the Company, see Legal Proceedings below. Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels, the Companys business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Companys advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Non-compliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Companys business. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including cabotage laws, government rate regulations, and environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, including, but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act.  Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Companys business.  Noncompliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Companys business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.  Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company.  Climate change legislation, such as limiting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a cap and trade system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may have an adverse effect on the Companys business. 14Table of Contents Risks Related to Capital Structure The Companys business could be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Companys articles of incorporation protect the Companys ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Although the Company believes it currently is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, if non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Companys common stock, the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Companys ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, which could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operation. "
14,MATX,MATSON INC,2014-02-28,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The Companys business faces the risks set forth below, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Companys behalf are qualified by the risks described below. Risks Relating To Operations Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions that result in a decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Companys services and products in Hawaii, the U.S. Mainland, Guam, Asia or South Pacific may adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows. A continuation or further weakening of the U.S., Guam, Asian, South Pacific or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and freight rates.  Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth, and employment, or the further weakening of consumer confidence, market demand or the economy in the U.S. Mainland, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Hawaii and Asia, travel to Hawaii and domestic transportation of goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  We are unable to determine the full impact of sequestration on our carriage of military cargo, but we believe it continues to negatively impact us, and we could continue to be impacted by future cuts to federal programs, including Defense Department programs as a result of federal sequestration.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets or a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates may adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Companys China service. The Company may face new or increased competition. The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Companys markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of ships or capacity by existing competition on any of the Companys routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes and rates. One current competitor, Pasha, announced that it intends to place a second ship into its Hawaii service in the second half of 2014.  We expect there to be a period of competitive disruption impacting rates and volumes following this market entry that would impact all carriers in the Hawaii trade, including Matson. The loss of or damage to key vendor, agent and customer relationships may adversely affect the Companys business. The Companys businesses are dependent on their relationships with key vendors, agents and customers, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Companys largest customers.  The Companys business relies on its relationships with the military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers.  Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Companys intermodal business.  For 2013, the Companys ocean transportation business ten largest customers accounted for approximately 24 percent of the business revenue.  For 2013, the Companys logistics business ten largest customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of the business revenue.  The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Companys business and revenue. 8Table of Contents An increase in fuel prices, or changes in the Companys ability to collect fuel surcharges, may adversely affect the Companys profits. Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Companys ocean transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Companys control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Companys results of operations based on market and competitive conditions.  Increases in fuel costs also can lead to other expense increases, for example, increased costs of energy and purchased transportation services.  In the Companys ocean transportation and logistics services segments, the Company is able to utilize fuel surcharges to partially recover increases in fuel expense, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Companys competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense.  Changes in the Companys ability to collect fuel surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations. Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of the Company or other companies in related industries may adversely affect the Companys operations. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had 1,036 regular full-time employees, of which 272 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions.  Of these covered employees, 249 are subject to collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2014, and include ILWU contracts on the U.S. Pacific Coast and in Hawaii.  In addition, the Company relies on the services of third-parties who employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements, including SSAT.  The Company could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices.  Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of the Company or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully. The Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters. The Companys operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes.  Such events will interfere with the Companys ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Companys terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. The Company maintains casualty and liability insurance policies.  These policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles.  Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally are not insured.  In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk.  Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available.  Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance. The Companys significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Companys future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Interruption or failure of the Companys information technology and communications systems could impair the Companys ability to operate and adversely affect its business. The Company is highly dependent on information technology systems.  These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems.  All information technology and communication 9Table of Contents systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions.  The Company may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at the Companys facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations.  Any failure of the Companys or third-party systems could result in interruptions in its service or production, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information. Loss of the Companys key personnel could adversely affect its business. The Companys future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees.  The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Companys future operating results because of such employees experience and knowledge of the Companys business and customer relationships.  If key employees depart, the Company may have to incur significant costs to replace them, and the Companys ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner.  The Company does not expect to maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel. The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships. The Company is involved in the SSAT joint venture, and may initiate future joint venture projects.  A joint venture involves certain risks such as: ·                  The Company may not have voting control over the joint venture;·                  The Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its joint venture partner;·                  The joint venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Companys;·                  The joint venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company;·                  The joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture and the Company;·                  The joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; and·                  The joint venture partner could become bankrupt requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture. In addition, the Company relies on the SSAT joint venture for its stevedoring services on the West Coast of the U.S. market. The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market. Matsons China, Micronesia and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include: ·                  Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies;·                  Challenges in working with and maintaining good relationships with joint venture partners in our foreign operations;·                  Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;·                  U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials;·                  Global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates;·                  Competition with established and new carriers; 10Table of Contents ·                  Currency exchange rate fluctuations;·                  Political and economic instability;·                  Protectionist measures that may affect the Companys operation of its wholly-owned foreign enterprise; and·                  Challenges caused by cultural differences. Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Companys logistics segment is dependent upon third parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate the Companys logistics business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third party services, its business could be adversely affected. The Companys logistics segment is dependent upon rail, truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third parties.  If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third parties at reasonable rates to meet its customers needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third parties on a temporary or permanent basis.  As a result, the Companys business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event. The Companys vessel and terminal operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap.  Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations.  As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Companys business. The Companys growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Companys capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities.  The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures.  The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.  The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The Companys Shipbuilding Agreements with Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, Inc. are subject to risks. On November 6, 2013, MatNav and APSI entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which APSI will construct two new 3,600-TEU Aloha-class dual-fuel capable containerships, with expected delivery dates during the third and fourth quarters of 2018.  Failure of either party to the shipbuilding agreement to fulfill its obligations under the agreement could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Companys operations and profitability. War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting Hawaiis economy and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets.  Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Companys shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matsons vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations. 11Table of Contents The effects of the Companys Separation from Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. may expose us or our shareholders to significant liabilities, or prevent us from undertaking certain desirable transactions during the two-year period following the Separation. The Company and A&B entered into a number of agreements in connection with the Separation that set forth certain rights and obligations of the parties post-Separation, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement, a Tax Sharing Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement and a Transition Services Agreement.  The Company possesses certain rights under those agreements, including indemnification rights from certain liabilities allocated to A&B.  The failure of A&B to perform its obligations under the Separation-related agreements could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, the Company received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as well as an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (which opinion relies on the effectiveness of the IRS ruling), substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Separation and the distribution of shares, taken together, will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.  If there is a determination that the Separation and the distribution is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, A&B, and their respective investors could become subject to significant tax and other liabilities and costs.  In addition, in order to preserve the tax free nature of the Separation, the parties have agreed not to issue equity securities representing 50 percent or more of their equity interests, acquire businesses or assets by issuing securities representing 50 percent or more of their equity interests or become parties to mergers or asset transfers that could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Separation, in each case, during the two-year period following the Separation. Risks Relating to Financial Matters A deterioration of the Companys credit profile or disruptions of the credit markets could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. Deterioration in the Companys credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Companys credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, the Companys credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Companys credit profile deteriorates.  Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates.  Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Companys cash flow and results of operations. Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Companys credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Companys business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company. The Companys credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include the maintenance of minimum shareholders equity levels, a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and the maintenance of no more than a maximum amount of priority debt as a percentage of consolidated tangible assets.  If the Company does not maintain the required covenants, and that breach of covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in default, the Companys access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.  The Companys continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants. The Companys effective income tax rate may vary. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on the Companys effective income tax rate and, therefore, the Companys net income and earnings per share.  These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in 12Table of Contents interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the Companys evaluation of collectability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of CCF deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; acquisitions and changes in the Companys corporate structure.  These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect the Companys cash flow and results of operations. Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Companys financial performance. The amount of the Companys employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations.  Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Companys operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.  In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Companys single-employer and multiemployer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions.  There can be no assurance that it will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Companys businesses. The Company may have exposure under its multiemployer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Companys employees. The Company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans.  In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plans unfunded vested benefits.  Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations.  If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member in its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plans unfunded vested benefits.  In addition, if a multiemployer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the IRS will impose certain penalties and taxes. Risks Relating to Legal and Legislative Matters The impact of the molasses release in September 2013 may have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company could be faced with regulatory compliance obligations, third party or governmental agency claims, disputes, legal or other proceedings, fines, penalties, natural resource damages, inquiries or investigations or other regulatory actions, including debarment, in connection with the release of molasses into Honolulu Harbor in September 2013.  The Company cannot currently estimate the potential impact of any such events, but such events could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matsons tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  See Legal Proceedings below. The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, that could have an adverse effect on the Company. The nature of the Companys business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC.  For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and 13Table of Contents practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matsons tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.  For a description of significant legal proceedings involving the Company, see Legal Proceedings below. Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii market with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels, the Companys business would be adversely affected.  In addition, the Companys advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act.  If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Noncompliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Companys business. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including cabotage laws, government rate regulations, and environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, including, but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act.  Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Companys business.  Noncompliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Companys business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.  Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company.  Climate change legislation, such as limiting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a cap and trade system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may have an adverse effect on the Companys business. Risks Related to Capital Structure The Companys business could be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Companys articles of incorporation protect the Companys ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Although the Company believes it currently is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, if non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Companys common stock, the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  Such an event could result in the Companys ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, which could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operation. 14Table of Contents "
3,MATX,MATSON INC,2013-03-01,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS Matsons business faces the risks set forth below, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Companys behalf are qualified by the risks described below. Risks Relating To Operations Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions that result in a further decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Companys services and products in Hawaii, the U.S. Mainland, Guam, Asia or South Pacific may adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows. A continuation or further weakening of the U.S., Guam, Asian, South Pacific or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and freight rates. Within the U.S., a further weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth, and employment, or the further weakening of consumer confidence, market demand or the economy in the U.S. Mainland, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Hawaii and Asia, travel to Hawaii and domestic transportation of goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates.  In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets or a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates may adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Companys China service. In addition, the Company could be impacted by the possible impact of cuts to federal programs, including Defense Department programs, as result of a federal sequestration scheduled to take place in March, 2013.  The Budget Control Act could impose an estimated $1.2 trillion in future federal spending cuts if budget deficit targets are not achieved. While Congress is discussing various options to prevent or defer sequestration, we cannot predict whether any such efforts will succeed. The impact of sequestration on our carriage of military cargo is unknown; however, it is possible that a funding delay could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may face new or increased competition. The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Companys markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of ships or capacity by existing competition on any of the Companys routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes and rates. One current competitor, Pasha Hawaii Transport Lines, announced that it intends to place a second ship into its Hawaii service as early as 2014.  The extent of this market entry, in terms of sailing frequency, service reliability, slot availability, cargo configuration and service differentiation, is unknown.  However, there may be a period of competitive disruption impacting rates and volumes following this market entry that would impact all carriers in the Hawaii trade, including Matson. The loss of or damage to key vendor, agent and customer relationships may adversely affect the Companys business. The Companys businesses are dependent on their relationships with key vendors, agents and customers, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Companys largest customers. The Companys business relies on its relationships with the military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers. Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Companys intermodal business. For 2012, the Companys ocean transportation business ten largest customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of the business revenue.  For 2012, the Companys logistics business ten largest customers accounted for approximately 26 percent of the business revenue. The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Companys business and revenue. 9Table of Contents An increase in fuel prices, or changes in the Companys ability to collect fuel surcharges, may adversely affect the Companys profits. Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Companys ocean transportation business.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Companys control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Companys results of operations based on market and competitive conditions. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to other expense increases, through, for example, increased costs of energy and purchased transportation services.  In the Companys ocean transportation and logistics services segments, the Company is able to utilize fuel surcharges to partially recover increases in fuel expense, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Companys competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense. Changes in the Companys ability to collect fuel surcharges may adversely affect its results of operations. Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of the Company or other companies in related industries may adversely affect the Companys operations. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately 1,068 regular full-time employees, of which approximately 23 percent were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. The Company could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices. Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of the Company or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully. The Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters. The Companys operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes.

Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available. Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance. The Companys significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Companys future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 10Table of Contents Interruption or failure of the Companys information technology and communications systems could impair the Companys ability to operate and adversely affect its business. The Company is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems. All information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions.  The Company may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at the Companys facilities. Any failure of the Companys systems could result in interruptions in its service or production, reductions in its revenue and profits and damage to its reputation. Loss of the Companys key personnel could adversely affect its business. The Companys future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees.

If key employees depart, the Company may have to incur significant costs to replace them, and the Companys ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner. The Company does not expect to maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel. The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships. The Company is involved in the SSAT joint venture, and may initiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain risks such as: ·      the Company may not have voting control over the joint venture;·      the Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its venture partners;·      the venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Companys;·      the venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations, or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company;·      the joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; and·      the venture partner could become bankrupt, requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture. In addition, the Company relies on the SSAT joint venture for its stevedoring services on the West Coast of the U.S. market. The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market. Matsons China, Micronesia and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include: ·      challenges in operating in foreign countries and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies;·      difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;·      U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials;·      global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates;·      competition with established and new carriers;·      currency exchange rate fluctuations;·      political and economic instability;·      protectionist measures that may affect the Companys operation of its wholly-owned foreign enterprise; and·      challenges caused by cultural differences. Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Companys operating results. 11Table of Contents The Companys logistics segment is dependent upon third parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate the Companys logistics business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third party services, its business could be adversely affected. The Companys logistics segment is dependent upon rail, truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third parties. If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third parties at a reasonable rate to meet its customers needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third parties on a temporary or permanent basis. As a result, the Companys business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event. The Companys vessel operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil spill, or other environmental mishap. Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations. As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Companys business. The Companys growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Companys capital and its managements attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Companys operations and profitability. War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting Hawaiis economy and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase the volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets. Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Companys shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matsons vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations. The Separation may expose us or our shareholders to significant liabilities, or prevent us from undertaking certain desirable transactions. The Company and A&B entered into a number of agreements in connection with the Separation that set forth certain rights and obligations of the parties post-Separation, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement, a Tax Sharing Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement and a Transition Services Agreement. The Company possesses certain rights under those agreements, including indemnification rights from certain liabilities allocated to A&B. The failure of A&B to perform its obligations under the Separation related agreements could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, the Company received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as well as an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (which opinion relies on the effectiveness of the IRS ruling), substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Separation and the distribution of shares, taken together, will qualify as a 12Table of Contents reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. If there is a determination that the Separation and the distribution is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, A&B, and their respective investors could become subject to significant tax and other liabilities and costs.  In addition, in order to preserve the tax free nature of the Separation, the parties have agreed not to issue equity securities representing 50 percent or more of their equity interests, acquire businesses or assets by issuing securities representing 50 percent or more of their equity interests or become parties to mergers or asset transfers that could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Separation. Risks Relating to Financial Matters A deterioration of the Companys credit profile or disruptions of the credit markets could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. Deterioration in the Companys credit profile may ultimately have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Companys credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the Companys credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Companys credit profile deteriorates. Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates. Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Companys cash flow and results of operations. Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Companys credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Companys business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company. The Companys credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include the maintenance of minimum shareholders equity levels, a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, depreciation, amortization, and taxes, and the maintenance of no more than a maximum amount of priority debt as a percentage of consolidated tangible assets. If the Company does not maintain the required covenants, and that breach of covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in default, the Companys access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable. The Companys continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants. Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Companys financial performance. The amount of the Companys employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Companys operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Companys single-employer and multiemployer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions. Although the Company has frozen the pension plan and actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Companys businesses. 13Table of Contents The Company may have exposure under its multiemployer pension and postretirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Companys employees. The Company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans. In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plans unfunded vested benefits. Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations. If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member in its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plans unfunded vested benefits. In addition, if a multiemployer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes. Risks Relating to Legal and Legislative Matters The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, that could have an adverse effect on the Company. The nature of the Companys business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental matters, and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC. For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings.  If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matsons tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.  For a description of significant legal proceedings involving the Company, see Legal Proceedings below. Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application could have an adverse effect on the Companys business. If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels were to enter the Hawaii market, the Companys business would be adversely affected. In addition, the Companys advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Noncompliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Companys business. The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including cabotage laws, government rate regulations, and environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, including, but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act. Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Companys business. Noncompliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Companys business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that 14Table of Contents restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not all be able to be recovered through increased payments from customers.  Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company. Climate change legislation, such as limiting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a cap and trade system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may have an adverse effect on the Companys business. Risks Related to Capital Structure The Companys business could be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Companys articles of incorporation protect the Companys ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Although the Company believes it currently is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, if non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Companys common stock, the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Such an event could result in the Companys ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, which could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operation. The Company has a shareholder rights plan, or poison pill, which could affect the price of its common stock and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire the Company. On June 8, 2012, the Companys board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The poison pill may discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, or acquiring us through an acquisition, merger, or similar transaction. Such an acquirer could be prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if the Companys shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. "
16,MATX,MATSON INC,2012-02-28,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The business of A&B and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) faces numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in the Company’s filings with the SEC.  The risks described below are not the only risks that the Company faces, nor are they listed in order of significance.  Other risks and uncertainties may also impair its business operations.  Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf are qualified by the risks described below.Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions that result in a further decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Company’s services and products in Hawaii, the U.S. Mainland, Guam or Asia may adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows.A continuation or further weakening of the U.S., Guam, Asian or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes, freight rates, and real estate leasing, sales and development activity. Within the U.S., a continuation or further weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth, and employment, or the further weakening of consumer confidence, market demand or the economy in the U.S. Mainland, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Hawaii and Asia, travel to Hawaii and domestic transportation of goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates, the sale of Hawaii real estate, and the real estate leasing and development markets. In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets or a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates may adversely affect freight volumes or rates in the Company’s China service.The Company may face new or increased competition.The Company’s transportation segment may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company’s markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of ships or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes or rates.  See also discussion under “Business and Properties - Transportation - Competition” above.For the Company’s real estate segments, there are numerous other developers, managers and owners of commercial and residential real estate and undeveloped land that compete or may compete with the Company for management and leasing revenues, land for development, properties for acquisition and disposition, and for tenants and purchasers for properties.  Increased vacancies, decreased rents, sales prices or sales volume, or lack of development opportunities may lead to a deterioration in results from the Company’s real estate business.The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.The reduction in availability of mortgage financing and the volatility and reduction in liquidity in the financial markets may adversely affect the Company’s real estate business.During 2008 and 2009, the financial industry experienced significant instability due to, among other things, declining property values and increasing defaults on loans. This led to tightened credit requirements, reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for virtually all borrowers. Fewer loan products, tighter loan qualifications and higher interest rates make it more difficult for borrowers to finance the purchase of units in the Company’s projects. Tightening of credit in the commercial markets may adversely affect the Company’s ability to secure construction or other financing on acceptable or favorable terms for the Company’s residential and commercial projects, working capital requirements, or investment needs. Additionally, the stringent requirements to obtain financing for buyers of commercial properties make it significantly more difficult for the Company to sell commercial properties and may negatively impact the sales prices and other terms of such sales. The stringent credit environment may also impact the Company in other ways, including the credit or solvency of customers, vendors, or joint venture partners, and the ability of partners to fund their equity obligations to the joint venture.A deterioration of the Company’s credit profile or disruptions of the credit markets could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.A deterioration in the Company’s credit profile may ultimately have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs.  If the Company’s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s credit profile deteriorates. Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates. Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and results of operations.Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity levels, a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, depreciation, amortization, and taxes, and the maintenance of a minimum unencumbered property investment value. If the Company does not maintain the required covenants, and that breach of covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable. Additionally, the Company’s credit facilities contain other terms limiting its ability to incur additional indebtedness, including restrictions on total debt outstanding and restrictions on secured debt outstanding. The Company’s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.An increase in fuel prices, or changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges, may adversely affect the Company’s profits.Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company’s shipping and agribusiness operations.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations based on market and competitive conditions. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to other expense increases, through, for example, increased costs of energy, petroleum-based raw materials and purchased transportation services.  In the Company’s ocean transportation and logistics services segments, the Company is able to utilize fuel surcharges to partially recover increases in fuel expense, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense. Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges may adversely affect its results of operations. Increases in energy costs for the Company’s leased real estate portfolio are typically recovered from lessees, although the Company’s share of energy costs increases as a result of lower occupancies and higher operating cost reimbursements impact the ability to increase underlying rents. Rising fuel prices also may increase the cost of construction, including delivery costs to Hawaii, and the cost of materials that are petroleum-based, thus affecting the Company’s development projects. Finally, rising fuel prices will impact the cost of producing and transporting sugar.      Noncompliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including government rate regulations, land use regulations, government administration of the U.S. sugar program, environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, and cabotage laws. Noncompliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Company’s business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the shipping business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not all be able to be recovered through increased payments from customers.  The real estate segments are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, which, if changed, may adversely affect the Company’s business. The agribusiness segment is subject to the federal government’s administration of the U.S. sugar program, such as the 2008 Farm Bill, and the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission’s regulation of avoided energy cost rates paid to the Company in connection with it sale of electric power. Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company. Climate change legislation, such as limiting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of the Company or other companies in related industries may adversely affect the Company’s operations.As of December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately 2,100 regular full-time employees, of which approximately 48 percent were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. The Company’s transportation, real estate and agribusiness segments may be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices. Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of the Company or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.  For example, in its real estate sales segment, the Company may be unable to complete construction of its projects if building materials or labor is unavailable due to labor disruptions in the relevant trade groups.The loss of or damage to key vendor, agent and customer relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company’s business is dependent on its relationships with key vendors, agents, customers and tenants. The ocean transportation business relies on its relationships with freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers. Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Company’s intermodal business. For agribusiness, HC&S’s relationship with C&H Sugar Company, Inc. is critical. The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may affect the Company’s business adversely.Interruption or failure of the Company’s information technology and communications systems could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.The Company is highly dependent on information technology systems. For example, in the ocean transportation segment, these dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems. All information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions.  The Company may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, or other unanticipated problems at the Company’s facilities. Any failure of the Company’s systems could result in interruptions in its service or production, reductions in its revenue and profits and damage to its reputation.      The Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters.The Company’s transportation operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes. Such events will interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.For the real estate segments, the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires, tornados and unusually heavy or prolonged rain, could damage its real estate holdings, resulting in substantial repair or replacement costs to the extent not covered by insurance, a reduction in property values, or a loss of revenue, and could have an adverse effect on its ability to develop, lease and sell properties. The occurrence of natural disasters could also cause increases in property insurance rates and deductibles, which could reduce demand for, or increase the cost of owning or developing, the Company’s properties.For the Agribusiness segment, drought, greater than normal rainfall, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires, other natural disasters or agricultural pestilence may have an adverse effect on the sugar planting, harvesting and production, electricity generation and sales, and the Agribusiness segment’s facilities, including dams and reservoirs. The Company maintains casualty insurance under policies it believes to be adequate and appropriate. These policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles. Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, Matson business interruption, physical damage to dams, pollution stemming from non-marine operations  or crop  damage , generally are not insured. In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance  coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk. Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available. Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance. Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability.War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting Hawaii’s economy and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase the volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets. Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company’s shipping operations or real estate holdings, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures are likely to slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.Loss of the Company’s key personnel could adversely affect its business.The Company’s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees. The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect its future operating results because of such employee’s experience and knowledge of its business and customer relationships. If key employees depart, the Company may have to incur significant costs to replace them, and the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner. The Company does not expect to maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.      The Company is involved in joint ventures and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.The Company is involved in joint venture relationships, and may initiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain risks such as:  •the Company may not have voting control over the joint venture;  •the Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its venture partners;  •the venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Company’s;  •the venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations and development activities, or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company;  •the joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; and  •the venture partner could become bankrupt, requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture.In connection with its real estate joint ventures, the Company is sometimes asked to guarantee completion of a joint venture’s construction and development of a project, or to indemnify a third party serving as surety for a joint venture’s bonds for such completion. If the Company were to become obligated to perform under such arrangement, the Company may be adversely affected.The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, that could have an adverse effect on the Company.The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental matters, construction litigation, and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC. For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings. These disputes, individually or collectively, could harm the Company’s business by distracting its management from the operation of its business. If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.  As a real estate developer, the Company may face warranty and construction defect claims, as described below in the “Real Estate” section of this “Risk Factors
” item.  For a description of significant legal proceedings involving the Company, see “Legal Proceedings” below.Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.The amount of the Company’s employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multiemployer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses. The Company may have exposure under its multiemployer plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees.The Company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans. In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits. Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations. In the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member in its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits. In addition, if a multiemployer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes.The Company’s proposed separation into two independent, publicly-traded companies (one company comprising the Company’s real estate and agriculture businesses and the other comprising the Company’s transportation business) is subject to risks inherent to a large-scale transaction.The proposed separation of the Company into two independent, publicly-traded companies is subject to multiple risks and uncertainties, including the risk that the separation will not be consummated, the risk that financing transactions contemplated as part of the separation cannot be consummated on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company, and the risk that the transaction does not qualify for tax-free treatment under applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code.  If the separation is consummated, it is possible that, due to unforeseen changes in market and economic conditions or other events, the two resulting companies may not achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected from separation or that such benefits may be delayed.  As a result, the aggregate market price of the common stock of the two resulting companies could be less than the market price of the Company’s common stock if the separation had not occurred.TRANSPORTATIONThe Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market.The Company, through Matson’s China service, is subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:  •challenges in operating in a foreign country and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies;  •difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  •U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials;  •global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates;  •competition with established and new shippers;  •currency exchange rate fluctuations;  •political and economic instability;  •protectionist measures that may affect the Company’s operation of its wholly-owned foreign enterprise; and  •challenges caused by cultural differences.Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s operating results.Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company’s vessel operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act. Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event.  The Company’s vessel operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil spill, or other environmental mishap. Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations. As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s logistics services are dependent upon third parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate the Company’s logistics business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third party services, its business could be adversely affected.The Company’s logistics services are dependent upon rail, truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third parties. If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third parties at a reasonable rate to meet its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third parties on a temporary or permanent basis. As a result, the Company’s business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.The loss of several of the Company’s major customers could have an adverse effect on the revenue and business of the Company’s logistics business.The Company’s logistics business derives a significant portion of its revenues from its largest customers. For 2011, the Company’s logistics business’ largest ten customers accounted for approximately 25 percent of the business’ revenue. A reduction in or termination of the Company’s logistics services by several of the logistics business’ largest customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenue and business.Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels were to enter any of the Company’s Jones Act markets, the Company’s business would be adversely affected. In addition, the Company’s advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of maritime cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels.The Company’s business could be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.Although the Company believes it currently is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, the Company does not have restrictions in place that protect its ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.  As a result, non-U.S. citizens could intentionally or inadvertently own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company’s common stock, and the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Such an event could result in the Company’s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade, the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, and the inability to register its vessels in the United States, each of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operation.REAL ESTATEThe Company is subject to risks associated with real estate construction and development.The Company’s development projects are subject to risks relating to the Company’s ability to complete its projects on time and on budget. Factors that may result in a development project exceeding budget or being prevented from completion include:  •an inability of the Company or buyers to secure sufficient financing or insurance on favorable terms, or at all;  •construction delays, defects, or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs;  •an increase in commodity or construction costs, including labor costs;  •the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues;  •an inability to obtain, or significant delay in obtaining, zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations;  •difficulty in complying with local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities, affordable housing, and water quality as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats;  •an inability to have access to sufficient and reliable sources of water or to secure water service or meters for its projects;  •an inability to secure tenants necessary to support the project or maintain compliance with debt covenants;  •failure to achieve or sustain anticipated occupancy or sales levels;  •buyer defaults, including defaults under executed or binding contracts;  •condemnation of all or parts of development or operating properties, which could adversely affect the value or viability of such projects; and  •an inability to sell the Company’s constructed inventory.Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s operating results.A decline in leasing rental income could adversely affect the Company.The Company owns a portfolio of commercial income properties.  Factors that may adversely affect the portfolio’s profitability include:  •a significant number of the Company’s tenants are unable to meet their obligations;  •increases in non-recoverable operating and ownership costs;  •the Company is unable to lease space at its properties when the space becomes available;  •the rental rates upon a renewal or a new lease are significantly lower than prior rents or do not increase sufficiently to cover increases in operating and ownership costs;  •the providing of lease concessions, such as free or discounted rents and tenant improvement allowances; and  •the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues at the property.The bankruptcy of key tenants may adversely affect the Company’s revenues and profitability.The Company may derive significant revenues and earnings from certain key tenants. If one or more of these tenants declare bankruptcy or voluntarily vacates from the leased premise and the Company is unable to re-lease such space or to re-lease it on comparable or more favorable terms, the Company’s liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. Additionally, the Company’s results of operations may be further adversely impacted by an impairment or “write-down” of intangible assets, such as lease-in-place value or a deferred asset related to straight-line lease rent, associated with a tenant bankruptcy or voluntary vacancy.Governmental entities have adopted or may adopt regulatory requirements that may restrict the Company’s development activity.The Company is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the land development process, including laws and regulations related to zoning and permitted land uses.  Government entities have adopted or may approve regulations or laws that could negatively impact the availability of land and development opportunities within those areas.  For example, in December 2007, Maui County adopted an ordinance requiring verification of water source availability and sustainability for all developments prior to submission of subdivision construction plans.  This requirement adds further process delays and burdens the developer with identifying and developing new water sources.  It is possible that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers in the future that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to develop projects in the affected markets or could require that the Company satisfy additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could delay development progress or increase the development costs of the Company.  Any such delays or costs could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and earnings.Real estate development projects are subject to warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.As a developer, the Company is subject to warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The amounts payable under these claims, both in legal fees and remedying any construction defects, can be significant and exceed the profits made from the project. As a consequence, the Company may maintain liability insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from contractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials, and create warranty and other reserves for projects based on historical experience and qualitative risks associated with the type of project built. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, the Company cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage, contractor arrangements and reserves will be adequate to address some or all of the Company’s warranty and construction defect claims in the future. For example, contractual indemnities may be difficult to enforce, the Company may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions, and certain claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered and the availability of liability insurance for construction defects could be limited or costly. Accordingly, the Company cannot provide any assurance that such coverage will be adequate or available at all, or available at an acceptable cost.The Company’s real estate investments are relatively illiquid.The Company’s investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which may limit the Company’s ability to strategically reposition its portfolio in the near-term as a response to changes in economic, financial, investment or other conditions, or may prevent or delay the Company’s efforts to generate cash from these sales. The Company cannot predict whether it will be able to sell any property or investment at the price or on the terms set by the Company or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to the Company.The Company’s financial results are significantly influenced by the economic growth and strength of Hawaii.The vast majority of the Company’s real estate development activity is conducted in Hawaii. Consequently, the growth and strength of Hawaii’s economy has a significant impact on the demand for the Company’s real estate development projects. As a result, any adverse change to the growth or health of Hawaii’s economy could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.      The value of the Company’s development projects and its commercial properties are affected by a number of factors.Weakness in the real estate sector, difficulty in obtaining or renewing project-level financing, and changes in the Company’s investment and development strategy, among other factors, may affect the value of commercial properties or the feasibility of certain development projects owned by the Company or by its joint ventures. If the fair value of the Company’s development projects or the undiscounted cash flows of its commercial properties were to decline below the carrying value of those assets, the Company would be required to recognize an impairment loss, which would have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.AGRIBUSINESSThe lack of water for agricultural irrigation could adversely affect the Company.It is crucial for the Company’s Agribusiness segment to have access to reliable sources of water for the irrigation of sugar cane. As further described in “Legal Proceedings” below, there are challenges to the Company’s ability to divert water from streams in Maui. In addition, the Company’s access to water is subject to weather patterns that cannot be reliably predicted.  If the Company is not permitted to divert stream waters for its use or there is insufficient rainfall, it would have an adverse effect on the Company’s sugar operations, including possible cessation of operations.A decline in raw sugar prices will adversely affect the Company’s business.The business and results of operations of the Company’s agribusiness segment are substantially affected by market factors, particularly the domestic prices for raw cane sugar. These market factors are influenced by a variety of forces, including prices of competing crops and suppliers, weather conditions, and United States farm and trade policies. If the price for sugar were to decline, the Company’s Agribusiness segment would be adversely affected. See also discussion under “Business and Properties - Agribusiness - Competition and Sugar Legislation” above.The Company is subject to risks associated with raw sugar production.The Company’s production of raw sugar is subject to numerous risks that could adversely affect the volume and quality of sugar produced, including:  •weather and natural disasters;  •disease;  •weed control;  •uncontrolled fires, including arson;  •government restrictions on farming practices due to cane burning;  •increases in costs, including, but not limited to fuel, fertilizer, herbicide, and drip tubing;  •water availability (see risk factor above regarding lack of water);  •equipment failures in factory or power plant;  •labor, including labor availability (see risk factor above regarding labor disruptions) and loss of qualified personnel; and  •lack of demand for the Company’s production.Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s future Agribusiness operating results.      A reorganization or termination of the Company’s sugar business could result in impairment losses and restructuring costs.If the Company’s sugar business is unable to sustain profitability, the Company may reorganize or terminate its sugar operations. The reorganization or termination of sugar operations may result in an impairment loss and restructuring costs that would adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.The Company’s power sales contracts could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.The Company’s power sales contracts, as described under “Business and Properties – Energy” above, expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, which could adversely affect the Company’s Agribusiness operations.The foregoing should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company or on its behalf.The market for power sales in Hawaii is limited.The power distribution systems in Hawaii are small and island-specific; currently, there is no ability to move power generated on one island to any other island.  In addition, Hawaii law limits the ability of independent power producers, such as the Company’s Agribusiness operations, to sell its output to firms other than the local utilities on each island.  Further, any sales of electricity by the Company to the utilities on each island must be done under long term agreements subject to the approval of the State Public Utilities Commission.  Unlike some areas in the Mainland, Hawaii’s independent power producers have no ability to use utility infrastructure to transfer power to other locations"
12,MATX,MATSON INC,2011-02-25,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The business of A&B and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) faces numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in the Company’s filings with the SEC.  The risks described below are not the only risks that the Company faces, nor are they listed in order of significance.  Other risks and uncertainties may also impair its business operations.  Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company’s behalf are qualified by the risks described below.Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions that result in a further decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Company’s services and products in Hawaii, the U.S. Mainland, Guam or Asia may adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows.A continuation or further weakening of the U.S., Guam, Asian or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes, freight rates, and real estate leasing, sales and development activity. Within the U.S., a continuation or further weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth, and employment, or the further weakening of consumer confidence, market demand or the economy in the U.S. Mainland, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Hawaii and Asia, travel to Hawaii and domestic transportation of goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates, the sale of Hawaii real estate, and the real estate leasing and development markets. In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets may adversely affect freight volumes or rates in the Company’s China service. Additionally, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates may cause these adverse effects as well.The Company may face new or increased competition.The Company’s transportation segment may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company’s markets.  The entry of a new competitor or the addition of ships or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company’s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes or rates.  See also discussion under “Business and Properties - Transportation - Competition” above.For the Company’s real estate segments, there are numerous other developers, managers and owners of commercial and residential real estate and undeveloped land that compete or may compete with the Company for management and leasing revenues, land for development, properties for acquisition and disposition, and for tenants and purchasers for properties.  Increased vacancies, decreased rents, sales prices or sales volume, or lack of development opportunities may lead to a deterioration in results from the Company’s real estate business.The Company’s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.The reduction in availability of mortgage financing and the volatility and reduction in liquidity in the financial markets may adversely affect the Company’s real estate business.During 2008 and 2009, the financial industry experienced significant instability due to, among other things, declining property values and increasing defaults on loans. This led to tightened credit requirements, reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for virtually all borrowers. Fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications make it more difficult for borrowers to finance the purchase of units in the Company’s projects. Tightening of credit in the commercial markets may adversely affect the Company’s ability to secure construction or other financing on acceptable or favorable terms for the Company’s residential and commercial projects, working capital requirements, or investment needs. Additionally, the stringent requirements to obtain financing for buyers of commercial properties make it significantly more difficult for the Company to sell commercial properties and may negatively impact the sales prices and other terms of such sales. The stringent credit environment may also impact the Company in other ways, including the credit or solvency of customers, vendors, or joint venture partners, and the ability of partners to fund their equity obligations to the joint venture.A future downgrade in the Company’s credit rating or disruptions on the credit markets could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.In January 2011, Standard and Poor’s issued a research update that indicated a continuation of the Company’s BBB+ rating with a Negative outlook. Further changes in the Company’s credit ratings may ultimately have an adverse impact on the Company’s ability to access debt in the private or public market and also may increase its borrowing costs. If the Company’s credit ratings fall below investment grade, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation), could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the Company’s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company’s ratings are downgraded, and renegotiation of the Company’s primary revolving credit line upon its expiration in 2011 could be negatively affected by ratings downgrades.Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company’s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company’s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.The Company’s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include the maintenance of minimum shareholders’ equity levels, a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, depreciation, amortization, and taxes, and the maintenance of a minimum unencumbered property investment value. If the Company does not maintain the required covenants, and that breach of covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in default, the Company’s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable.An increase in fuel prices, or changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges, may adversely affect the Company’s profits.Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company’s shipping and agribusiness operations.  The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company’s control.  Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations based on market and competitive conditions. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to other expense increases, through, for example, increased costs of energy, petroleum-based raw materials and purchased transportation services.  In the Company’s ocean transportation and logistics services segments, the Company is able to utilize fuel surcharges to partially recover increases in fuel expense, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Company’s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense. Changes in the Company’s ability to collect fuel surcharges may adversely affect its results of operations. Increases in energy costs for the Company’s leased real estate portfolio are typically recovered from lessees, although the Company’s share of energy costs increases as a result of lower occupancies and higher operating cost reimbursements impact the ability to increase underlying rents. Rising fuel prices also may increase the cost of construction, including delivery costs to Hawaii, and the cost of materials that are petroleum-based, thus affecting the Company’s development projects. Finally, rising fuel prices will impact the cost of producing and transporting sugar.Noncompliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including government rate regulations, land use regulations, government administration of the U.S. sugar program, environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, and cabotage laws. Noncompliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Company’s business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. For example, if the Jones Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder were repealed, amended, or otherwise modified, non-U.S. competitors with significantly lower costs may consequently enter any of the Jones Act routes or the Company’s business may be significantly altered, all of which may have an adverse effect on the Company’s shipping business. In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the shipping business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not all be able to be recovered through increased payments from customers.  The real estate segments are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, which, if changed, may adversely affect the Company’s business. The agribusiness segment is subject to the federal government’s administration of the U.S. sugar program, such as the 2008 Farm Bill, and the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission’s regulation of avoided energy cost rates paid to the Company in connection with it sale of electric power. Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company. Climate change legislation, such as limiting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of the Company or other companies in related industries may adversely affect the Company’s operations.As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately 2,300 regular full-time employees, of which approximately 45 percent were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. The Company’s transportation, real estate and agribusiness segments may be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices. Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure of the Company or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.  For example, in its real estate sales segment, the Company may be unable to complete construction of its projects if building materials or labor is unavailable due to labor disruptions in the relevant trade groups.The loss of or damage to key vendor and customer relationships may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company’s business is dependent on its relationships with key vendors, customers and tenants. The ocean transportation business relies on its relationships with freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers. Relationships with railroads and shipping companies are important in the Company’s intermodal business. For agribusiness, HC&S’s relationship with C&H Sugar Company, Inc. is critical. The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may affect the Company’s business adversely.Interruption or failure of the Company’s information technology and communications systems could impair the Company’s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.The Company is highly dependent on information technology systems. For example, in the ocean transportation segment, these dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems. All information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions.  The Company may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, or other unanticipated problems at the Company’s facilities. Any failure of the Company’s systems could result in interruptions in its service or production, reductions in its revenue and profits and damage to its reputation.The Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters.The Company’s transportation operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes. Such events will interfere with the Company’s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.  In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company’s terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.For the real estate segments, the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires, tornados and unusually heavy or prolonged rain, could damage its real estate holdings, resulting in substantial repair or replacement costs to the extent not covered by insurance, a reduction in property values, or a loss of revenue, and could have an adverse effect on its ability to develop, lease and sell properties. The occurrence of natural disasters could also cause increases in property insurance rates and deductibles, which could reduce demand for, or increase the cost of owning or developing, the Company’s properties.For the Agribusiness segment, drought, greater than normal rainfall, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires, other natural disasters or agricultural pestilence may have an adverse effect on the sugar and coffee planting, harvesting and production, and the Agribusiness segment’s facilities, including dams and reservoirs.Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company’s operations and profitability.War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting Hawaii’s economy and the Company.  Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase the volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets. Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company’s shipping operations or real estate holdings, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson’s vessels for military operation.  Heightened security measures are likely to slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.Loss of the Company’s key personnel could adversely affect its business.The Company’s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees. The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect its future operating results because of such employee’s experience and knowledge of its business and customer relationships. If key employees depart, the Company may have to incur significant costs to replace them, and the Company’s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner. The Company does not expect to maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.The Company is involved in joint ventures and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.The Company is involved in joint venture relationships, and may initiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain risks such as:  •the Company may not have voting control over the joint venture;  •the Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its venture partners;  •the venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Company’s;  •the venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations and development activities, or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company;  •the joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; and  •the venture partner could become insolvent, requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project.In connection with its real estate joint ventures, the Company is sometimes asked to guarantee completion of a joint venture’s construction and development of a project, or to indemnify a third party serving as surety for a joint venture’s bonds for such completion. If the Company were to become obligated to perform under such arrangement, the Company may be adversely affected. The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, that could have an adverse effect on the Company.The nature of the Company’s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental matters, construction litigation, and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC. For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings. These disputes, individually or collectively, could harm the Company’s business by distracting its management from the operation of its business. If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson’s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.  As a real estate developer, the Company may face warranty and construction defect claims, as described below in the “Real Estate” section of this “Risk Factors
” item.  For a description of significant legal proceedings involving the Company, see “Legal Proceedings” below.Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.The amount of the Company’s employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company’s single-employer and multiemployer pension plans and plan funding.  These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company’s businesses. The Company may have exposure under its multiemployer plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company’s employees.The Company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans. In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits. Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations. In the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member in its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan’s unfunded vested benefits. In addition, if a multiemployer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes.TRANSPORTATIONThe Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market.The Company, through Matson’s China service, is subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:  •challenges in operating in a foreign country and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies;  •difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  •U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials;  •global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates;  •competition with established and new shippers;  •currency exchange rate fluctuations;  •political and economic instability;  •protectionist measures that may affect the Company’s operation of its wholly-owned foreign enterprise; and  •challenges caused by cultural differences.Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s operating results.Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company’s vessel operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act. Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event. The Company’s vessel operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil spill, or other environmental mishap. Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations. As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.The Company’s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company’s capital and its management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s logistics services are dependent upon third parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate the Company’s logistics business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third party services, its business could be adversely affected.The Company’s logistics services are dependent upon rail, truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third parties. If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third parties at a reasonable rate to meet its customers’ needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third parties on a temporary or permanent basis. As a result, the Company’s business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.The loss of several of the Company’s major customers could have an adverse effect on the revenue and business of the Company’s logistics business.The Company’s logistics business derives a significant portion of its revenues from its largest customers. For 2010, the Company’s logistics business’ largest ten customers accounted for approximately 29 percent of the business’ revenue. A reduction in or termination of the Company’s logistics services by several of the logistics business’ largest customers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenue and business.      REAL ESTATEThe Company is subject to risks associated with real estate construction and development.The Company’s development projects are subject to risks relating to the Company’s ability to complete its projects on time and on budget. Factors that may result in a development project exceeding budget or being prevented from completion include:  •an inability of the Company or buyers to secure sufficient financing or insurance on favorable terms, or at all;  •construction delays, defects, or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs;  •an increase in commodity or construction costs, including labor costs;  •the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues;  •an inability to obtain, or significant delay in obtaining, zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations;  •difficulty in complying with local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities, affordable housing, and water quality as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats;  •an inability to have access to sufficient and reliable sources of water or to secure water service or meters for its projects;  •an inability to secure tenants necessary to support the project or maintain compliance with debt covenants;  •failure to achieve or sustain anticipated occupancy or sales levels;  •buyer defaults, including defaults under executed or binding contracts; and  •an inability to sell the Company’s constructed inventory.Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s operating results.A decline in leasing rental income could adversely affect the Company.The Company owns a portfolio of commercial income properties.  Factors that may adversely affect the portfolio’s profitability include:  •a significant number of the Company’s tenants are unable to meet their obligations;  •increases in non-recoverable operating and ownership costs;  •the Company is unable to lease space at its properties when the space becomes available;  •the rental rates upon a renewal or a new lease are significantly lower than prior rents or do not increase sufficiently to cover increases in operating and ownership costs;  •the providing of lease concessions, such as free or discounted rents and tenant improvement allowances; and  •the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues at the property.Governmental entities have adopted or may adopt regulatory requirements that may restrict the Company’s development activity.The Company is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the land development process, including laws and regulations related to zoning and permitted land uses.  Government entities have adopted or may approve regulations or laws that could negatively impact the availability of land and development opportunities within those areas.  For example, in December 2007, Maui County adopted an ordinance requiring verification of water source availability and sustainability for all developments prior to submission of subdivision construction plans.  This requirement adds further process delays and burdens the developer with identifying and developing new water sources.  It is possible that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers in the future that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to develop projects in the affected markets or could require that the Company satisfy additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could delay development progress or increase the development costs of the Company.  Any such delays or costs could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and earnings.Real estate development projects are subject to warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.As a developer, the Company is subject to warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The amounts payable under these claims, both in legal fees and remedying any construction defects, can be significant and exceed the profits made from the project. As a consequence, the Company may maintain liability insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from contractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials, and create warranty and other reserves for projects based on historical experience and qualitative risks associated with the type of project built. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, the Company cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage, contractor arrangements and reserves will be adequate to address some or all of the Company’s warranty and construction defect claims in the future. For example, contractual indemnities may be difficult to enforce, the Company may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions, and certain claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered and the availability of liability insurance for construction defects could be limited or costly. Accordingly, the Company cannot provide any assurance that such coverage will be adequate or available at all, or available at an acceptable cost.AGRIBUSINESSThe lack of water for agricultural irrigation could adversely affect the Company.It is crucial for the Company’s Agribusiness segment to have access to reliable sources of water for the irrigation of sugar cane and coffee. As further described in “Legal Proceedings” below, there are challenges to the Company’s ability to divert water from streams in Maui. In addition, the Company’s access to water is subject to weather patterns that cannot be reliably predicted.  If the Company is not permitted to divert stream waters for its use or there is insufficient rainfall, it would have an adverse effect on the Company’s sugar operations, including possible cessation of operations.A decline in raw sugar or coffee prices will adversely affect the Company’s business.The business and results of operations of the Company’s agribusiness segment are substantially affected by market factors, particularly the domestic prices for raw cane sugar. These market factors are influenced by a variety of forces, including prices of competing crops and suppliers, weather conditions, and United States farm and trade policies. If the price for sugar or coffee were to decline, the Company’s agribusiness segment would be adversely affected. See also discussion under “Business and Properties - Agribusiness - Competition and Sugar Legislation” above.The Company is subject to risks associated with raw sugar and coffee production.The Company’s production of raw sugar and coffee is subject to numerous risks that could adversely affect the volume and quality of sugar or coffee produced, including:  •weather and natural disasters;  •disease;  •weed control;  •uncontrolled fires, including arson;  •government restrictions on farming practices due to cane burning;  •increases in costs, including, but not limited to fuel, fertilizer, herbicide, and drip tubing;  •water availability (see risk factor above regarding lack of water);  •equipment failures in factory or power plant;        •labor, including labor availability (see risk factor above regarding labor disruptions) and loss of qualified personnel; and  •lack of demand for the Company’s production.Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company’s future agribusiness operating results.A reorganization or termination of the Company’s sugar business could result in impairment losses and restructuring costs.If the Company’s sugar business is unable to sustain profitability, the Company may reorganize or terminate its sugar operations. The reorganization or termination of sugar operations may result in an impairment loss and restructuring costs that would adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.The Company’s power sales contracts could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.The Company’s power sales contracts, as described under “Business and Properties – Energy” above, expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, which could adversely affect the Company’s agribusiness operations.The foregoing should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company or on its behalf"

13,MATX,MATSON INC,2007-02-26,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS         The business of A&B and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Company"")faces numerous risks, including those set forth below or those describedelsewhere in this Form 10-K or in the Company's filings with the SEC. The risksdescribed below are not the only risks that the Company faces, nor are theynecessarily listed in order of significance. Other risks and uncertainties mayalso impair its business operations. Any of these risks may have a materialadverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results ofoperations and cash flows. All forward-looking statements made by the Company oron the Company's behalf are qualified by the risks described below.GENERALAn economic decline or decrease in market demand for the Company's services andproducts in Hawaii, the U.S. mainland, Guam or Asia may adversely affect theCompany's operating results and financial condition.         A weakening of the economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism,military spending, construction starts and employment, or a decrease in marketdemand may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and real estateactivity in Hawaii. A decline in the overall economy or market demand in theU.S. mainland may reduce the demand for goods from Hawaii and Asia, travel toHawaii and domestic transportation of goods, adversely affecting inland andocean transportation volumes, the sale of Hawaii real estate to Mainland buyers,and the Hawaii real estate markets generally. A change in the cost of goods orcurrency exchange rates may decrease the freight volume from Asia to the UnitedStates.The Company may face new or increased competition.         The Company's transportation segment may face new competition by otherestablished or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company's markets. Theentry of a new competitor or the addition of ships or capacity by existingcompetition on any of the Company's routes could result in a significantincrease in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on theCompany's business. See also discussion under ""Business and Properties -Transportation - Competition"" above.         The Company's real estate segment operates in highly competitivemarkets. There are numerous other developers, managers and owners of commercialand residential real estate and undeveloped land that compete or may competewith the Company for management and leasing revenues, land for development,properties for acquisition and disposition, and for tenants and purchasers forproperties. Such competition could have an adverse effect on the Company'sbusiness.The Company's significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced.         The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in itsvarious businesses expire at various points in the future and could be replaced,thereby adversely affecting future revenue generation. For example, theCompany's agribusiness segment sells substantially all of its bulk raw sugarthrough the cooperative HS&TC, which has a supply contract with C&H SugarCompany, Inc., ending in December 2008. Replacement of this supply contract onless favorable terms to the Company may adversely affect the Company's sugarbusiness.Rising fuel prices and availability may adversely affect the Company's profits.         Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company's shipping andagribusiness operations. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable andfluctuates based on events beyond the Company's control. Increases in the priceof fuel may adversely affect the Company's results of operations based on marketand competitive conditions. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to otherexpense increases, through, for example, increased costs of energy,petroleum-based raw materials and purchased transportation services. In theCompany's ocean transportation and logistics segments, the Company is able toutilize fuel surcharges to partially recover increases in fuel expense, althoughincreases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Company's competitiveposition and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuelexpense. Changes in the Company's ability to collect fuel surcharges mayadversely affect its results of operations. Rising fuel prices may also increasethe cost of construction, including delivery costs to Hawaii, thus affecting theCompany's development projects, as well as the cost of producing andtransporting sugar. In addition, rising fuel prices may suppress economicactivity generally.Changes to federal, state or local law or regulations may adversely affect theCompany's business.         The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws andregulations, including government rate regulations, land use regulations,government administration of the U.S. sugar program, environmental regulationsrelating to air quality initiatives at port locations, and cabotage laws.Changes to the laws and regulations governing the Company's business couldimpose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect theCompany's financial condition. For example, if the Jones Act and the regulationspromulgated thereunder were repealed, amended, or otherwise modified, non-U.S.competitors with significantly lower costs may consequently enter any of theJones Act routes or the Company's business may be significantly altered, all ofwhich may have an adverse effect on the Company's shipping business.Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of theCompany or other companies in related industries may adversely affect theCompany's operations.         As of December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately 2,197 regularfull-time employees, of which approximately 49 percent were covered bycollective bargaining agreements with unions. The Company's transportation, realestate and agribusiness segments may be adversely affected by actions taken byemployees of the Company or other companies in related industries againstefforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage increases or modifywork practices. Strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of the failure ofthe Company or other companies in its industry to negotiate collectivebargaining agreements with such unions successfully. For example, in its realestate segment, the Company may be unable to complete construction of itsprojects if building materials or labor is unavailable due to labor disruptionsin the relevant trade groups.The loss of or damage to key vendor and customer relationships may adverselyaffect the Company's business.         The Company's business is dependent on its relationships with keyvendors and customers. The ocean transportation business relies on itsrelationships with freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods andautomobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers. Relationships withrailroads and shipping companies are important in the Company's intermodalbusiness. The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may affect theCompany's business adversely.Interruption or failure of the Company's information technology andcommunications systems could impair the Company's ability to operate andadversely affect its business.         The Company is highly dependent on information technology systems. Forexample, in the transportation segment, these dependencies primarily includeaccounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel schedulingand stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employeecommunication systems. All information technology and communication systems aresubject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, andsecurity-threatening intrusions. The Company may experience failures caused bythe occurrence of a natural disaster, or other unanticipated problems at theCompany's facilities. Any failure of the Company's systems could result ininterruptions in its service or production, reducing its revenue and profits anddamaging its reputation.The Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters.         The Company's transportation operations are vulnerable to disruption asa result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea,hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis and earthquakes. Such events will interfere withthe Company's ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting inincreased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interferencewith the Company's terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to itsvessels, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss oflife or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverseeffect on the Company's business.         For the real estate segment, the occurrence of natural disasters, suchas hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires and unusually heavy orprolonged rain, could have a material adverse effect on its ability to developand sell properties or realize income from its projects. The occurrence ofnatural disasters could also cause increases in property insurance rates anddeductibles, which could reduce demand for, or increase the cost of owning ordeveloping, the Company's properties.         For the agribusiness segment, drought, greater than normal rainfall,hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires, other natural disasters oragricultural pestilence may have an adverse effect on the sugar and coffeeplanting, harvesting and production, and the agribusiness segment's facilities,including dams and reservoirs.Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks,efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact theCompany's operations and profitability.         War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumerconfidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability of tourists toget to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting the Company. Additionally, futureterrorist attacks could increase the volatility in the U.S. and worldwidefinancial markets. Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company'sshipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control ofMatson's vessels for military operation. Heightened security measures are likelyto slow the movement of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders oron U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect theCompany's business and results of operations.Loss of the Company's key personnel could adversely affect its business.         The Company's future success will depend, in significant part, upon thecontinued services of its key personnel, including its senior management andskilled employees. The loss of the services of key personnel could adverselyaffect its future operating results because of such employee's experience andknowledge of its business and customer relationships. If key employees depart,the Company may have to incur significant costs to replace them and its abilityto execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in atimely manner. The Company does not expect to maintain key person insurance onany of its key personnel.The Company is involved in joint ventures and is subject to risks associatedwith joint venture relationships.         The Company is involved in joint venture relationships, and mayinitiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain riskssuch as:         o        the Company may not have voting control over the joint                  venture;         o        the Company may not be able to maintain good relationships                  with its joint venture partners;         o        the venture partner at any time may have economic or                  business interests that are inconsistent with the Company's;         o        the venture partner may fail to fund its share of operations                  and development activities, or to fulfill its other                  commitments, including providing accurate and timely                  accounting and financial information to the Company; and         o        the joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel.         In connection with its real estate joint ventures, the Company issometimes asked to guarantee completion of a joint venture's construction anddevelopment of a project, or to indemnify a third party serving as surety for ajoint venture's bonds for such completion. If the Company were to becomeobligated under such arrangement, the Company may be adversely affected.The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, orlegal or other proceedings, that could have a material adverse effect on theCompany.         The nature of the Company's business exposes it to the potential fordisputes, or legal or other proceedings, relating to labor and employmentmatters, personal injury and property damage, environmental matters,construction litigation, and other matters, as discussed in the other riskfactors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC. Inaddition, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practicesin dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign,federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes oradministrative and/or judicial proceedings. These disputes, individually orcollectively, could harm the Company's business by distracting its managementfrom the operation of its business. If these disputes develop into proceedings,these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve significantexpenditures by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson'stariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of whichcould have an adverse effect on the Company's future operating results,including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For a descriptionof significant legal proceedings involving the Company, see ""Legal Proceedings""below.TRANSPORTATIONThe Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreignshipping market.         In February 2006, Matson launched its Hawaii/Guam/China service. TheCompany is subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreignshipping market, which include:         o        challenges in operating in a foreign country and doing                  business and developing relationships with foreign companies;         o        difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;         o        legal and regulatory restrictions;         o        decreases in shipping rates;         o        competition with established and new shippers;         o        difficulties in developing and establishing brand recognition;         o        currency exchange rate fluctuations;         o        political and economic instability; and         o        challenges caused by cultural differences.         Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company'soperating results.Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company's business.         The Company's growth strategy, especially in logistics services,includes expansion through acquisitions. Acquisitions may result in difficultiesin assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of theCompany's capital and its management's attention from other business issues andopportunities. The Company may not be able to integrate companies that itacquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems,distribution, operations and general operating procedures. The Company may alsoencounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financialreporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company.The Company's logistics services are dependent upon third parties for equipment,capacity and services essential to operate their business, and if they fail tosecure sufficient third party services, their business could be adverselyaffected.         The Company's logistics services are dependent upon rail, truck andocean transportation services provided by independent third parties. If theycannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services fromthese third parties at a reasonable rate to meet their customers' needs andschedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needsmet by other third parties on a temporary or permanent basis. As a result, theCompany's business, consolidated results of operations and financial conditioncould be adversely affected.The loss of several of the Company's logistics services major customers couldhave an adverse effect on the Company's revenue and business.         The Company's logistics services derive a significant portion of theirrevenues from their largest customers. For 2006, the Company's logisticsservices' largest ten customers accounted for approximately 37% of the Company'slogistics services' revenue. A reduction in or termination of the Company'slogistics services by several of their largest customers could have an adverseeffect on the Company's revenue and business.REAL ESTATEThe Company is subject to risks associated with real estate construction anddevelopment.         The Company's development projects are subject to risks relating to theCompany's ability to complete its projects on time and on budget. Factors thatmay result in a development project exceeding budget or being prevented fromcompletion include:         o        an inability to secure sufficient financing or insurance on                  favorable terms, or at all;         o        construction delays or cost overruns, either of which may                  increase project development costs;         o        an increase in commodity or construction costs;         o        the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other                  environmental problems;         o        an inability to obtain zoning, occupancy and other required                  governmental permits and authorizations;         o        an inability or difficulty in complying with local, city,                  county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting,                  zoning, subdivision, utilities and water quality as well as                  federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality                  and protection of endangered species and their habitats;         o        an inability to have access to reliable sources of water;         o        an inability to secure tenants necessary to support the                  project;         o        failure to achieve or sustain anticipated occupancy or sales                  levels; and         o        an inability to sell the Company's constructed inventory.         Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company'sfuture operating results.A decline in leasing rental income could adversely affect the Company.         The Company owns a portfolio of commercial income properties. Factorsthat may adversely affect the Company's profitability include:         o        a significant number of the Company's tenants are unable to                  meet their obligations;         o        operating and ownership costs are materially higher than                  anticipated;         o        the Company is unable to lease space at its properties when                  the space becomes available;         o        the rental rates upon a renewal or a new lease are                  significantly lower than expected; or         o        the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other                  environmental problems.Governmental entities have adopted or may adopt regulatory requirements that mayrestrict the Company's development activity.         The Company is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulationsthat affect the land development process, including laws and regulations relatedto zoning and permitted land uses. Government entities have adopted or mayapprove homebuilding regulations or laws that could negatively impact theavailability of land and building opportunities within those areas. In December2006, Maui County adopted a Residential Workforce Housing Policy, which requiresdevelopers of residential developments of five or more units to sell or rent 40%to 50% of the total number of units at below market rates, or pay significantfees or contribute property to the County for low-income housing. Theserequirements could make the cost of developing new projects prohibitive. It ispossible that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developersin the future that could adversely affect the Company's ability to developprojects in the affected markets or could require that the Company satisfyadditional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could delaydevelopment progress or increase the development costs of the Company. Any suchdelays or costs could have an adverse effect on the Company's revenues andearnings.AGRIBUSINESSThe unavailability of water for agricultural irrigation could adversely affectthe Company.         It is crucial for the Company's agribusiness segment to have access toreliable sources of water for the irrigation of sugar cane and coffee. Asfurther described in ""Legal Proceedings"" below, there are two administrativehearing processes challenging the Company's ability to divert water from streamsin Maui. If the Company is not permitted to divert stream waters for its use, itwould have an adverse effect on the Company's sugar operations.A decline in raw sugar or coffee prices will adversely affect the Company'sbusiness.         The business and results of operations of the Company's agribusinesssegment are substantially affected by market factors, principally the domesticand international prices for raw cane sugar. These market factors are influencedby a variety of forces, including prices of competing crops, weather conditions,and United States farm and trade policies. If the price for sugar or coffee wereto drop, the Company's agribusiness segment would be adversely affected. Seealso discussion under ""Business and Properties - Agribusiness - Competition andSugar Legislation"" above.The Company is subject to risks associated with raw sugar and coffee production.         The Company's raw sugar and coffee production are subject to risks,which include:         o        weather;         o        disease;         o        poor farming practices;         o        increases in costs, including, but not limited to fertilizer,                  fuel, and drip tubing;         o        water availability (see risk factor above regarding                  unavailability of water);         o        equipment failures in factory or power plant; and         o        labor, including labor availability (see risk factor above                  regarding labor disruptions).         Any of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company'sfuture agribusiness operating results.OTHEREarnings on pension assets, or a change in pension law and on key assumptions,may adversely affect the Company's financial performance.         The amount of the Company's employee retirement benefit costs andobligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarialcalculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic orother factors, or lower returns on plan assets, may adversely affect theCompany's operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, achange in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adverselyaffect the Company's single-employer and multiemployer pension plans and planfunding.The Company may have exposure under its multiemployer plans in which itparticipate that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to theCompany's employees.         The Company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans. In theevent of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan which isunderfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of suchplan's unfunded vested benefits. Based on the limited information available fromplan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, theCompany believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of afull withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position andresults of operations. In the event that any other contributing employerwithdraws from any plan which is underfunded, and such employer (or any memberin its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at thetime of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remainingcontributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of suchplan's unfunded vested benefits. In addition, if a multiemployer plan fails tosatisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service willimpose certain penalties and taxes.The Company is required to evaluate its internal controls over financialreporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any adverseresults from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence inthe Company's financial reports and have an adverse effect on the Company'sstock price.         Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that publicly reportingcompanies cause their managements to perform annual assessments of theeffectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting and theirindependent auditors to prepare reports that address such assessments. Althoughthe Company has concluded that its internal controls over financial reportingwere effective as of December 31, 2006, there can be no assurances that theCompany will reach the same conclusion at the end of future years. If theCompany is unable to assert that its internal control over financial reportingis effective, or if the Company's auditors are unable to attest that itsmanagement's report is fairly stated or if they are unable to express an opinionon the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls, the Company could loseinvestor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports,which would have an adverse effect on the Company's stock price.         The foregoing should not be construed as an exhaustive list of allfactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from thoseexpressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company or on its behalf"
8,MATX,MATSON INC,2006-02-24,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS         The business of A&B and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Company"")faces numerous risks, including those set forth below or those describedelsewhere in this Form 10-K or in the Company's filings with the SEC. The risksdescribed below are not the only risks that the Company faces, nor are theynecessarily listed in order of significance. Other risks and uncertainties mayalso impair its business operations. Any of these risks may have a materialadverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results ofoperations and cash flows.An economic decline or decrease in market demand for the Company's services andproducts in Hawaii, the U.S. mainland or Asia may adversely affect the Company'soperating results and financial condition.         Adverse economic conditions or a decrease in market demand for theCompany's services and products in Hawaii, the U.S. mainland or Asia maynegatively impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows. Aweakening of the economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, militaryspending, construction starts and employment, or a decrease in market demand mayadversely impact the level of freight volumes and real estate activity inHawaii. A decline in the overall economy or market demand in the U.S. mainlandmay reduce the demand for goods from Hawaii and Asia, travel to Hawaii anddomestic transportation of goods, adversely affecting inland and oceantransportation volumes, the sale of Hawaii real estate to Mainland buyers, andthe Hawaii real estate markets generally. A change in the cost of goods orcurrency exchange may decrease the freight volume from Asia to the UnitedStates.The Company may face new or increased competition.         The Company's transportation segment may face new competition by otherestablished or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company's markets. Theentry of a new competitor or the addition of ships by existing competition onany of the Company's routes could result in a significant increase in availableshipping capacity that could have a material adverse effect on the Company'sbusiness. See also discussion under ""Business and Properties - Transportation -Competition"" above.         The Company's real estate segment operates in highly competitivemarkets. There are numerous other developers, managers and owners of commercialand residential real estate and undeveloped land that compete or may competewith the Company. They compete or may compete with the Company for managementand leasing revenues, land for development, properties for acquisition anddisposition, and for tenants and purchasers for properties. Such competitioncould have an adverse effect on the Company's business.The Company is subject to risks associated with entering into a foreign shippingmarket.         In February 2006, Matson launched its Hawaii/Guam/China service. TheCompany has not operated in China before and has limited experience withoperations outside of the United States. The Company is subject to risksassociated with entering a foreign shipping market, which include:         o challenges caused by language and cultural differences;         o challenges in doing business with a foreign government and foreign           companies;         o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;         o legal and regulatory restrictions;         o decreases in shipping rates;         o competition with established shippers;         o difficulties in building relationships with foreign businesses and           establishing brand recognition;         o currency exchange rate fluctuations;         o political and economic instability; and         o customary operational risks related to starting a new business.         If some or any of these risk factors occur, the Company's futureoperating results may be adversely affected.The Company's significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced.         The significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in itsvarious businesses expire at various points in the future and could be replaced,thereby adversely affecting future revenue generation. For example, theCompany's food products segment sells substantially all of its bulk raw sugarthrough the cooperative HS&TC, which has a supply contract with C&H SugarCompany, Inc., ending in December 2008. Replacement of this supply contract onless favorable terms to the Company may adversely affect the Company's sugarbusiness.Rising fuel prices may adversely affect the Company's profits.         Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company's shippingoperations. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates basedon events beyond the Company's control. Increases in the price of fuel mayadversely affect the Company's results of operations. Rising fuel prices mayalso increase the cost of construction materials delivered to Hawaii, thusaffecting the Company's development projects, as well as the cost of producingand transporting sugar. In addition, rising fuel prices may suppress economicactivity generally.Increases in interest rates may adversely affect the Company's profits.         An increase in interest rates could reduce the demand fortransportation of goods, real estate, coffee and sugar. Such reduction in demandcould adversely affect the Company's profitability. An increase in interestrates may also increase the cost of financing to the Company. See alsodiscussion regarding interest rates in Item 7A below.Changes to federal, state or local law may adversely affect the Company'sbusiness.         The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws andregulations, including government rate regulations, land use regulations,government administration of the U.S. sugar program, new environmentalregulations relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, and cabotagelaws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing the Company's business couldadversely affect the Company's financial condition. For example, if the JonesAct were repealed or substantially amended, the Company's shipping businesscould be adversely affected.The Company is subject to risks associated with real estate construction anddevelopment.         The Company's development projects are subject to risks relating to theCompany's ability to complete its projects on time and on budget. Factors thatmay result in a development project exceeding budget or being prevented fromcompletion include:         o an inability to secure sufficient financing or insurance on           favorable terms;         o construction delays or cost overruns, either of which may increase           project development costs;         o an increase in commodity costs;         o the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other           environmental problems;         o an inability to obtain zoning, occupancy and other required           governmental permits and authorizations;         o an inability to secure tenants necessary to support the project;         o failure to achieve or sustain anticipated occupancy or sales levels;           and         o an inability to sell the Company's constructed inventory.         If some or any of these risk factors occur, the Company may not achieveits projected returns on projects under development.The unavailability of water for agricultural irrigation and to support realestate development could adversely affect the Company.         It is crucial for the Company's real estate and food products segmentsto have access to reliable sources of water for the development of real estateprojects and the irrigation of sugar cane and coffee, respectively. As furtherdescribed in ""Legal Proceedings"" below, there are two administrative hearingprocesses challenging the Company's ability to divert water from streams inMaui. If the Company is not permitted to divert stream waters for its use, itwould have a significant adverse effect on the Company's sugar operations.The Company is involved in joint ventures and is subject to risks associatedwith joint venture relationships.         The Company is involved in joint venture relationships, especially inits real estate segment, and may initiate future joint venture projects as partof the Company's overall development strategy. A joint venture involves certainrisks such as:         o the Company may not have voting control over the joint venture;         o the venture partner at any time may have economic or business           interests that are inconsistent with the Company's; and         o the venture partner could experience financial or other difficulties           and be unable to fulfill its commitments.Interruption or failure of the Company's information technology andcommunications systems could impair the Company's ability to effectively provideits shipping and logistics services, which could damage the Company's reputationand harm its operating results.         The Company, especially its transportation segment, is highly dependenton information technology systems. These dependencies primarily includeaccounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking, vessel scheduling and stowage,customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems. All ofthese systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibilityconcerns, and security-threatening intrusions. The Company may experience briefor extended failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, or otherunanticipated problems at the Company's facilities. Any failure of the Company'ssystems could result in interruptions in its service, reducing its revenue andprofits and damaging its reputation.A decline in raw sugar prices will adversely affect the Company's business.         The business and results of operations of the Company's food productssegment are substantially affected by market factors, principally the domesticand international prices for raw cane sugar. These market factors are influencedby a variety of forces, including prices of competing crops, weather conditions,and United States farm and trade policies. If the price for raw cane sugar wereto drop, the Company's food products segment may be adversely affected. See alsodiscussion under ""Business and Properties - Food Products - Competition andSugar Legislation"" above.The Company is subject to risks associated with raw sugar and coffee production.         The Company's raw sugar and coffee production are subject to risks,which include:         o weather;         o disease;         o water availability (see risk factor above regarding unavailability           of water); and         o equipment failures in factory or power plant.         If some or any of these risk factors occur, the Company's food productssegment may be adversely affected.Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the Company's unionized employeesmay adversely affect the Company's operations.         As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 2,177 regularfull-time employees, of which approximately 48 percent were covered bycollective bargaining agreements with unions. The Company's transportation andfood products segments may be adversely affected by employee action againstefforts by its management or the management of other companies in its industryto control labor costs, restrain wage increases or modify work practices. Inaddition, in the future, the Company may not be able to negotiate, on terms andconditions favorable to it, renewals of its collective bargaining agreementswith unions in its industry and strikes and disruptions may occur as a result ofits failure or the failure of other companies in its industry to negotiatecollective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.The loss of or damage to key vendor and customer relationships may adverselyaffect the Company's business.         The Company's business is dependent on its relationships with keyvendors and customers. The ocean transportation business relies on itsrelationships with freight forwarders, and large retailers and consumer goodsand automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers. Relationshipswith railroads and shipping companies are important in the Company's intermodalbusiness. For the food products segment, its relationship with C&H Sugar Companyaffects the Company's sale of raw sugar. The loss of or damage to any of thesekey relationships may affect the Company's business adversely.Earnings on pension assets, or a change in pension law and on key assumptions,may adversely affect the Company's financial performance.         The amount of the Company's employee retirement benefit costs andobligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarialcalculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic orother factors, or lower returns on plan assets, may adversely affect theCompany's results and financial condition. In addition, a change in federal law,including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and PensionBenefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company'ssingle-employer and multiemployer pension plans and plan funding.The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, orlegal or other proceedings, that could have a material adverse effect on theCompany.         The nature of the Company's business exposes it to the potential fordisputes, or legal or other proceedings, from time to time relating to labor andemployment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental matters,construction litigation, and other matters, as discussed in the other riskfactors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC. Inaddition, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practicesin dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign,federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes oradministrative and/or judicial proceedings from time to time. These disputes,individually or collectively, could harm the Company's business by distractingits management from the operation of its business. If these disputes developinto proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involvesignificant expenditures by the Company, or result in significant changes toMatson's tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, allof which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future revenueand profitability. For a description of significant legal proceedings involvingthe Company, see ""Legal Proceedings"" below.The Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters.         The Company's transportation operations are vulnerable to disruption asa result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea,hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis and earthquakes. Such events will interfere withthe Company's ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting inincreased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events.In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interferencewith the Company's terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to itsvessels, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss oflife or physical injury to its employees.         For the real estate segment, the occurrence of natural disasters, suchas hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, fires and unusually heavy or prolonged rain,could have a material adverse effect on its ability to develop and sellproperties or realize income from its projects. The occurrence of naturaldisasters could also cause increases in property insurance rates anddeductibles, which could reduce demand for, or increase the cost of owning ordeveloping, the Company's properties.         For the food products segment, drought, greater than normal rainfall,hurricanes or agricultural pestilence may have an adverse effect on the sugarand coffee planting, harvesting and production.         Weather and natural disasters could trigger an economic downturn, whichmay lead to lower demand for shipping or real estate.War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may adversely impact theCompany's operations and profitability.         War, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumerconfidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability of tourists toget to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting the Company. Additionally, futureterrorist attacks could increase the volatility in the U.S. and worldwidefinancial markets. Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company'sshipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control ofMatson's vessels for military operation. Any of these occurrences could have asignificant adverse impact on the Company's revenues, costs and operatingresults.Loss of the Company's key personnel could adversely affect its business.         The Company's future success will depend, in significant part, upon thecontinued services of its key personnel, including its senior management. Theloss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect its futureoperating results because of such employee's experience and knowledge of itsbusiness and customer relationships. If key employees depart, the Company mayhave to incur significant costs to replace them and its ability to execute itsbusiness model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner.The Company does not expect to maintain key person insurance on any of its keypersonnel.If the Company is not in compliance with relevant laws and regulations, such ascontinuing to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, it could have an adverse effect on theCompany's financial results or the market price of the Company's stock.         The Company will continue its ongoing process of addressing allcompliance matters. If the Company is not in compliance for any reason with allrelevant laws and regulations, such as maintaining effective internal controlsover financial reporting, the Company's financial results or the market price ofthe Company's stock could be adversely affected, and the Company may be subjectto penalties and sanctions"
