Risk Factor SummaryThe following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in our company speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described in the Risk Factors
 section below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors
 section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. The order of presentation is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each factor poses to us.Risks Arising from Our Business:Our business model and the operations of our business involve risks, including those related to:•investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties;•unknown liability exposure related to acquired properties;•competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices; •our joint venture partners;•Seniors Housing Operating properties operational risks;•our ability to terminate our management agreements with Seniors Housing Operating managers;•operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures; •the ability of operators and tenants to make payments to us;•the impacts of severe cold and flu seasons or other widespread illnesses on occupancy;•the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors; •our ability to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us; •any adverse developments in the business or financial condition of Sunrise and Integra; •any failure, inability or unwillingness by Integra to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us;•ownership of property outside the U.S.; •our ability to lease or sell properties on favorable terms;•tenant, operator and manager insurance coverage;•loss of properties owned through ground leases upon breach or termination of the ground leases;•requirements of, or changes to governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding;•controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay;•our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards;•development, redevelopment and construction; •bank failures or other events affecting financial institutions;•losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change;•costs incurred to remediate environmental contamination at our properties;•our reliance on data and technology systems and the increasing risks of cybersecurity incidents;•evolving privacy regulations;•ESG-related commitments and expectations;•our dependence on key personnel; and•Welltower's holding company status.Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure Our capital structure involves exposure to risks, including those related to:•our future leverage;•the availability of cash for distributions to stockholders;•covenants in our debt agreements; •limitations on our ability to access capital; •any downgrades in our credit ratings; and•increases in interest rates. 30Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT As a result of our status as a REIT, we are exposed to risks, including those related to:•our ability to remain qualified as a REIT;•Welltower OP's ability to maintain status of a partnership;•the ability of our subsidiaries to qualify as a REIT;•the impact of tax imposed on any net income from ""prohibited transactions"" may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes;•the impact of the 90% annual distribution requirement on our liquidity and ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions;•our limited ability to use taxable REIT subsidiaries under the Code;•special requirements applicable to the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary;•the tax imposed on any net income from ""prohibited transactions"";•tax consequences if certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the IRS as “true leases""; •changes in our tax rate or exposure to additional tax liabilities; and•the impact to our TRSs of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax imposed by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.Risks FactorsThis section highlights significant factors, events and uncertainties that could create risk with an investment in our securities. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face: our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. We group these risk factors into three categories:•Risks arising from our business;•Risks arising from our capital structure; and•Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our BusinessOur investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations Some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations. Investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all. We may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Health care properties are often highly customizable, and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. The actual costs of development or redevelopment may be greater than our estimates. We have experienced delays and disruptions to property redevelopment as a result of supply chain issues and construction material and labor shortages and may experience additional or more significant such delays in the future. We also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. These risks may be exacerbated by the volume and complexity of such activity, as well as geopolitical tension or instability, inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities and may lead to impairment of such assets. 31Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilityWe may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include: liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for propertiesIn order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns, we seek to reinvest cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities, principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties, including non-elective dispositions in a timely manner. We face competition for acquisition opportunities from other well-capitalized investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors. In addition, limited development during the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the number of new properties becoming available. This competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors and, even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.Our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations, and disputes between us and our partners We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture; that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests; and that our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest and risks to our REIT status. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell, put right or forced sale arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, acquire our partner’s interest or sell the underlying asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. On the other hand, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited and/or valued lower than fair market value. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property.We assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionWe have entered into various joint ventures that were structured under the provisions of RIDEA, which permits REITs to own or partially own “qualified health care properties” in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations (as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments) in compliance with REIT requirements. A “qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients.Under a RIDEA structure, we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property, including complying with laws and providing resident care. However, as the owner of the property under a RIDEA structure, we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property, including, those relating to employment matters of our operators, compliance with health care fraud and abuse and other laws, governmental reimbursement matters, data privacy and security laws, compliance with federal, state, local and industry-related licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards, and litigation involving our properties or residents/patients, even though we have limited ability to control or influence our operators’ management of these risks. Further, our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) is generally required to hold the applicable health care license and enroll in the applicable government health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), which subjects us to potential liability under various health care laws. Penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws may include loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need, certification or accreditation, exclusion from government health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties. Although we have some general oversight approval rights and the right to review operational and financial reporting information, our operators are 32ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the property, including clinical decision-making, and we rely on them to operate the properties in a manner that complies with applicable law.We are exposed to operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operationsWe are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy experienced during the normal course of business, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions; the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise); competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; increases in property taxes; state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and federal and state housing laws and regulations. Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations and could eventually lead to impairment of our properties.We have rights to terminate our management agreements with operators, in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace operators if our management agreements are terminated or not renewedWe are party to long-term management agreements with our Seniors Housing Operating managers pursuant to which they provide comprehensive property management, accounting and other services with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. We have the ability to  terminate any of our management agreements upon the occurrence of certain events such as insolvency relating to such manager, and in some cases, upon the failure to meet specific NOI targets without curing (to the extent there is an ability to cure). In addition, many of our management agreements are terminable by us for no cause upon a reasonable notice period and in some cases, upon payment of a termination fee.We regularly monitor and review our rights and remedies under our management agreements. When determining if we will take significant action under those agreements, including terminating a manager, we consider numerous legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant factors. In exercising our rights to terminate or not renew a management agreement, we would work with our existing seniors housing operators or potentially new operators to manage the properties; however, there is no assurance that we would be able to timely source a replacement or that any replacement manager would be effective. Any transition to a new manager would most likely require regulatory approval and potentially the approval of the holders of any liens on the property. The failure to replace on a timely basis, as well as the failure to receive these approvals, either at all or in a timely manner, could have an adverse effect on the properties and our revenue.  Decreases in our operators’ or tenants' revenues or increases in our operators’ or tenants' expenses, including as a result of increased labor costs, could affect their ability to make payments to usWe have very limited control over the success or failure of our operators' or tenants' businesses and, at any time, an operator or tenant may experience a downturn in their business that weakens their financial condition. Our operators’ and tenants' revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses are primarily driven by the costs of labor, supplies, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating and borrowing costs have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, for our operators and tenants. In particular, our operators' and tenants' businesses have experienced increases in labor costs resulting from shortages of medical and non-medical staff. A number of factors have adversely affected the labor force available to our operators and tenants or labor costs, including increased industry competition, high employment levels, increased wages offered by other employers, and government regulations. In many geographic areas the scarcity of specialized medical personnel, experienced senior care professionals and other workers has been a significant operating issue affecting a wide range of healthcare providers and senior care and housing facilities. Such shortages have and may continue to impact the operations of our operators and tenants, resulting in increased labor and operating costs. Continued labor shortages or cost inflation may impact our operators' and tenants' abilities to comply with minimum staffing requirements under applicable federal and state regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements can, among other things, jeopardize a facility's compliance with the conditions of participation under relevant state and federal healthcare programs. In addition, if a facility is determined to be out of compliance with these requirements, it may be subject to fines and other regulatory penalties, including the suspension of patient admissions, the termination of Medicaid participation or the suspension or revocation of licenses. To the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in an operator or tenant not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator or tenant and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results. These risks are magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator or tenant under a master lease, as a failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. Although our lease agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.33Increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ and managers' ability to meet their obligations to us The operators and managers of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators and managers of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients, including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price, and location. In addition, in light of labor shortages for medical and non-medical workers in many geographic areas, our operators and tenants increasingly compete to attract qualified and experienced employees. Our operators and managers are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents and employees or expand their businesses. In addition, we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities. We cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that meet our expected yields and fulfill their obligations to us. If our operators and managers cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities, their financial performance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.A severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net propertiesOur business and operations are exposed to risks from COVID-19, severe cold and flu seasons or the occurrence of other epidemics, pandemics or other widespread illnesses. Our revenues and our operators' revenues are dependent on occupancy and the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, a resurgence of COVID-19 or other epidemics, pandemics, widespread illness or public health crises. Such a decrease would affect the operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make payments to us. As we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, a future flu or other pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators, including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents or see a reduction in occupancy, and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The impacts of such events could be severe and far-reaching, and may impact our operations in several ways, including: (i) operators and tenants could experience deteriorating financial conditions and be unable or unwilling to pay payments to us on time and in full; (ii) we may have to restructure operators' or tenants' obligations and may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us; (iii) we may experience increased operational challenges and costs resulting from logistical challenges such as supply chain interruptions, business closures, restrictions on the movement of people and remote or hybrid work schedules, which introduce additional operational risks including cybersecurity risks; (iv) increased operational costs incurred by us and our operators across all of our properties as a result of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties and operations, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators and tenants, unique pressures on seniors housing and medical practice employees during pandemics like the COVID-19 pandemic including labor shortages resulting from macroeconomic trends; and (v) costs of development including expenditures for materials utilized in construction and labor essential to complete existing developments in progress, may increase substantially.The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, which may result in a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. The properties managed by Sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us As of December 31, 2023, Sunrise managed 88 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income. Under our management agreements, we rely on Sunrise’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage 34our Seniors Housing Operating properties efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, we depend on Sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. A shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force Sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. Any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by Sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in Sunrise’s senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our Seniors Housing Operating properties and have a material adverse effect on us. Also, if Sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could result in, among other things, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we determine to sell or transition properties currently managed by Sunrise, we may experience operational challenges and/or significantly declining financial performance for those properties.We depend on Integra for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect usAs of December 31, 2023, we lease 147 properties to Integra under a triple-net master lease, which account for a significant portion of our revenues. Integra subleases these properties to various regional operators who manage the property operations. We depend on Integra to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. We cannot assure you that Integra will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our lease, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by Integra to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Integra has also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with the facilities, and we cannot assure you that Integra will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. Integra's failure to effectively oversee the operations of their subtenants or their obligation to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect the subtenant operators' business reputations and the subtenant operators' ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Ownership of property outside the U.S. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations We have operations in the U.K. and Canada which represent 9.1% and 7.7% of total Welltower revenues, respectively. International development, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, any international currency gain or loss recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates, which may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test required for us to satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants' supply chain and consumer spending levels; changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions (regionally, nationally and locally) including, challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in foreign countries; local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political and economic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Further, our operations in the U.K. may be adversely impacted by global and local economic volatility experienced as a result of geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, rising inflation and interest rates, the energy crisis that has seen supply shortages and higher oil, gas and electricity prices, volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, an increase in cybersecurity incidents, as well as labor market challenges affecting the recruitment and retention of employees.If our tenants do not renew their existing leases, or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons, we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms, or at allWe cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties, or sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our competitors may offer 35space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire. In addition, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms.Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator, economic and other conditions will be limited. Although our properties are less affected by the commercial real estate market trends, this limitation could be exacerbated by the current decline of commercial real estate as a result of high interest rates, inflation and declining property values across sectors. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Our tenants, operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses We maintain or require our tenants, operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. Our tenants, operators and managers may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages. Also, we may not be able to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements, which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss. We cannot make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. Insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or policies may not be maintained at a level that will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. This may be especially the case due to increases in property insurance costs. In addition, in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets. Finally, our use, and the usage by some of our tenants, operators and managers of self-insurance and/or use of a wholly owned captive insurance company, if not adequately funded, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and that of our tenants, operators and managers.Our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. Many of these ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us Some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, change-of-ownership rules, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), any lapse in Congressional funding of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. Federal and state authorities may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Reimbursement” above for additional information. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its 36obligations to us. In addition, if a partial or total federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time, federal government payment obligations, including its obligations under Medicaid and Medicare, may be delayed. Similarly, if state government shutdowns were to occur, state payment obligations may be delayed. If the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis, our business could suffer, and our financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected.Since January 1, 2014, the Health Reform Laws have provided those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise ineligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. The federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion and as of December 2023, the number of states implementing expansion has grown to more than 80% of all states. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants. Health reform measures could be implemented as a result of political, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. Further the impact that the recent change of control of the House and future changes in the federal government may have on health reform (including through new legislative, executive or regulatory efforts) remains uncertain, and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Health Reform Laws. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. More generally, and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business, or that of our operators and tenants. If controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our health care facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affectedControls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization reviews,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our health care facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required pre-admission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide health care services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. If so, this could adversely affect these tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and/or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us.Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us Our operators and tenants generally are subject to or impacted by varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards. These laws and regulations include, among others: laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices; laws relating to the operation of our facilities and how our tenants and operators conduct their business, such as fire, health and safety, data security and privacy laws; federal and state laws affecting hospitals, clinics and other health care communities that participate in both Medicare and Medicaid that specify reimbursement rates, pricing, reimbursement procedures and limitations, quality of services and care, background checks, food service and physical plants, and similar foreign laws regulating the health care industry; resident rights laws (including abuse and neglect laws) and fraud laws; anti-kickback and physician referral laws; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or similar foreign agencies. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs, civil liability, and in certain limited instances, criminal penalties, material restrictions on or loss of license, closure of the facility and/or the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. In addition, we may be directly subject to these laws, regulations and standards, as well as potential investigation or enforcement and liability, as a result of our RIDEA-structured arrangements, and certain other arrangements we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to these laws. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Fraud & Abuse Enforcement” and “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Health Care Matters - Generally” above.Many of our properties may require a license, registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make a profit or our 37operators' or tenants' ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. In addition, we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the health care industry, including our tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants and operators will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor cost levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us.Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionFrom time to time, we are directly involved or named as a party in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims that involve class actions, disputes regarding property damage, care matters and other issues. We also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. Employment related class action lawsuits have increased in recent years, including class action lawsuits brought against our operators in certain states regarding employee and government requirements regarding wage and hour claims and fair housing complaints, as well as class action lawsuits related to staffing and care. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses, significantly divert the attention of management, and could damage our reputation and our brand. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business. We cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage.Development, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitabilityWe invest in various development and redevelopment projects. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected construction costs, lease up velocity, occupancy, rental rates, operating expenses, capital costs and future competition. If our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate, the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. Our development/redevelopment and construction projects are vulnerable to the impact of material shortages and inflation. For example, shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials have resulted in and could continue to result in delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our projects. Pricing for labor and raw materials can be affected by various national, regional, local, economic and political factors, including changes to immigration laws that impact the availability of labor or tariffs on imported construction materials. Additional conditions and risks affecting our development/redevelopment and construction projects include: (i) liability if our communities are not constructed in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Acts, the Fair Housing Act or other federal, state or local requirements, which noncompliance could result in imposition of fines, an award of damage to private litigants and a requirement that we undertake structural modifications to remedy the noncompliance; (ii) cost overruns, especially in the current inflationary environment, and untimely completion of construction (including risks beyond our control, such as weather or labor conditions, material shortages or supply chain delays); (iii) the potential for fluctuation of occupancy rates and rents at redeveloped properties, which may result in our investment not being profitable; (iv) the potential that we may expend funds and management time, or fail to recover expenses already incurred, if we do not complete projects already started or abandon development or redevelopment opportunities after we begin to explore them; (v) the inability to complete leasing of a property on schedule or at all, resulting in an increase in carrying or development or redevelopment costs; (vi) the possibility that properties will be leased at below expected rental rates and (vii) to the extent the development or redevelopment activities are conducted in partnership with third parties, the possibility of disputes with our joint venture partners and the potential that we miss certain project management deadlines.In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, or satisfactory tax rates, incentives or abatements. Operators of new facilities we construct may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third-party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use 38and the necessary provider agreements or contracts. We have experienced such delays in obtaining necessary licensing for constructed properties and may experience additional or more significant delays in the future.We rely on our development managers, general contractors and subcontractors to oversee and manage day-to-day construction activities. If any such party underperforms or experiences financial or other problems during the construction process, we could experience significant delays, increased costs to complete the project and/or other negative impacts to our expected returns and may need to exercise contractual remedies against such party, which may include termination of the applicable underlying service contract. In the event such termination occurs mid-construction, we would likely need to engage a new service provider, which would likely result in additional costs and delays as the transition between providers occurs.The above-described factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may abandon opportunities we have begun to investigate, for a range of reasons, including changes in expected financing or construction costs, adverse changes in expected rents or expenses, adverse environmental and/or geotechnical findings, conditions to zoning approval, legal and regulatory hurdles, including moratoriums on development and redevelopment activities, changes in market and economic conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events; damage, vandalism or accidents, higher requirements for capital improvements; decreased demand due to competition or other market and economic conditions, or defects that we do not discover through the inspection processes, which would result in additional expenses beyond those originally expected. In addition, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities. We may not be able to complete construction and lease-up of a property on budget and on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial performance. Bank failures or other events affecting financial institutions could have a material adverse effect on our and our operators' and tenants' liquidity, results of operations and financial conditionThe failure of a bank, or events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets impacting financial institutions, or concerns or rumors about such events, may adversely impact us, either directly or through an adverse impact on our tenants, operators and borrowers. A bank failure or other event affecting financial institutions could lead to disruptions in our or our tenants', operators' and borrowers' access to bank deposits or borrowing capacity, including access to letters of credit from certain of our tenants relating to lease obligations. In addition, our or our tenants', operators' and borrowers' deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits may not be backstopped by the U.S. government, and banks or financial institutions with which we or our tenants, operators and borrowers do business may be unable to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis. Any adverse effects to our tenants', operators' or borrowers' liquidity or financial performance could affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change, which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, unanticipated costs associated with evacuation, a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property We maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods, as well as the effects of climate change. For example, in 2023, the weather phenomenon known as El Niño returned. This phenomenon generally results in an increase in storms, flooding and landslides in Southern California, heavier precipitation along the Gulf of Mexico and an increase in severe weather in Florida. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including the costs associated with evacuation. Moreover, an increase in volatility and difficulty predicting adverse weather events, such as the changes in tornado patterns in recent years, may result in additional losses. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property. In addition, we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss. Also, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.39To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material, including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations.We may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial conditionUnder various laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. We may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information and legal liabilityOur business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity, attempts to interrupt our access to, or use of information technology systems through distributed denial-of-service or ransomware attacks, breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources, and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents within our environment or our business partners' environments, including those resulting from human error, product defects and technology failures. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our business partners' information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks. Our information technology networks, and those of our business partners are important enablers to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing or detecting a cyber-attack. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures, or respond, mitigate the risks from and recover from an attack without operational impact, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. We regularly defend against, respond to and mitigate risks from cybersecurity breaches, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our or our critical business partners’ business, damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation expense and expose us to legal or regulatory claims or proceedings, including enforcement actions under data privacy or disclosure regulations. Evolving privacy regulations could expose our business to reputational harm and lossesRegulatory authorities around the world have implemented or are considering implementing a number of legislative changes or regulations concerning data protection, which have required or may require us to incur additional expenses and may expose us to additional risks. We and our operators and managers are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients, residents and/or employees, including U.S. federal and state laws (including the CCPA and HIPAA), and non-U.S. laws, such as the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation and the E.U. GDPR, which impose a number of obligations on us. These obligations vary from state to state and country to country, but generally have accountability and transparency requirements. Some jurisdictions (including the EU and U.K.) impose restrictions on transfers of data from their jurisdictions to jurisdictions that they do not consider adequate. This may have implications for our cross-border data flows and may result in additional compliance costs.Many jurisdictions assess fines, the magnitude of which may depend on the annual global revenue of the company and the nature, gravity and duration of, the violation. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, data subjects may have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses. Complying with these laws may cause us or our operators and managers to incur substantial operational and compliance costs or require us to change our business practices. Despite efforts to bring our practices into compliance with these laws, we or our operators and managers may not be successful either due to internal or 40external factors such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of cooperation among our business partners. Such laws may be interpreted and applied differently depending on the jurisdiction and continue to evolve, making it difficult to predict how they may develop and apply to us. Non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with laws, contractual agreements or industry standards could result in scrutiny or proceedings against us by governmental entities, regulators, our business partners, residents of our communities, data subjects, suppliers, vendors or other parties. Further, there is a risk that compliance measures we undertake will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within our business or those of our business partners will not be fully compliant with legal obligations. If there are breaches of these measures, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions, as well as reputational damage, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.ESG-related commitments and expectations expose us to numerous risksWe have made, and expect to continue to make, commitments and disclosures related to ESG initiatives and goals. Statements related to ESG goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters, including emissions, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our ESG goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. Investors and other stakeholders have become increasingly focused on understanding how companies address a variety of ESG factors. Investors may consider a company's ESG-related business practices, scores and reporting, including the company's disclosures and ESG rating systems developed by third parties, as they evaluate investment decisions. The criteria used in these rating systems may conflict and change frequently, and we cannot predict how these third parties will score us, nor can we have any assurance that they score us or other companies accurately. We supplement our participation in ratings systems with published disclosures of our ESG activities, but some investors may desire other disclosures that we do not provide. Failure to participate in certain of the third-party ratings systems, score well in third-party rating systems or provide certain ESG disclosures could result in reputational harm when investors compare us to other companies, and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our common stock, which could adversely affect our stock price. Our business may also face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our ESG activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected.At the same time, some stakeholders and regulators have expressed or pursued contrary views, legislation, and investment expectations with respect to ESG ratings and commitments, including the enactment or proposal of “anti-ESG” legislation or policies, which may expose us to additional legal or reputational risks based upon our ESG commitments and disclosures.Our success and the success of our operators and managers depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed Our success and the success of our operators and managers depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including executive officers and other highly qualified employees, and competition for their talents is intense. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Losing any key personnel could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our operators and managers', financial position and results of operations. Welltower is a holding company with no direct operations, and it relies on funds received from Welltower OP to pay its obligations and make distributions to stockholdersWelltower is a holding company with no direct operations. All of Welltower's property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through Welltower OP and Welltower has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in Welltower OP. As a result, Welltower relies on distributions from Welltower OP to make dividend payments and meet its obligations, including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to Welltower from Welltower OP. Welltower exercises exclusive control over Welltower OP, including the authority to cause Welltower OP to make distributions, subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of Welltower OP's other members as described in the Limited Liability Agreement. In addition, because Welltower is a holding company, your claims as stockholders are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations to preferred equity holders of Welltower OP and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization of Welltower OP or its subsidiaries, assets of Welltower OP or the applicable subsidiary will be available to satisfy any claims of our stockholders only after such liabilities and obligations have been satisfied in full.41Welltower is the initial member and majority owner of Welltower OP, with an approximate ownership interest of 99.765% as of December 31, 2023. In connection with our future acquisition activities or otherwise, Welltower OP may issue additional Class A Common Units (""OP Units"") to third parties and admit additional members. Such issuances would reduce Welltower's percentage ownership in Welltower OP.Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure We may become more leveraged Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies or (5) make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.Cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors If cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise, we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. Our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. All distributions are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with Delaware law and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available to us, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions under Delaware law and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Additionally, our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein, or other significant adverse events, occur. We are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitmentsWe cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions; the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of our common stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; uncertainty from the transition to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") or any other interest rate benchmark; and default or delay in payment by the U.S. of its obligations. We also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. If our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders.Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capitalWe plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, the trading/redemption price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders.42Increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cost of capital, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effectiveThe current high interest rate environment has been increasing interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt.  Such increases in the cost of capital, and any further increases resulting from future interest rate hikes, could adversely impact our ability to finance operations, acquire and develop properties, and refinance existing debt. Specifically, rate increases have corresponding impacts to our costs of borrowing and may have adverse impacts on our ability to raise funds through the offering of our securities or through the issuance of debt due to higher debt capital costs, diminished credit availability and less favorable equity markets. Additionally, increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets, limiting our ability to sell existing assets. Higher interest rates may also lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could result in increased capitalization rates, which may lead to reduced valuation of our assets.We may from time to time seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements, which involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs, and that these arrangements may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline. Developing and implementing an interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be effective. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT We intend to operate as a REIT under the Code, and believe we have operated and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because:•Welltower would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;•Welltower would be subject to increased state and local taxes; and•unless Welltower is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, it could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which it was disqualified. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains with respect to distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Failure of Welltower OP to maintain status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposesWe believe Welltower OP qualifies as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, Welltower OP is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of the partners is allocated its share of Welltower OP's income. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not challenge the status of Welltower OP as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of Welltower OP as a partnership, it would be taxable as a corporation. In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that Welltower OP could make. The treatment of Welltower OP as a corporation would also cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. This would substantially reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the return on a unitholder and/or shareholder's investment.Certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REITWe own interests in a number of entities which intend to operate as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes (each a “Subsidiary REIT”). To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under the Code, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. Provided that each Subsidiary 43REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in the Subsidiary REITs will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. If a Subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT would be subject to federal and state income taxes and would not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified. Any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions and pay any tax required by such relief provisions. The tax imposed on any net income from ""prohibited transactions"" may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposesAny net income of a REIT from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than dispositions of foreclosure property) is subject to a 100% tax, unless certain safe harbor exceptions apply. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business (other than through a TRS), such characterizations is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.The 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. Our use of TRSs is limited under the CodeUnder the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’ operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. Also, our TRSs may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our TRSs that are not on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with our TRSs are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.The lease of qualified health care properties to a TRS is subject to special requirementsWe lease certain qualified health care properties to TRSs (or subsidiaries of TRSs), which lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. The rents from this TRS lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arm's-length lease of a qualified health care property with a TRS and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. If certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the IRS as “true leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences We have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the IRS, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. 44We could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. Longstanding international norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us, thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If we were subject to review or examination by the IRS or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes, the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected.The present federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The federal income tax rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation and REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions might affect our investors or us. Revisions in tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us, could require us to pay additional taxes on our assets or income and/or be subject to additional restrictions, could cause us to change our investments and commitments, and could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. These changes could, among other things, adversely affect the trading price for our common stock, our financial condition, our results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.The impact to our TRSs of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax imposed by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is uncertain and may be adverseFor tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") imposes among other things, a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (""Corporate AMT"") on certain U.S. corporations with average adjusted financial statement income in excess of $1 billion. Although, by its terms, the Corporate AMT is not applicable to REITs, it is not certain whether or how the Corporate AMT would apply to our TRSs.The IRS has issued a number of rulings indicating its intention to propose regulations providing guidance regarding the Corporate AMT and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Until further regulations and guidance from the IRS and Treasury are released, the impact of the Corporate AMT on our TRSs is uncertain and it is possible that our TRSs will be subject to material U.S. federal income taxes under the Corporate AMT"

The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face: our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. We group these risk factors into three categories:•Risks arising from our business;•Risks arising from our capital structure; and•Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our BusinessOur investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations Some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations. Investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all. We may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. We have experienced delays and disruptions to property redevelopment as a result of supply chain issues and construction material and labor shortages and may experience additional or more significant such delays in the future. We also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities and may lead to impairment of such assets. 31Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilityWe may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include: liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for propertiesIn order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns, we seek to reinvest cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities, principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties, including non-elective dispositions in a timely manner. We face competition for acquisition opportunities from other well-capitalized investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors. In addition, limited development during the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the number of new properties becoming available. This competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors and, even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.Our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations, and disputes between us and our partners We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities, including our 85/15 joint venture with Integra Healthcare Properties. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture; that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests; and that our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest and risks to our REIT status. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell, put right or forced sale arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, acquire our partner’s interest or sell the underlying asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. On the other hand, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited and/or valued lower than fair market value. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property.We assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionWe have entered into various joint ventures that were structured under the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”), which permits REITs to own or partially own “qualified health care properties” in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations (as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments) in compliance with REIT requirements. A “qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients.Under a RIDEA structure, we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property, including complying with laws and providing resident care. However, as the owner of the property under a RIDEA structure, we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property, including, those relating to employment matters of our operators, compliance with health care fraud and abuse and other laws, governmental reimbursement matters, compliance with federal, state, local and industry-related licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards, and litigation involving our properties or residents/patients, even though we have limited ability to control or influence our operators’ management of these risks. Further, our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) is generally required to hold the applicable health care license and enroll in the applicable government health care programs (e.g., Medicare- and Medicaid), which subjects us to potential liability under various health care laws. Penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws may include loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need, certification or accreditation, exclusion from government health care programs (e.g., Medicare and 32Medicaid), administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties. Although we have some general oversight approval rights and the right to review operational and financial reporting information, our operators are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the property, including clinical decision-making, and we rely on them to operate the properties in a manner that complies with applicable law.We are exposed to operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operationsWe are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. In addition to operational challenges that continue to impact us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, these risks include fluctuations in occupancy experienced during the normal course of business, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions; the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise); competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; increases in property taxes; state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and federal and state housing laws and regulations, including rent and eviction restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations and could eventually lead to impairment of our properties.We have rights to terminate our management agreements with operators, in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace operators if our management agreements are terminated or not renewedWe are party to long-term management agreements with our Seniors Housing Operating managers pursuant to which they provide comprehensive property management, accounting and other services with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. We have the ability to  terminate any of our management agreements upon the occurrence of certain events such as insolvency relating to such manager, and in some cases, the failure to meet specific NOI targets without curing, as well as the occurrence of other events or certain conditions.   We regularly monitor and review our rights and remedies under our management agreements. When determining if we will take significant action under those agreements, including terminating a manager, we consider numerous legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant factors. In exercising our rights to terminate or not renew a management agreement, we would work with our existing seniors housing operators or potentially new operators to manage the properties; however, there is no assurance that we would be able to timely source a replacement or that any replacement manager would be effective. Any transition to a new manager would most likely require regulatory approval and potentially the approval of the holders of any liens on the property. The failure to replace on a timely basis, as well as the failure to receive these approvals, either at all or in a timely manner, could have an adverse effect on the properties and our revenue.  Decreases in our operators’ or tenants' revenues or increases in our operators’ or tenants' expenses, including as a result of increased labor costs, could affect their ability to make payments to usWe have very limited control over the success or failure of our operators' or tenants' businesses and, at any time, an operator or tenant may experience a downturn in their business that weakens their financial condition. Our operators’ and tenants' revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses are primarily driven by the costs of labor, supplies, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating and borrowing costs have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, for our operators and tenants. In particular, our operators' and tenants' businesses have experienced increases in labor costs resulting from shortages of medical and non-medical staff. A number of factors have adversely affected the labor force available to our operators and tenants or labor costs, including increased industry competition, high employment levels, increased wages offered by other employers, and government regulations. In many geographic areas the scarcity of specialized medical personnel, experienced senior care professionals and other workers has been a significant operating issue affecting a wide range of healthcare providers and senior care and housing facilities. Such shortages have and may continue to impact the operations of our operators and tenants, resulting in increased labor and operating costs. Continued labor shortages or cost inflation may impact our operators' and tenants' abilities to comply with minimum staffing requirements under applicable federal and state regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements can, among other things, jeopardize a facility's compliance with the conditions of participation under relevant state and federal healthcare programs. In addition, if a facility is determined to be out of compliance with these requirements, it may be subject to fines and other regulatory penalties, including the suspension of patient admissions, the termination of Medicaid participation or the suspension or revocation of licenses. To the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in an operator or tenant not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator or tenant and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results. These risks are magnified where we lease multiple properties to a 33single operator or tenant under a master lease, as a failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. Although our lease agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.Increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ and managers' ability to meet their obligations to us The operators and managers of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators and managers of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients, including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price, and location. In addition, in light of labor shortages for medical and non-medical workers in many geographic areas, our operators and tenants increasingly compete to attract qualified and experienced employees. Our operators and managers are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents and employees or expand their businesses. In addition, we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities. We cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that meet our expected yields and fulfill their obligations to us. If our operators and managers cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities, their financial performance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.A severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net propertiesOur business and operations were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are exposed to risks from COVID-19, severe cold and flu seasons or the occurrence of other epidemics or other widespread illnesses. Our revenues and our operators' revenues are dependent on occupancy and the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, a resurgence of COVID-19 or other widespread illness. Such a decrease would affect the operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make payments to us. As we experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, a future flu or other pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators, including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents or see a reduction in occupancy, and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. The COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse effects on our business, operations and financial condition, including:•a decline in spot occupancy in our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio from 85.8% at February 29, 2020 to the pandemic-low of 72.6% on March 12, 2021 and a possibility of continued decline, which could affect the net operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make contractual payments to us;•increased operational costs incurred by us and our operators across all of our properties as a result of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties and operations, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators and tenants, unique pressures on seniors housing and medical practice employees during the COVID-19 pandemic including labor shortages resulting from macroeconomic trends, decreased employee morale and productivity as a result of difficult conditions and stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher operator and tenant cost of insurance and such insurance may not cover certain claims related to COVID-19; and•increased operational challenges and costs resulting from logistical challenges such as supply chain interruptions, business closures, restrictions on the movement of people and remote or hybrid work schedules, which adversely impact employee productivity and morale and introduce additional operations risk, including cybersecurity risks.We remain subject to a number of other risks relating to COVID-19, including a decline in the rental income in our Outpatient Medical segment if our tenants do not renew leases or do not make timely or full lease payments as a result of medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures or decisions by patients to delay treatments; concessions such as rent deferrals or rent abatements that we may offer certain tenants across our Triple-net and Outpatient Medical segments; and our increased exposure to COVID-19 related litigation and publicity risks if the operators or tenants of the relevant facilities are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency.Although the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided from its peaks, any resurgence of the pandemic, outbreaks of new variants, changes in the effectiveness of vaccines, boosters and treatments, and adoptions of new public health measures may reintroduce the risks relating to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us. Additionally, there remains uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of COVID-19 relief legislation, such as the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, and possible government audits and investigations related to our receipt and use of such relief funds.34The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, which may result in a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. The properties managed by Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (“Sunrise”) account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us As of December 31, 2022, Sunrise managed 109 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income. Under our management agreements, we rely on Sunrise’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our Seniors Housing Operating properties efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, we depend on Sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. A shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force Sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. Any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by Sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in Sunrise’s senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our Seniors Housing Operating properties and have a material adverse effect on us. Also, if Sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could result in, among other things, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we determine to sell or transition properties currently managed by Sunrise, we may experience operational challenges and/or significantly declining financial performance for those properties.Ownership of property outside the U.S. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations We have operations in the U.K. and Canada which represent 9.5% and 7.9% of total Welltower revenues, respectively.  As of December 31, 2022, Revera managed 78 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties in Canada, representing a significant portion of our revenues in Canada, and also owned a controlling interest in Sunrise. International development, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, any international currency gain or loss recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates, which may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test required for us to satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants' supply chain and consumer spending levels; changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions (regionally, nationally and locally) including, challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in foreign countries; local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign 35lenders to provide financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political and economic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Further, our operations in the U.K. may be adversely impacted by global and local economic volatility experienced as a result of geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, rising inflation and interest rates, the energy crisis that has seen supply shortages and higher oil, gas and electricity prices, labor market challenges affecting the recruitment and retention of employees.If our tenants do not renew their existing leases, or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons, we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms, or at allWe cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties, or sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire. In addition, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms.Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator, economic and other conditions will be limited. Although our properties are less affected by the commercial real estate market trends, this limitation could be exacerbated by the current decline of commercial real estate as a result of high interest rates, inflation and declining property values across sectors. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Our tenants, operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses We maintain or require our tenants, operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. Our tenants, operators and managers may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages. Also, we may not be able to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements, which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss. We cannot make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. Insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or policies may not be maintained at a level that will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. This may be especially the case due to increases in property insurance costs. In addition, in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets. Due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ future operations, cash flows and financial conditions, and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us. Finally, our use, and the usage by some of our tenants, operators and managers of self-insurance and/or use of a wholly owned captive insurance company, if not adequately funded, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and that of our tenants, operators and managers.Our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. Many of these ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.36The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us Some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, change-of-ownership rules, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), any lapse in Congressional funding of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. Federal and state authorities may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Reimbursement” above for additional information. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us. In addition, if a partial or total federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time, federal government payment obligations, including its obligations under Medicaid and Medicare, may be delayed. Similarly, if state government shutdowns were to occur, state payment obligations may be delayed. If the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis, our business could suffer, and our financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected.Since January 1, 2014, the Health Reform Laws have provided those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise ineligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. The federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion and as of December 2022, the number of states implementing expansion has grown to more than 75% of all states. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants. The status of the Health Reform Laws may be subject to change and other health reform measures could be implemented as a result of political, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. Further the impact that the recent change of control of the House and future changes in the federal government may have on health reform (including through new legislative, executive or regulatory efforts) remains uncertain, and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Health Reform Laws. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. More generally, and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business, or that of our operators and tenants. If controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our health care facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affectedControls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization reviews,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our health care facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required pre-admission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide health care services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. If so, this could adversely affect these tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and/or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us.37Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us Our operators and tenants generally are subject to or impacted by varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards. These laws and regulations include, among others: laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices; laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business, such as fire, health and safety, data security and privacy laws; federal and state laws affecting hospitals, clinics and other health care communities that participate in both Medicare and Medicaid that specify reimbursement rates, pricing, reimbursement procedures and limitations, quality of services and care, background checks, food service and physical plants, and similar foreign laws regulating the health care industry; resident rights laws (including abuse and neglect laws) and fraud laws; anti-kickback and physician referral laws; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or similar foreign agencies. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs, civil liability, and in certain limited instances, criminal penalties, material restrictions on or loss of license, closure of the facility and/or the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action. The likelihood of these actions may increase due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. In addition, we may be directly subject to these laws, regulations and standards, as well as potential investigation or enforcement, as a result of our RIDEA-structured arrangements, and certain other arrangements we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to these laws. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Fraud & Abuse Enforcement” and “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Health Care Matters - Generally” above.Many of our properties may require a license, registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. In addition, we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the health care industry, including our tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants and operators will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor cost levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us.Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionFrom time to time, we are directly involved or named as a party in in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims that involve class actions, disputes regarding property damage, care matters and other issues. We also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. Employment related class action lawsuits have increased in recent years, including class action lawsuits brought against our operators in certain states regarding employee and government requirements regarding wage and hour claims and fair housing complaints, as well as class action lawsuits related to COVID-19. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses, significantly divert the attention of management, and could damage our reputation and our brand. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business. We cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage.Development, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitabilityWe invest in various development and redevelopment projects. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected construction costs, lease up velocity, occupancy, rental rates, operating expenses, capital costs and future competition. If our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate, the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. 38Our development/redevelopment and construction projects are vulnerable to the impact of material shortages and inflation. For example, shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials have resulted in and could continue to result in delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our projects. Pricing for labor and raw materials can be affected by various national, regional, local, economic and political factors, including changes to immigration laws that impact the availability of labor or tariffs on imported construction materials. In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, or satisfactory tax rates, incentives or abatements. Operators of new facilities we construct may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third-party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts. We have experienced such delays in obtaining necessary licensing for constructed properties and may experience additional or more significant delays in the future.We rely on our development managers, general contractors and subcontractors to oversee and manage day-to-day construction activities. If any such party underperforms or experiences financial or other problems during the construction process, we could experience significant delays, increased costs to complete the project and/or other negative impacts to our expected returns and may need to exercise contractual remedies against such party, which may include termination of the applicable underlying service contract. In the event such termination occurs mid-construction, we would likely need to engage a new service provider, which would likely result in additional costs and delays as the transition between providers occurs.The above-described factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may abandon opportunities we have begun to investigate, for a range of reasons, including changes in expected financing or construction costs, adverse changes in expected rents or expenses, adverse environmental and/or geotechnical findings, conditions to zoning approval, legal and regulatory hurdles, including moratoriums on development and redevelopment activities, changes in market and economic conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events; damage, vandalism or accidents, higher requirements for capital improvements; decreased demand due to competition or other market and economic conditions, or defects that we do not discover through the inspection processes, which would result in additional expenses beyond those originally expected. In addition, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities. We may not be able to complete construction and lease-up of a property on budget and on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial performance. We may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change, which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, unanticipated costs associated with evacuation, a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property We maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods, as well as the effects of climate change. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including the costs associated with evacuation. Moreover, an increase in volatility and difficulty predicting adverse weather events, such as the changes in tornado patterns in recent years, may result in additional losses. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property. In addition, we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss. Also, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.39To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material, including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income.We may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial conditionUnder various laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. We may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information and legal liabilityOur business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity, attempts to interrupt our access to, or use of information technology systems through distributed denial-of-service or ransomware attacks, breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources, and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents within our environment or our business partners' environments, including those resulting from human error, product defects and technology failures. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our business partners' information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks. Our information technology networks, and those of our business partners are essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing or detecting a cyber-attack. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures, or respond, mitigate the risks from and recover from an attack without operational impact, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. We regularly defend against, respond to and mitigate risks from cybersecurity breaches, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our or our critical business partners’ business, damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary, personal identifying or confidential information of our employees, operators, tenants and partners, or result in operational disruptions, could result in legal claims or proceedings, including enforcement actions by regulators under data privacy regulations.Evolving privacy regulations could expose our business to reputational harm and lossesRegulatory authorities around the world have implemented or are considering implementing a number of legislative changes or regulations concerning data protection, which have required or may require us to incur additional expenses and may expose us to additional risks. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients or employees, including U.S. federal and state laws (including the State of California and HIPAA), and non- U.S. laws, such as the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation and the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which impose a number of obligations on us. These obligations vary from state to state and country to country, but generally have accountability and transparency including consent, detailed information and data removal and security requirements. Some jurisdictions impose the same requirements and restrictions on transfers of data from their jurisdictions to jurisdictions that they do not consider adequate. This may have implications for our cross-border data flows and may result in additional compliance costs.40Many jurisdictions assess fines, the magnitude of which may depend on the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, the nature, gravity and duration of, and the violation. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, data subjects may have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses. Complying with these laws may cause us to incur substantial operational and compliance costs or require us to change our business practices. Despite efforts to bring our practices into compliance with these laws, we may not be successful either due to internal or external factors such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of cooperation among our business partners. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, regulators, our business partners, residents of our communities, data subjects, suppliers, vendors or other parties. Further, there is a risk that compliance measures we undertake will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within our business or that of our business partners will not be fully compliant with the new procedures. If there are breaches of these measures, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions, as well as reputational damage, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.Our success and the success of our operators and managers depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed Our success and the success of our operators and managers depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including executive officers and other highly qualified employees, and competition for their talents is intense. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Losing any key personnel could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our operators and managers', financial position and results of operations. Welltower is a holding company with no direct operations, and it relies on funds received from Welltower OP to pay its obligations and make distributions to stockholdersWelltower is a holding company with no direct operations. All of Welltower's property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through Welltower OP and Welltower has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in Welltower OP. As a result, Welltower relies on distributions from Welltower OP to make dividend payments and meet its obligations, including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to Welltower from Welltower OP. Welltower exercises exclusive control over Welltower OP, including the authority to cause Welltower OP to make distributions, subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of Welltower OP's other members as described in the Limited Liability Agreement. In addition, because Welltower is a holding company, your claims as stockholders are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations to preferred equity holders of Welltower OP and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization of Welltower OP or its subsidiaries, assets of Welltower OP or the applicable subsidiary will be available to satisfy any claims of our stockholders only after such liabilities and obligations have been satisfied in full.Welltower is the initial member and majority owner of Welltower OP, with an approximate ownership interest of 99.751% as of December 31, 2022. In connection with our future acquisition activities or otherwise, Welltower OP may issue additional Class A Common Units (""OP Units"") to third parties and admit additional members. Such issuances would reduce Welltower's percentage ownership in Welltower OP.Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure We may become more leveraged Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies or (5) make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.Cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors If cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise, we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. Our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. All distributions are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with Delaware law and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available to us, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual 41arrangements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions under Delaware law and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Additionally, our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein, or other significant adverse events, occur. We are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitmentsWe cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions; the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of our common stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; uncertainty from the transition to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") or any other interest rate benchmark; and default or delay in payment by the U.S. of its obligations. We also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. If our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders.Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capitalWe plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, the trading/redemption price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders.Increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cost of capital, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effectiveThe current high interest rate environment has been increasing interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt.  Such increases in the cost of capital, and any further increases resulting from future interest rate hikes, could adversely impact our ability to finance operations, acquire and develop properties, and refinance existing debt. Additionally, increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets, limiting our ability to sell existing assets. Higher interest rates may also lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could result in increased capitalization rates, which may lead to reduced valuation of our assets.We may from time to time seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements, which involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs, and that these arrangements may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline. Developing and implementing an interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be effective. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT We intend to operate as a REIT under the Code, and believe we have operated and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because:42•Welltower would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;•Welltower would be subject to increased state and local taxes; and•unless Welltower is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, it could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which it was disqualified. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains with respect to distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Failure of Welltower OP to maintain status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposesWe believe Welltower OP qualifies as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, Welltower OP is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of the partners is allocated its share of Welltower OP's income. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not challenge the status of Welltower OP as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of Welltower OP as a partnership, it would be taxable as a corporation. In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that Welltower OP could make. The treatment of Welltower OP as a corporation would also cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. This would substantially reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the return on a unitholder and/or shareholder's investment.Certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REITWe own interests in a number of entities which intend to operate as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes (each a “Subsidiary REIT”). To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under the Code, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. Provided that each Subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in the Subsidiary REITs will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. If a Subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT would be subject to federal and state income taxes and would not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified. Any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions. The tax imposed on any net income from ""prohibited transactions"" may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposesAny net income of a REIT from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than dispositions of foreclosure property) is subject to a 100% tax, unless certain safe harbor exceptions apply. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business (other than through a TRS), such characterizations is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.The 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we deem 43it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. Our use of TRSs is limited under the CodeUnder the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’ operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. Also, our TRSs may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our TRSs that are not on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with our TRSs are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.The lease of qualified health care properties to a TRS is subject to special requirementsWe lease certain qualified health care properties to TRSs (or subsidiaries of TRSs), which lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. The rents from this TRS lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arm's-length lease of a qualified health care property with a TRS and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. If certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as “true leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences We have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the IRS, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. We could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. Longstanding international norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us, thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If we were subject to review or examination by the IRS or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes, the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected.The present federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The federal income tax rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation and REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions might affect our investors or us. Revisions in tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us, could cause us to change our investments and commitments, and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.44The impact to our TRSs of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax imposed by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is uncertain and may be adverseFor tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") imposes among other things, a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (""Corporate AMT"") on certain U.S. corporations with average adjusted financial statement income in excess of $1 billion. Although, by its terms, the Corporate AMT is not applicable to REITs, it is not certain whether or how the Corporate AMT would apply to our TRSs.In December 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued Notice 2023-7, indicating its intention to propose regulations and provide other guidance regarding the Corporate AMT and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Until further regulations and guidance from the IRS and Treasury are released, the impact of the Corporate AMT on our TRSs is uncertain and it is possible that our TRSs will be subject to material U.S. federal income taxes under the Corporate AMT"

Risk Factor SummaryThe following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in our company speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described in the Risk Factors
 section below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors
 section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business.

Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT As a result of our status as a REIT, we are exposed to risks, including those related to:•our ability to remain qualified as a REIT;•the ability of our subsidiaries to qualify as a REIT;•the impact of the 90% annual distribution requirement on our liquidity and ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions;•our limited use of TRSs under the Code;•special requirements applicable to the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary;•tax consequences if certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the IRS as “true leases; and•changes in our tax rate or exposure to additional tax liabilities.Risks FactorsThis section highlights significant factors, events and uncertainties that could create risk with an investment in our securities. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face: our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. We group these risk factors into three categories:•Risks arising from our business;•Risks arising from our capital structure; and•Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our BusinessThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous factors that are not within our control. These factors include the duration and severity of the outbreak, including the impact of new variants; the continued deployment of vaccines and boosters; the effectiveness of vaccines and boosters over time and against new variants; public health measures, such as business closures and stay-at-home orders, and other actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic disruption and uncertainty in key markets and financial market volatility; and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general macroeconomic conditions and the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides.The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks, including but not limited to those discussed below:•Risks Related to Revenue: Our revenues and our operators' revenues are dependent on occupancy. Our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio has experienced a decline in spot occupancy from 85.8% at February 29, 2020 to 76.2% at December 31, 2020 and 77.7% at December 31, 2021. Although the ongoing impact of the pandemic, including new variants, and vaccine and booster deployment on occupancy remain uncertain, occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties could further decrease, including as a result of new variants or decreases in vaccine effectiveness over time. Such a decrease could affect the net operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make contractual payments to us. In addition, 26although we collected virtually all rent due in the fourth quarter of 2021, rental income in our Outpatient Medical segment may decrease if our tenants do not renew leases or do not make timely or full lease payments as a result of medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures or decisions by patients to delay treatments. As a result of the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operators and tenants, we may offer certain tenants concessions such as rent deferrals or rent abatements across our Triple-net and Outpatient Medical segments.•Risks Related to Operator and Tenant Financial Condition: In addition to decreased revenue from tenant and operator payments, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a heightened risk of tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency due to factors such as prolonged decreased occupancy, medical practice disruptions resulting from stay-at-home orders, increased health and safety and labor expenses or litigation resulting from developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. See"" - The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition"" for more information Our ability to terminate our lease with a tenant or management agreement with an operator or manager, and relet the property to another tenant or transition to a new operator or manager may be severely limited under current conditions due to the industry and macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and local ordinances. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, operator or manager due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about an operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings, particularly in light of ongoing publicity related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Additionally, COVID-19 claims have been excluded from insurance policies resulting in uninsured claims, and there has been an increase of COVID-19 class action lawsuits filed that may result in unfavorable verdicts. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. •Risks Related to Operations: Across all of our properties, we and our operators and tenants have incurred increased operational costs as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties and operations, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators and tenants related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to efforts to procure PPE and supplies. Such operational costs may increase in the future based on the duration and severity of the pandemic or the introduction of additional public health regulations. In addition, operators and tenants are subject to risks arising from the unique pressures on seniors housing and medical practice employees during the COVID-19 pandemic including labor shortages resulting from macroeconomic trends. As a result of difficult conditions and stresses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, employee morale and productivity may suffer and additional pay, such as hazard pay, may not be sufficient to retain key operator and tenant employees. In addition, our operations or those of our operators or tenants may be adversely impacted if a significant number of our employees or those of our operators or tenants contract COVID-19. Although we continue to undertake extensive efforts to ensure the safety of our employees and residents and to provide operator and tenant support in this regard, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our facilities could result in additional operational costs and reputational and litigation risk to us and our operators and tenants. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operator and tenant cost of insurance is expected to increase and such insurance may not cover certain claims related to COVID-19. Our exposure to COVID-19 related litigation risk may be increased if the operators or tenants of the relevant facilities are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, to varying degrees during the course of the pandemic, we have experienced increased operational challenges and costs resulting from logistical challenges such as supply chain interruptions, business closures and restrictions on the movement of people. In response to stay-at-home orders and to support the health and well-being of our employees, many of our employees are currently working remote or hybrid schedules. The effects of such work arrangements for an extended period of time could impact employee productivity and morale and introduce additional operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks.•Risks Related to Liquidity: If our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets relating to the pandemic, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, a prolonged period of decreased revenue may adversely affect our financial condition and long-term growth prospects and there can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades. Future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of capital, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.27There remains uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and any future stimulus or other COVID-19 relief legislation. There can be no assurance as to the amount of financial assistance we and our operators will receive or that we will be able to comply with the terms and conditions to keep such assistance.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (""PPPHCE Act""), signed into law on March 20, 2020, and April 24, 2020, respectively, authorized $175 billion in funding to be distributed to healthcare providers, including assisted living facilities. These funds, distributed through the Provider Relief Fund and administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, are required to be used to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and reimburse expenses or lost revenues attributable the COVID-19 pandemic. Although these distributions are not subject to repayment, attestation and compliance with certain terms and conditions including detailed reporting and auditing are required. Any funds that are ultimately received and retained by us are not expected to fully offset the losses incurred in our senior living portfolio that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received government grants under the CARES Act primarily to cover increased expenses and lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as under similar programs in the U.K. and Canada. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we recognized $102,575,000 and $34,941,000, respectively, of government grant income. We have completed applications for grant income under Phase 4 of the Provider Relief Fund and expect to receive additional funding during 2022. However, there can be no assurances that all of our applications will be approved or that additional funds will ultimately be received in full or in part.Our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations Some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations. Investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all. We may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. We have experienced delays and disruptions to property redevelopment as a result of supply chain issues and construction material and labor shortages and may experience additional or more significant such delays in the future. We also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities and may lead to impairment of such assets. Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilityWe may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include: liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for propertiesWe may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other well-capitalized investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors. This competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors and, even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.28Our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations, and disputes between us and our partners We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture; that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests; and that our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest and risks to our REIT status. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell, put right or forced sale arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, acquire our partner’s interest or sell the underlying asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. On the other hand, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited and/or valued lower than fair market value. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property.We assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionWe have entered into various joint ventures that were structured under the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”), which permits REITs to own or partially own “qualified health care properties” in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations (as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments) in compliance with REIT requirements. A “qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients.Under a RIDEA structure, we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property, including complying with laws and providing resident care. However, as the owner of the property under a RIDEA structure, we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property, including, but not limited to, those relating to employment matters of our operators, compliance with health care fraud and abuse and other laws, governmental reimbursement matters, compliance with federal, state, local and industry-related licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards, and litigation involving our properties or residents/patients, even though we have limited ability to control or influence our operators’ management of these risks. Further, our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) is generally required to hold the applicable health care license and enroll in the applicable government health care programs (e.g., Medicare- and Medicaid), which subjects us to potential liability under various health care regulatory laws. Penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws may include loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need, certification or accreditation, exclusion from government health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties. Although we have some general oversight approval rights and the right to review operational and financial reporting information, our operators are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the property, including clinical decision-making, and we rely on them to operate the properties in a manner that complies with applicable law.We are exposed to operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operationsWe are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. In addition to operational challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, these risks include fluctuations in occupancy experienced during the normal course of business, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; increases in property taxes; state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; federal and state housing laws and regulations, including rent and eviction restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations and could eventually lead to impairment of our properties.29We have rights to terminate our management agreements with operators, in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace if our management agreements are terminated or not renewedWe are parties to long-term management agreements with our Seniors Housing Operating managers pursuant to which they provide comprehensive property management, accounting and other services with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. We have the ability to  terminate any of our management agreements upon the occurrence of certain events such as insolvency relating to such manager, and in some cases, the failure to meet specific NOI targets without curing, as well as the occurrence of other events or certain conditions.   We regularly monitor and review our rights and remedies under our management agreements. When determining if we will take significant action under those agreements, including terminating a manager, we consider numerous legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant factors. In exercising our rights to terminate or not renew a management agreement, we would work with our existing seniors housing operators or potentially new operators to manage the properties; however, there is no assurance that we would be able to timely source a replacement or that any replacement manager would be effective. Any transition to a new manager would most likely require regulatory approval and potentially the approval of the holders of any liens on the property. The failure to replace on a timely basis, as well as the failure to receive these approvals, either at all or in a timely manner, could have an adverse effect on the properties and our revenue.  Decreases in our operators’ or tenants' revenues or increases in our operators’ or tenants' expenses, including as a result of increased labor costs, could affect their ability to make payments to usWe have very limited control over the success or failure of our operators' or tenants' businesses and, at any time, an operator or tenant may experience a downturn in their business that weakens their financial condition. Our operators’ and tenants' revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses are primarily driven by the costs of labor, supplies, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating costs continue to increase for our operators and tenants. In particular, our operators' and tenants' businesses are vulnerable to increases in labor costs resulting from shortages of medical and non-medical staff. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to our operators and tenants or labor costs, including increased industry competition, high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased wages offered by other employers, including in other economic sectors, vaccine mandates and other government regulations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in many geographic areas the lack of availability of specialized medical personnel, experienced senior care professionals and other workers has been a significant operating issue affecting a wide range of healthcare providers and senior care and housing facilities. Such shortages have and may continue to impact the operations of our operators and tenants, resulting in increased labor and operating costs. Continued labor shortages or cost inflation may impact our operators' and tenants' abilities to comply with minimum staffing requirements under applicable federal and state regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements can, among other things, jeopardize a facility's compliance with the conditions of participation under relevant state and federal healthcare programs. In addition, if a facility is determined to be out of compliance with these requirements, it may be subject to fines and other regulatory penalties, including the suspension of patient admissions, the termination of Medicaid participation or the suspension or revocation of licenses. To the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in an operator or tenant not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator or tenant and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results. These risks are magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator or tenant under a master lease, as a failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. Although our lease agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.Increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ and managers' ability to meet their obligations to us The operators and managers of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators and managers of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients, including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price, and location. In addition, in light of labor shortages for medical and non-medical workers in many geographic areas, our operators and tenants increasingly compete to attract qualified and experienced employees. Our operators and managers are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents and employees or expand their businesses. In addition, we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities. We cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that meet our expected yields and fulfill their obligations to us, including but not limited to the results of the COVID-19 pandemic. If our operators and managers cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities, their financial performance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.30A severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net propertiesIn addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business and operations are exposed to risks from severe cold and flu seasons or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses. Our revenues and our operators' revenues are dependent on occupancy and the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness. Such a decrease could affect the operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make payments to us. As experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, a future flu or other pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators, including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents, and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, which may result in a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. We may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us From time to time, we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities, principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties, including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns, we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors, including other health care REITs, real estate partnerships, health care providers, health care lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. This competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us. In addition, our ability to execute on our real estate investment strategies may be temporarily disrupted during periods of financial market volatility or real estate and health care industry market uncertainty, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.The properties managed by Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (“Sunrise”) account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us As of December 31, 2021, Sunrise managed 110 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income. Under our management agreements, we rely on Sunrise’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our Seniors Housing Operating properties efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, we depend on Sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. A shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force Sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. Any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by Sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in Sunrise’s senior management or equity ownership 31could adversely affect the income we receive from our Seniors Housing Operating properties and have a material adverse effect on us. Also, if Sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could result in, among other things, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we determine to sell or transition properties currently managed by Sunrise, we may experience operational challenges and/or significantly declining financial performance for those properties.We depend on ProMedica Health System (""ProMedica"") for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us As of December 31, 2021, we lease 205 properties to ProMedica under triple-net leases, which account for a significant portion of our revenues. We depend on ProMedica to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. We cannot assure you that ProMedica will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by ProMedica to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ProMedica have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that ProMedica will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. ProMedica's failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Ownership of property outside the U.S. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations We have operations in the U.K. and Canada which represent 11.7% and 8.9% of total Welltower revenues, respectively.  As of December 31, 2021, Revera managed 85 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties in Canada, representing a significant portion of our revenues, and also owned a controlling interest in Sunrise. International development, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, any international currency gain or loss recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates, which may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test required for us to satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants' supply chain and consumer spending levels; changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions (regionally, nationally and locally) including, but not limited to, challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in foreign countries; local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political and economic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may subject our international business and that of our operators and tenants to different or greater risks than those faced in the U.S. These factors may include the duration and severity of the outbreak in a particular country due to the impact of new variants, the distribution of vaccines and boosters, or public health measures or other actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic. If our tenants do not renew their existing leases, or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons, we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms, or at allWe cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties, or sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire. In addition, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms.32Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator, economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Our tenants, operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses We maintain or require our tenants, operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. Our tenants, operators and managers may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages. Also, we may not be able to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements, which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss. We cannot make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. Insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or policies may not be maintained at a level that will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. This may be especially the case due to increases in property insurance costs. In addition, in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets. Due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ future operations, cash flows and financial conditions, and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us. Finally, our use, and the usage by some of our tenants, operators and managers of self-insurance and/or use of a wholly owned captive insurance company, if not adequately funded, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and that of our tenants, operators and managers.Our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. Many of these ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us Some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, change-of-ownership rules, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), any lapse in Congressional funding of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. In recent years, government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures. Federal and state authorities may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Reimbursement” above for additional information. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us. Since January 1, 2014, the Health Reform Laws have provided those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of early January 2022, 33more than 75% of the states have expanded Medicaid coverage. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants. While there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws through legislative action and legal challenges, legislative attempts to completely repeal the Health Reform Laws have been unsuccessful to date, and on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the Health Reform Laws brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Health Reform Laws. Nevertheless, the status of the Health Reform Laws may be subject to change and other health reform measures could be implemented as a result of political, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. Further impact that the Biden Administration or U.S. Congress may  have on health reform (including through new legislative, executive order, or regulatory efforts) remains uncertain, and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Health Reform Laws. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. More generally, and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business, or that of our operators and tenants. If controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our health care facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affectedControls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization reviews,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our health care facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required pre-admission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide health care services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. If so, this could adversely affect these tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and/or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us.Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us Our operators and tenants generally are subject to or impacted by varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards. These laws and regulations include, among others: laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices; laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business, such as fire, health and safety, data security and privacy laws; federal and state laws affecting hospitals, clinics and other health care communities that participate in both Medicare and Medicaid that specify reimbursement rates, pricing, reimbursement procedures and limitations, quality of services and care, background checks, food service and physical plants, and similar foreign laws regulating the health care industry; resident rights laws (including abuse and neglect laws) and fraud laws; anti-kickback and physician referral laws; the ADA and similar state and local laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or similar foreign agencies. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs, civil liability, and in certain limited instances, criminal penalties, material restrictions on or loss of license, closure of the facility and/or the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action. The likelihood of these actions may increase due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. In addition, we may be directly subject to these laws, regulations and standards, as well as potential investigation or enforcement, as a result of our RIDEA-structured arrangements, and certain other arrangements we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to these laws. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Fraud & Abuse Enforcement” and “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Health Care Matters - Generally” above.Many of our properties may require a license, registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or other 34similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. In addition, we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the health care industry, including our tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants and operators will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor cost levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us.Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionFrom time to time, we are directly involved or named as a party in in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims that involve class actions, disputes regarding property damage, care matters and other issues. We also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. Employment related class action lawsuits have increased in recent years, including but not limited to class action lawsuits brought against our operators in certain states regarding employee and government requirements regarding wage and hour claims and fair housing complaints, as well as class action lawsuits related to COVID-19. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses, significantly divert the attention of management, and could damage our reputation and our brand. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business. We cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage.Development, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitabilityWe invest in various development and redevelopment projects. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected construction costs, lease up velocity, occupancy, rental rates, operating expenses, capital costs and future competition. If our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate, the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. Our development/redevelopment and construction projects are vulnerable to the impact of material shortages and inflation. For example, shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our projects. Pricing for labor and raw materials can be affected by various national, regional, local, economic and political factors, including changes to immigration laws that impact the availability of labor or tariffs on imported construction materials. In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, or satisfactory tax rates, incentives or abatements. Operators of new facilities we construct may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third-party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts. We have experienced such delays in obtaining necessary licensing for constructed properties and may experience additional or more significant delays in the future.We rely on our development managers, general contractors and subcontractors to oversee and manage day-to-day construction activities. If any such party underperforms, we may need to exercise contractual remedies against such party, which may include termination of the applicable underlying service contract. In the event such termination occurs mid-construction, we would likely need to engage a new service provider, which would likely result in additional costs and delays as the transition between providers occurs.The above-described factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may abandon opportunities we have begun to investigate, for a range of reasons, including changes in expected financing or construction costs, adverse changes in expected rents or expenses, adverse environmental and/or geotechnical findings, or conditions to zoning approval, which would result in additional expenses beyond those originally expected. In addition, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities. We may not be able to complete construction and lease-up of a property on budget and on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development, 35construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial performance. We may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change, which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, unanticipated costs associated with evacuation, a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property We maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods, as well as the effects of climate change. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including but not limited to the costs associated with evacuation. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property. In addition, we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss. Also, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material, including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income.We may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial conditionUnder various laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. We may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information and legal liabilityOur business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity, attempts to interrupt our access to, or use of information technology systems through distributed denial-of-service or ransomware attacks, breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources, and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents within our environment or our business partners' environments, including those resulting from human error, product defects and technology failures. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our business partners' information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks. Our information technology networks, and those of our business partners are essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing or detecting a cyber-attack. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are 36designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures, or respond, mitigate the risks from and recover from an attack without operational impact, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. We regularly defend against, respond to and mitigate risks from cybersecurity breaches, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our or our critical business partners’ business, damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary, personal identifying or confidential information of our employees, operators, tenants and partners, or result in operational disruptions, could result in legal claims or proceedings, including enforcement actions by regulators under data privacy regulations.Evolving privacy regulations could expose our business to reputational harm and lossesRegulatory authorities around the world have implemented or are considering implementing a number of legislative changes or regulations concerning data protection, which have required or may require us to incur additional expenses and may expose us to additional risks. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients or employees, including U.S. federal and state laws (including. but not limited to the State of California), and non- U.S. laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which impose a number of obligations on us. These obligations vary from state to state and country to country, but generally have accountability and transparency including consent, detailed information and data removal and security requirements. Some jurisdictions impose the same requirements and restrictions on transfers of data from their jurisdictions to jurisdictions that they do not consider adequate. This may have implications for our cross-border data flows and may result in additional compliance costs.Many jurisdictions assess fines, the magnitude of which may depend on the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, the nature, gravity and duration of, and the violation. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, data subjects may have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses. Complying with these laws may cause us to incur substantial operational and compliance costs or require us to change our business practices. Despite efforts to bring our practices into compliance with these laws, we may not be successful either due to internal or external factors such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of cooperation among our business partners. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, regulators, our business partners, residents of our communities, data subjects, suppliers, vendors or other parties. Further, there is a risk that compliance measures we undertake will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within our business or that of our business partners will not be fully compliant with the new procedures. If there are breaches of these measures, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions, as well as reputational damage, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.Our success and the success of our operators and managers depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed Our success and the success of our operators and managers depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including executive officers and other highly qualified employees, and competition for their talents is intense. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Losing any key personnel could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our operators and managers', financial position and results of operations. Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure We may become more leveraged Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies or (5) make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt. Cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors If cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise, we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. Our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. All distributions are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with Delaware law and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available to us, our expectation of 37our future capital requirements and operating performance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions under Delaware law and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Additionally, our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein, or other significant adverse events, occur. We are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitmentsWe cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions; the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of our common stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and the transition to any other interest rate benchmark; and default or delay in payment by the U.S. of its obligations. We also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. If our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders.Changes affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may have consequences for us that cannot yet reasonably be predictedWe have outstanding debt, hedge agreements and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In March 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, confirmed that it would cease publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. As a result, the United States Federal Reserve has advised banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Fed, has identified the Second Oversight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") as the recommended alternative rate for LIBOR. While it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether, or to what extent, the withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR would affect us, the implementation of SOFR or other alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact contracts that terminate after 2023. There is uncertainty about how applicable law, the courts or we will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on agreements that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capitalWe plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, the trading/redemption price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders.Increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cost of capitalAn increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt.  Such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations, acquire and develop properties, and refinance existing debt. Additionally, increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets, limiting our ability to sell existing assets.38Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believe we have operated and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because:•we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;•we would be subject to increased state and local taxes; and•unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which we were disqualified. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains with respect to distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REITWe own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes (each a “Subsidiary REIT”). To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under the Code, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. Provided that each Subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in the Subsidiary REITs will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. If a Subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions. The 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. Our use of TRSs is limited under the CodeUnder the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’ operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. Also, our TRSs may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our TRSs that are not on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with our TRSs are on 39arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.The lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirementsWe lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arm's-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. If certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as “true leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences We have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the IRS, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. We could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. Longstanding international norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us, thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If we were subject to review or examination by the IRS or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes, the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected.The present federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The federal income tax rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation and REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions might affect our investors or us. Revisions in tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us, could cause us to change our investments and commitments, and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow"
4,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2021-02-10,"Risk Factors
Risk Factor SummaryThe following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in our company speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described in the Risk Factors
 section below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors
 section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. The order of presentation is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each factor poses to us.Risks Arising from Our Business:Our business model and the operations of our business involve risks, including those related to:•the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;•uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and future stimulus or other COVID-19 relief legislation;•investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties;•unknown liability exposure related to acquired properties;•competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices; •our joint venture partners;•Seniors Housing Operating properties operational risks;•our ability to terminate our management agreements with Seniors Housing Operating managers;•operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures; •the ability of operators to make payments to us;•the impacts of severe cold and flu seasons or other widespread illnesses on occupancy;•the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors; 24•our ability to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us; •any adverse developments in the business or financial condition of Sunrise Senior Living, LLC; •any failure, inability or unwillingness by ProMedica Health System and Genesis Healthcare to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us; •ownership of property outside the U.S.; •the impact of Brexit on our operations located in the U.K.;•our ability to lease or sell properties on favorable terms;•tenant, operator and manager insurance coverage;•loss of properties owned through ground leases upon breach or termination of the ground leases;•requirements of, or changes to governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding;•controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay;•our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards;•development, redevelopment and construction; •losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change;•costs incurred to remediate environmental contamination at our properties;•cybersecurity incidents; and •our dependence on key personnel.Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure Our capital structure involves exposure to risks, including those related to:•our future leverage;•the availability of cash for distributions to stockholders;•covenants in our debt agreements; •limitations on our ability to access capital; •changes affecting the availability of LIBOR;•any downgrades in our credit ratings; and•increases in interest rates. Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT As a result of our status as a REIT, we are exposed to risks, including those related to:•our ability to remain qualified as a REIT;•the ability of our subsidiaries to qualify as a REIT;•the impact of the 90% annual distribution requirement on our liquidity and ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions;•our limited use of TRSs under the Code;•special requirements applicable to the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary;•tax consequences if certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the IRS as “true leases; and•changes in our tax rate or exposure to additional tax liabilities.Risks Factors25This section highlights significant factors, events and uncertainties that could create risk with an investment in our securities. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face: our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. We group these risk factors into three categories:•Risks arising from our business;•Risks arising from our capital structure; and•Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our BusinessThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous factors that are not within our control. These factors include the duration and severity of the outbreak; availability and timely delivery and effectiveness of vaccines; public health measures, such as business closures and stay-at-home orders, and other actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic disruption and uncertainty in key markets and financial market volatility; and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general macroeconomic conditions and the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides.The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks, including but not limited to those discussed below:•Risks Related to Revenue: Our revenues and our operators' revenues are dependent on occupancy. Our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio has experienced a decline in spot occupancy from 85.8% at February 29, 2020 to 76.2% at December 31, 2020 and 74.4% at February 5, 2021. In addition to the impact of increases in mortality rates on occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating facilities, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has, to varying degrees during the course of the pandemic, prevented prospective occupants and their families from visiting our facilities and limited the ability of new occupants to move into our facilities due to heightened move-in criteria and screening. Although the ongoing impact of the pandemic and vaccine deployment on occupancy remain uncertain, occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties could further decrease. Such a decrease could affect the net operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make contractual payments to us. In addition, although we collected over 98% of rent due in the fourth quarter of 2020, rental income in our Outpatient Medical segment may decrease if our tenants do not renew leases or do not make timely or full lease payments as a result of temporary medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures or decisions by patients to delay treatments. As a result of the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operators and tenants, we may offer certain tenants concessions such as rent deferrals or rent abatements across our Triple-net and Outpatient Medical segments.•Risks Related to Operator and Tenant Financial Condition: In addition to decreased revenue from tenant and operator payments, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a heightened risk of tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency due to factors such as decreased occupancy, medical practice disruptions resulting from stay-at-home orders, increased health and safety and labor expenses or litigation resulting from developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. See"" - The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition"" for more information regarding operator and tenant bankruptcy risks. Our ability to terminate our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant may be severely limited under current conditions due to the industry and macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and local ordinances. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings, particularly in light of ongoing publicity related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. •Risks Related to Operations: Across all of our properties, we and our operators have incurred increased operational costs as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties and our operations, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to our efforts to procure PPE and supplies on behalf of our operators. Such operational costs may increase in the future based on the duration and severity of the pandemic or the introduction of additional public health regulations. Operators and tenants are also subject to risks arising from the unique pressures on seniors housing and medical practice employees during 26the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of difficult conditions and stresses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, employee morale and productivity may suffer and additional pay, such as hazard pay, may not be sufficient to retain key operator and tenant employees. In addition, our operations or those of our operators or tenants may be adversely impacted if a significant number of our employees or those of our operators or tenants contract COVID-19. Although we continue to undertake extensive efforts to ensure the safety of our properties, employees and residents and to provide operator support in this regard, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our facilities could result in additional operational costs and reputational and litigation risk to us and our operators. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operator and tenant cost of insurance is expected to increase and such insurance may not cover certain claims related to COVID-19. Our exposure to COVID-19 related litigation risk may be increased if the operators or tenants of the relevant facilities are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, to varying degrees during the course of the pandemic we have experienced increased operational challenges and costs resulting from logistical challenges such as supply chain interruptions, business closures and restrictions on the movement of people. In response to stay-at-home orders and to support the health and well-being of our employees, the large majority of our employees are currently working remotely. The effects of such work arrangements for an extended period of time could impact employee productivity and morale and introduce additional operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks.•Risks Related to Property Acquisitions and Dispositions: As a result of uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on our business and related industries, our investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties, as well as our ability to transition or sell properties with profitable results, may be limited. Such disruptions to acquisition, disposition and development activity may negatively impact our long-term competitive position.•Risks Related to Liquidity: If our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets relating to the pandemic, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, a prolonged period of decreased revenue and limited acquisition and disposition activity may adversely affect our financial condition and long-term growth prospects and there can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades. Future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of capital, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.•Risks Related to Dividends: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could adversely affect our ability to pay dividend distributions at expected levels or at all. All distributions are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with Delaware law and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available to us, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual agreements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions under Delaware law and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our Board of Directors will continue to assess our dividend rate on an ongoing basis, as the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions and our financial position continue to evolve. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 of $0.61 per share, consistent with the cash dividends for the quarters ended September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2020, representing a 30% decrease from the $0.87 per share dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.There remains uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and any future stimulus or other COVID-19 relief legislation. There can be no assurance as to the amount of financial assistance we and our operators will receive or that we will be able to comply with the terms and conditions to keep such assistance.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (""PPPHCE Act""), signed into law on March 20, 2020, and April 24, 2020, respectively, authorized $175 billion in funding to be distributed to healthcare providers, including assisted living facilities. These funds, distributed through the Provider Relief Fund and administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, are required to be used to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and reimburse expenses or lost revenues attributable the COVID-19 pandemic. Although these distributions are not subject to repayment, attestation and compliance with certain terms and conditions including detailed reporting and auditing are required. Any funds that are ultimately received and retained by us are not expected to fully offset the losses incurred in our senior living portfolio that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.In 2020 applications were made for amounts under Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Provider Relief Fund following the announcement from the Department of Health and Human Services that it expanded the eligibility of the CARES Act to include assisted living facilities. During the fourth quarter, we received Provider Relief Funds of approximately $9 million which was recognized as a reduction to property operating expenses. To date in 2021, we have received approximately $34 million of 27Provider Relief Funds. While we have received some funds to date, there can be no assurance that all of our applications will be approved or that additional funds will ultimately be received in full or in part. Our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations Some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations. Investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all. We may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. We also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilityWe may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include: liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for propertiesWe may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other well-capitalized investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors. This competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors and, even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.Our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations, and disputes between us and our partners We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture; that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests; and that our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest and risks to our REIT status. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell, put right or forced sale arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, acquire our partner’s interest or sell the underlying asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. On the other hand, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited and/or valued lower than fair market value. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property.28We assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionWe have entered into various joint ventures that were structured under the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”), which permits REITs to own or partially own “qualified health care properties” in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations (as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments) in compliance with REIT requirements. A “qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients.Under a RIDEA structure, we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property, including complying with laws and providing resident care. However, as the owner of the property under a RIDEA structure, we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property, including, but not limited to, those relating to employment matters of our operators, compliance with health care fraud and abuse and other laws, governmental reimbursement matters, compliance with federal, state, local and industry-related licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards, and litigation involving our properties or residents/patients, even though we have limited ability to control or influence our operators’ management of these risks. Further, our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) is generally required to hold the applicable health care license and enroll in the applicable government health care programs (e.g., Medicare- and Medicaid), which subjects us to potential liability under various health care regulatory laws. Penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws may include loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need, certification or accreditation, exclusion from government health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties. Although we have some general oversight approval rights and the right to review operational and financial reporting information, our operators are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the property, including clinical decision-making, and we rely on them to operate the properties in a manner that complies with applicable law.We are exposed to operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operationsWe are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. In addition to operational challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, these risks include fluctuations in occupancy experienced during the normal course of business, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; increases in property taxes; state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; federal and state housing laws and regulations, including rent and eviction restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations.We have rights to terminate our management agreements with operators, in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace if our management agreements are terminated or not renewedWe are parties to long-term management agreements with our Seniors Housing Operating managers pursuant to which they provide comprehensive property management, accounting and other services with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. We have the ability to  terminate any of our management agreements upon the occurrence of certain events such as insolvency relating to such manager, and in some cases, the failure to meet specific NOI targets without curing, as well as the occurrence of other events or certain conditions.   We regularly monitor and review our rights and remedies under our management agreements. When determining if we will take significant action under those agreements, including terminating a manager, we consider numerous legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant factors. In exercising our rights to terminate or not renew a management agreement, we would work with our existing seniors housing operators or potentially new operators to manage the properties; however, there is no assurance that we would be able to timely source a replacement or that any replacement manager would be effective. Any transition to a new manager would most likely require regulatory approval and potentially the approval of the holders of any liens on the property. The failure to replace on a timely basis, as well as the failure to receive these approvals, either at all or in a timely manner, could have an adverse effect on the properties and our revenue.  Decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to usWe have very limited control over the success or failure of our operators' businesses and, at any time, an operator may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition. Our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are 29primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating costs continue to increase for our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results. These risks are magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease, as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. Although our lease agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.Increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ and managers' ability to meet their obligations to us The operators and managers of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators and managers of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients, including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price, and location. Our operators and managers are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses. In addition, we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities. We cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that meet our expected yields and fulfill their obligations to us, including but not limited to the results of the COVID-19 pandemic. If our operators and managers cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities, their financial performance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.A severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net propertiesIn addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business and operations are exposed to risks from severe cold and flu seasons or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses. Our revenues and our operators' revenues are dependent on occupancy and the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness. Such a decrease could affect the operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make payments to us. As experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, a future flu or other pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators, including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents, and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, which may result in a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. We may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us From time to time, we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities, principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties, including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns, we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors, including 30other health care REITs, real estate partnerships, health care providers, health care lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. This competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us. In addition, our ability to execute on our real estate investment strategies may be temporarily disrupted during periods of financial market volatility or real estate and health care industry market uncertainty, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.The properties managed by Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (“Sunrise”) account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us As of December 31, 2020, Sunrise managed 165 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income. Although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on Sunrise’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our Seniors Housing Operating properties efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, we depend on Sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. A shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force Sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. Any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by Sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in Sunrise’s senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our Seniors Housing Operating properties and have a material adverse effect on us. Also, if Sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could result in, among other things, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we determine to sell or transition properties currently managed by Sunrise, we may experience operational challenges and/or significantly declining financial performance for those properties. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. We depend on ProMedica Health System (""ProMedica"") and Genesis Healthcare (“Genesis”) for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us The properties we lease to ProMedica and Genesis account for a significant portion of our revenues, and because these leases are triple-net leases, we also depend on ProMedica and Genesis to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. We cannot assure you that ProMedica and Genesis will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by ProMedica and Genesis to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ProMedica and Genesis have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that ProMedica and Genesis will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. ProMedica and Genesis's failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we have made loans to Genesis and their operational or other failures could adversely impact their ability to repay these loans when due. During 2020, Genesis indicated substantial doubt as to their ability to continue as a going concern. Effective July 1, 2020, we revised our method of revenue recognition to a cash-basis accounting method from a straight-line accounting method and wrote off existing straight-line rent receivable balances of $91,025,000. In addition, during 2020 we recognized $80,873,000 of provision for loan losses with respect to our Genesis loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, Genesis is current on all obligations to us.Ownership of property outside the U.S. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations We have operations in the U.K. and Canada which represent 9.8% and 9.4% of total Welltower revenues, respectively.  As of December 31, 2020, Revera managed 94 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties in Canada, representing a significant portion of our revenues, and also owned a controlling interest in Sunrise. International development, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, any international currency gain or loss recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates, which may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test required for us to satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; impact 31from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants' supply chain and consumer spending levels; changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions (regionally, nationally and locally) including, but not limited to, the macroeconomic and regulatory effects of Brexit, including impacts on the U.K. real estate market; challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in foreign countries; local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political and economic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The business and financial results of our operations located in the U.K. may be negatively impacted as a result of BrexitThe future relationship between the U.K. and the EU, as well as the legal and economic consequences of those terms remain unclear, including with respect to the post-Brexit regulatory environment in the U.K. It is possible that the level of health care and other economic activity in the U.K. will be adversely impacted by the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU in 2020 (commonly referred to as ""Brexit"") and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities which could have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of our properties in the U.K.Moreover, the value of the British Pound Sterling incurred significant fluctuations. If the value of the British Pound Sterling continues to incur similar fluctuations, unfavorable exchange rate changes may negatively affect the value of our operations located in the U.K., as translated to our reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which may impact the revenue and earnings we report. Continued fluctuations in the British Pound Sterling may also result in the imposition of price adjustments by E.U.-based suppliers to our U.K. operations, as those suppliers seek to compensate for the changes in value of the British Pound Sterling as compared to the European Euro. If our tenants do not renew their existing leases, or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons, we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms, or at allWe cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties, or sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire. In addition, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms.Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator, economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Our tenants, operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses We maintain or require our tenants, operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. Our tenants, operators and manager may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages. Also, we may not be able to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements, which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss. We cannot make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. Insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or policies may not be maintained at a level that will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. This may be especially the case due to increases in property insurance costs. In addition, in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets. Due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ future 32operations, cash flows and financial conditions, and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us.Our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. Many of these ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us Some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), any lapse in Congressional funding of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. In recent years, government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures. Federal and state authorities may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Reimbursement” above for additional information. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us. Since January 1, 2014, the Health Reform Laws have provided those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of early January 2021, more than 75% of the states have expanded Medicaid coverage. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants. The status of the Health Reform Laws may be subject to change as a result of political, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a case seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act on November 10, 2020, with a decision expected to be issued in 2021. Additionally, while the Trump Administration and prior U.S. Congresses have sought to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Health Reform Laws, including Medicaid expansion, there is uncertainty with respect to the impact the Biden Administration and the new U.S. Congress may have upon the Health Reform Laws. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. More generally, and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business, or that of our operators and tenants. If controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our health care facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affectedControls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization reviews,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our health care facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required pre-admission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to 33impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide health care services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. If so, this could adversely affect these tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and/or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us.Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us Our operators and tenants generally are subject to or impacted by varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards. These laws and regulations include, among others: laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices; laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business, such as fire, health and safety, data security and privacy laws; federal and state laws affecting hospitals, clinics and other health care communities that participate in both Medicare and Medicaid that specify reimbursement rates, pricing, reimbursement procedures and limitations, quality of services and care, background checks, food service and physical plants, and similar foreign laws regulating the health care industry; resident rights laws (including abuse and neglect laws) and fraud laws; anti-kickback and physician referral laws; the ADA and similar state and local laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or similar foreign agencies. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs, civil liability, and in certain limited instances, criminal penalties, loss of license, closure of the facility and/or the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action. The likelihood of these actions may increase due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. In addition, we may be directly subject to certain health care fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws, as well as potential investigation or enforcement, as a result of our RIDEA-structured arrangements, and certain other arrangements we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to these laws. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Fraud & Abuse Enforcement” and “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Health Care Matters - Generally” above.Many of our properties may require a license, registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. In addition, we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the health care industry, including our tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants and operators will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor cost levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us.Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionFrom time to time, we are directly involved or named as a party in in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims that involve class actions, disputes regarding property damage, care matters and other issues. We also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses, significantly divert the attention of management, and could damage our reputation and our brand. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business. We cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage.Development, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitabilityIn connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may abandon opportunities we have begun to investigate, for a range of reasons, including changes in expected financing or 34construction costs, adverse changes in expected rents or expenses, adverse environmental findings, or conditions to zoning approval, which would result in additional expenses beyond those originally expected. In addition, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities. We may not be able to complete construction and lease-up of a property on budget and on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial performance. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy, rental rates, operating expenses, capital costs and future competition. If our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate, the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property. Operators of new facilities we construct may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third-party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts. We may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change, which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, unanticipated costs associated with evacuation, a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property We maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods, as well as the effects of climate change. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including but not limited to the costs associated with evacuation. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property. In addition, we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss. Also, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material, including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income.We may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial conditionUnder various laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. We may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an 35interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential informationOur business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity, attempts to interrupt our access to or use of information technology systems through distributed denial-of-service or ransomware attacks, breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources, and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents within our environment or our third party vendors' environments, including those resulting from human error, product defects and technology failures. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our vendors' information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats, and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks. Our information technology networks, suppliers and related systems are essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing or detecting a cyber-attack. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures, or recover from an attack without operational impact, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. In the past, we have experienced cybersecurity breaches, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. We must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary, personal identifying or confidential information of our employees, operators, tenants and partners or result in operational disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings, including enforcement actions by regulators under data privacy regulations, such as the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation which imposes administrative fines for serious breaches up to the greater of 4% of annual worldwide turnover or £17.5 million.Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed Our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our executive officers and other highly qualified employees, and competition for their talents is intense. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Losing any key personnel could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure We may become more leveraged Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies or (5) make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt. Cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors If cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise, we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. Our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. All distributions are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with Delaware law and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available to us, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions under Delaware law and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Additionally, our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein, or other significant adverse events, occur. 36We are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitmentsWe cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions; the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of our common stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and the transition to any other interest rate benchmark; and default or delay in payment by the U.S. of its obligations. We also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. If our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders.Changes affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may have consequences for us that cannot yet reasonably be predictedWe have outstanding debt, hedge agreements and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In November 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, with support of the United States Federal Reserve and the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extends the transition period, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to which reference rate or rates or benchmarks may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Fed, has identified the Second Oversight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative rate for LIBOR. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist after 2021. While it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether, or to what extent, the withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR would affect us, the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact contracts that terminate after 2023. There is uncertainty about how applicable law, the courts or we will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on agreements that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capitalWe plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, the trading/redemption price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders.Increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cost of capitalAn increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt.  Such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations, acquire and develop properties, and refinance existing debt. Additionally, increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets, limiting our ability to sell existing assets.Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT 37We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believe we have operated and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because:•we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;•we would be subject to increased state and local taxes; and•unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which we were disqualified. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains with respect to distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REITWe own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes (each a “Subsidiary REIT”). To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under the Code, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. Provided that each Subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in the Subsidiary REITs will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. If a Subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions. The 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. Our use of TRSs is limited under the CodeUnder the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’ operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. Also, our TRSs may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our TRSs that are not on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with our TRSs are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.38The lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirementsWe lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arm's-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. If certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as “true leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences We have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the IRS, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. We could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. Longstanding international norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us, thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If we were subject to review or examination by the IRS or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes, the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected.The present federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The federal income tax rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation and REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions might affect our investors or us. Revisions in tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us, could cause us to change our investments and commitments, and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow"
3,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2020-02-14,"Risk Factors
This section highlights significant factors, events and uncertainties that could create risk with an investment in our securities. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face: our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. We group these risk factors into three categories:•Risks arising from our business;•Risks arising from our capital structure; and•Risks arising from our status as a REIT. 23Risks Arising from Our BusinessOur investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations We are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations. Investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all. We may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. We also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilityWe may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include: liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for propertiesWe may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other well-capitalized investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors. This competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors and, even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.Our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations, and disputes between us and our partners We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture; that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests; and that our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest and risks to our REIT status. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell, put right or forced sale arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, acquire our partner’s interest or sell the underlying asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. On the other hand, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited and/or valued lower than fair market value. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property.24We are exposed to operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operationsWe are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations.We assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionWe have entered into various joint ventures that were structured under the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”), which permits REITs to own or partially own “qualified health care properties” in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations (as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments) in compliance with REIT requirements. A “qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients.Under a RIDEA structure, we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property, including complying with laws and providing resident care. However, as the owner of the property under a RIDEA structure, we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property, including, but not limited to, those relating to employment matters of our operators, compliance with health care fraud and abuse and other laws, governmental reimbursement matters, compliance with federal, state, local and industry-related licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards, and litigation involving our properties or residents/patients, even though we have limited ability to control or influence our operators’ management of these risks. Further, our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) is generally required to hold the applicable health care license and enroll in the applicable government health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), which subjects us to potential liability under various health care regulatory laws. Penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws may include loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need, certification or accreditation, exclusion from government health care programs (e.g., Medicare  and Medicaid), administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties. Although we have some general oversight approval rights and the right to review operational and financial reporting information, our operators are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the property, including clinical decision-making, we rely on them to operate the properties in compliance with a manner that complies with applicable law.Decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to usWe have very limited control over the success or failure of our operators' businesses and, at any time, an operator may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition. Our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating costs continue to increase for our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results. These risks are magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease, as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. Although our lease agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.Increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us The operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients, including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price, and location. Our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses. In addition, we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities. We cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to 25meet all of their obligations to us. If our operators cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities, their financial performance and ability to meet their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. A severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net propertiesOur revenues and our operators’ revenues are dependent on occupancy. It is impossible to predict the severity of the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses. The occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness. Such a decrease could affect the operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make payments to us. In addition, a flu pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators, including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents, and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, which may result in a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. We may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us From time to time, we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities, principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties, including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns, we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors, including other health care REITs, real estate partnerships, health care providers, health care lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. This competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us. The properties managed by Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (“Sunrise”) account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us As of December 31, 2019, Sunrise managed 165 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income. Although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on Sunrise’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our Seniors Housing Operating properties efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, we depend on Sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. A shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force Sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. Any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by Sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in Sunrise’s senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our Seniors Housing Operating properties and have a material adverse effect on us. Also, if Sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties 26could result in, among other things, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we determine to sell or transition additional properties currently managed by Sunrise, we may experience operational challenges and/or significantly declining financial performance for those properties. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. We depend on ProMedica Health System (""ProMedica"") and Genesis HealthCare (“Genesis”) for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us The properties we lease to ProMedica and Genesis account for a significant portion of our revenues, and because these leases are triple-net leases, we also depend on ProMedica and Genesis to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. We cannot assure you that ProMedica and Genesis will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by ProMedica and Genesis to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ProMedica and Genesis have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that ProMedica and Genesis will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. ProMedica and Genesis's failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we have made real estate and other loans to Genesis and their operational or other failures could adversely impact their ability to repay these loans when due.Ownership of property outside the U.S. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations We have operations in the U.K. and Canada which represent 8.8% and 9.1% of total Welltower revenues, respectively.  As of December 31, 2019, Revera managed 94 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties in Canada, representing a significant portion of our revenues, and also owned a controlling interest in Sunrise. International development, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates, which may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test required for us to satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants' supply chain and consumer spending levels; changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions (regionally, nationally and locally) including, but not limited to, continuing uncertainty surrounding the process of Brexit and the macroeconomic and regulatory effects of Brexit, including impacts on the U.K. real estate market; challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in foreign countries; local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political and economic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The business and financial results of our operations located in the U.K.  may be negatively impacted as a result of BrexitThe U.K.’s referendum on withdrawal from the EU in 2016 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and subsequent notification of the U.K.’s intention to withdraw from the EU given in March 2017, have adversely impacted global markets and foreign currencies. The terms governing the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU, as well as the legal and economic consequences of those terms, remain unclear, including with respect to the post-Brexit regulatory environment in the U.K. It is possible that the level of health care and other economic activity in the U.K. and the rest of Europe will be adversely impacted and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities in these regions which could have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of our properties in the U.K.Moreover, the value of the British Pound Sterling incurred significant fluctuations. If the value of the British Pound Sterling continues to incur similar fluctuations, unfavorable exchange rate changes may negatively affect the value of our operations located in the U.K., as translated to our reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which may impact the revenue and earnings we report. Continued fluctuations in the British Pound Sterling may also result in the imposition of price adjustments by E.U.-based suppliers to our U.K. operations, as those suppliers seek to compensate for the changes in value of the British Pound Sterling as compared to the European Euro. 27If our tenants do not renew their existing leases, or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons, we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms, or at allWe cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties, or sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire. In addition, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms.Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator, economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Our tenants, operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses We maintain or require our tenants, operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. Our tenants, operators and manager may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages. Also, we may not be able to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements, which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss. We cannot make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. Insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or policies may not be maintained at a level that will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. This may be especially the case due to increases in property insurance costs. In addition, in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets. General and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ future operations, cash flows and financial conditions, and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us.Our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. Many of these ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us Some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), any lapse in Congressional funding of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. In recent years, government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures. Federal and state authorities may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Reimbursement” 28above for additional information. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us. Since January 1, 2014, the Health Reform Laws have provided those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of early January 2020, more than 70% of the states have expanded Medicaid coverage. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants. The status of the Health Reform Laws may be subject to change as a result of political, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. The current Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress have sought to and may continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Health Reform Laws, including Medicaid expansion. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the Health Reform Laws.  See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Reimbursement” above for additional information. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. More generally, and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business, or that of our operators and tenants. If controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our health care facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affectedControls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization reviews,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our health care facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide health care services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. If so, this could adversely affect these tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and/or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us.Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us Our operators and tenants generally are subject to or impacted by varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards. These laws and regulations include, among others: laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices; laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business, such as fire, health and safety, data security and privacy laws; federal and state laws affecting hospitals, clinics and other health care communities that participate in both Medicare and Medicaid that specify reimbursement rates, pricing, reimbursement procedures and limitations, quality of services and care, background checks, food service and physical plants, and similar foreign laws regulating the health care industry; resident rights laws (including abuse and neglect laws) and fraud laws; anti-kickback and physician referral laws; the ADA and similar state and local laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or similar foreign agencies. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs, civil liability, and in certain limited instances, criminal penalties, loss of license, closure of the facility and/or the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. In addition, we may be directly subject to certain health care fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws, as well as potential investigation or enforcement, as a result of our RIDEA-structured arrangements, and certain other arrangements we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to these laws. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations 29- United States - Fraud & Abuse Enforcement” and “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Health Care Matters - Generally” above. Many of our properties may require a license, registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. In addition, we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the health care industry, including our tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants and operators will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor cost levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us.Changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. Longstanding international norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us, thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionFrom time to time, we are directly involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses, significantly divert the attention of management, and could damage our reputation and our brand. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business. We cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage.Development, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitabilityIn connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may not be able to complete construction and lease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. We may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms, or at all, for the proposed development, which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity. Newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial performance. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy, rental rates and capital costs. If our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors, the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property. 30New facilities that we construct often require a CON and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third-party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts. We may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change, which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, unanticipated costs associated with evacuation, a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property We maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods, as well as the effects of climate change. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including but not limited to the costs associated with evacuation. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property.  In addition, we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss. Also, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income.We may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial conditionUnder various laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. We may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential informationOur business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity, attempts to interrupt our access to or use of IT systems through distributed denial-of-service or ransomware attacks, breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources, and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents, including those resulting from human error, product defects and technology failures. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats, and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks. Our information technology networks and related systems are essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such 31efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. In the past, we have experienced cybersecurity breaches, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. We must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary, personal identifying or confidential information of our employees, operators, tenants and partners could result in legal claims or proceedings, including under data privacy regulations.Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed Our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our executive officers and other highly qualified employees, and competition for their talents is intense. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Losing any key personnel could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. We may become more leveraged Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies or (5) make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt. Cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors If cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise, we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. Our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. All distributions are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with Delaware law and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available to us, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions under Delaware law and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Additionally, our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein, or other significant adverse events, occur. We are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitmentsWe cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions; the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of our common stock and the credit 32ratings of our debt securities; changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and the transition to any other interest rate benchmark; and default or delay in payment by the U.S. of its obligations. We also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. If our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders.Changes affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may have consequences for us that cannot yet reasonably be predictedWe have outstanding debt, hedge agreements and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist after 2021. While it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether, or to what extent, the withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR would affect us, the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact contracts that terminate after 2021. There is uncertainty about how applicable law, the courts or we will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on agreements that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capitalWe plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, the trading/redemption price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders.Increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cost of capitalAn increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt.  Such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations, acquire and develop properties, and refinance existing debt. Additionally, increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets, limiting our ability to sell existing assets.Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial positionCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position, including exchange rate fluctuations resulting from Brexit. We generate a portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us.Our entry into hedge agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates We enter into hedge agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a risk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 33Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believe we have operated and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because:•we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;•we would be subject to increased state and local taxes; and•unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which we were disqualified. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains with respect to distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REITWe own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes (each a “Subsidiary REIT”). To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under the Code, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. Provided that each Subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in the Subsidiary REITs will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. If a Subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions. The 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. Our use of TRSs is limited under the CodeUnder the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’ operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. Also, our TRSs may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments 34we might otherwise make. Finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our TRSs that are not on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with our TRSs are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.The lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirementsWe lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arm's-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. If certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as “true leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences We have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the IRS, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. We could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If we were subject to review or examination by the IRS or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes, the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected.The present federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The federal income tax rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation and REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us, or could cause us to change our investments and commitments"
15,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2019-02-25,"Risk Factors
This section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. It does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed in this section or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. We group these risk factors into three categories:•Risks arising from our business;•Risks arising from our capital structure; and•Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our BusinessOur investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations We are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations. Investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummated in accordance with 25anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all. Health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. We also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. All of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate. Our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations, and disputes between us and our partners We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests. In addition, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property. We are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operationsWe are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations.Decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to usOur operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating costs continue to increase for our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results.  All of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate. Increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us The operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients, including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price, and location. Our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses.  In addition, we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities. We cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us.  If our operators cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities, their financial performance and ability to meet their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. A severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triple-net properties26Our revenues and our operators’ revenues are dependent on occupancy. It is impossible to predict the severity of the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses. The occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness.  Such a decrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triple-net operators to make payments to us. In addition, a flu pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators, including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents, and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, which may result in a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected. All of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate. We may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us From time to time, we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities, principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties, including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest these proceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors, including other health care REITs, real estate partnerships, health care providers, health care lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. This competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us. The properties managed by Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (“Sunrise”) account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us As of December 31, 2018, Sunrise managed 161 of our seniors housing operating properties.  These properties account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we rely on Sunrise to manage these properties efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations.  Any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Also, if Sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could result in, among other things, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. We depend on Genesis HealthCare (“Genesis”), Brookdale Senior Living (“Brookdale”) and ProMedica Health System (""ProMedica"") for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us The properties we lease to Genesis, Brookdale and ProMedica account for a significant portion of our revenues, and because these leases are triple-net leases, we also depend on Genesis, Brookdale and ProMedica to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. We cannot assure you that Genesis, Brookdale and ProMedica will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by Genesis, Brookdale or ProMedica 27to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Genesis, Brookdale and ProMedica have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that Genesis, Brookdale and ProMedica will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations.  Genesis, Brookdale and ProMedica's failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we have made real estate and other loans to Genesis and their operational or other failures could adversely impact their ability to repay these loans when due.Ownership of property outside the U.S. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations We have operations in Canada and the U.K. which represent 10.0% and 9.6% of total Welltower revenues, respectively.  As of December 31, 2018, Revera managed 98 of our seniors housing operating properties in Canada, representing a significant portion of our revenues, and also owned a controlling interest in Sunrise. International development, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions (regionally, nationally and locally) including, but not limited to, continuing uncertainty surrounding the process of Brexit and the macroeconomic and regulatory effects of Brexit, including impacts on the U.K. real estate market; challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political and economic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If our tenants do not renew their existing leases, or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons, we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms, or at allWe cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator, economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.  All of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate. Our tenants, operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses We maintain or require our tenants, operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly-situated companies in our industry, and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. That said, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, operators or managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages or that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements, which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss. Also, in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets. General and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ future operations, cash flows and financial condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us. Our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 28We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us. The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us Some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), any lapse in Congressional funding of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. In recent years, government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us. The Health Reform Laws, provide those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of early February 2018, more than 60% of the states have expanded Medicaid coverage. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants. We expect that the current Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Health Reform Laws, including Medicaid expansion. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the Health Reform Laws.  See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Reimbursement” above for additional information. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. More generally, and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business, or that of our operators and tenants. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us Our operators and tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Fraud & Abuse Enforcement” above. Many of our properties may require a license, registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. The real estate market and our business may be negatively impacted by changes to U.S. tax laws The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act"") enacted in December 2017 significantly changes the U.S. income tax rules for individuals and corporations. Although the Tax Act involves comprehensive changes to the system of corporate income tax, it does not substantively change the manner in which REITs are taxed. Although numerous provisions of the Tax Act do affect REITs, we are 29generally not subject to federal taxes applicable to regular corporations if we comply with the tax law governing REIT status and distribute annually an amount at least equal to our taxable income. Nonetheless, the Tax Act makes numerous changes to the individual income tax rules that may affect the real estate market in the U.S., including limitations on the deductibility of state and local property taxes and interest. Although the impact of these changes is likely to be most significant in the residential real estate market, rather than in the sectors where we operate, the effects of these changes on the broader real estate market in the geographic areas in which we operate and on our tenants remain uncertain. Changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Because, even with the passage of the Tax Act, the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. Longstanding international norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us, thereby, increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionFrom time to time, we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations.Development, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitabilityAt any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts. In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may not be able to complete construction and lease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial performance. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy, rental rates and capital costs. If our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors, the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property. We may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters, which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property 30We maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property.  In addition, we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss. We may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial conditionUnder various laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential informationOur business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic security breaches, including those resulting from human error, product defects and technology failures. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. In the past, we have experienced cybersecurity breaches, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary, personal identifying or confidential information of our employees, operators, tenants and partners could result in legal claims or proceedings, including under data privacy regulations.Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed Our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our executive officers and other highly qualified employees, and competition for their talents is intense. We cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Losing any key personnel could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. We may become more leveraged Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make 31us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies. Cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors If cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise, we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. Our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. All distributions are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with Delaware law and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available to us, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions under Delaware law and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Additionally, our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein, or other significant adverse events, occur. We are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitmentsWe cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions; the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; the financial stability of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us; changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; or default or delay in payment by the U.S. of its obligations. If our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders.Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capitalWe plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.Increases in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our cost of capitalAn increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt.  Such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations, the acquisition and development of properties, and refinance existing debt. Additionally, increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets, limiting our ability to sell existing assets.Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial positionCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position, including exchange rate fluctuations resulting from Brexit. We generate a portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us.Our entry into hedge agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates We enter into hedge agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign 32currency exchange rates. When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a risk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Risks Arising from Our Status as a REIT We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because:•we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;•we could be subject to possibly increased state and local taxes; and•unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which we were disqualified. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 20%) with respect to distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REITWe own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes (each a “Subsidiary REIT”). To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under the Code, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. Provided that each Subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in the Subsidiary REITs will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. If a Subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions. The 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. The lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements33We lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. If certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as “true leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences We have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the IRS, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. We could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  Our analysis of the Tax Act may be impacted by any corrective legislation and any guidance provided by the U.S. Treasury and the IRS.  Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.  We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies.  We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes.  There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.  If we were subject to review or examination by the IRS or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes (including the recently enacted Tax Act) the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected"
14,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2018-02-28,"Risk Factors
      This section discusses themost significant factors that affect our business, operations and financialcondition. It does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us,our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, aswell as other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed in this section orthat we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materiallyadversely affected and the value of our securities could decline. We groupthese risk factors into three categories:•         Risks arising from our business;•         Risks arising from our capital structure; and •         Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our Business Our investments in and acquisitionsof health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail tomeet our expectations      We are exposed to the riskthat some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We couldencounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquiredproperties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties mightrequire significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to ourongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to anoperator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps toensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect ourresults of operations. Investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing andhealth care properties entail risks associated with real estate investmentsgenerally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expectedreturns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will proveinaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meetperformance expectations.  Furthermore, there can be no assurance that ouranticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject tovarious conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing,on anticipated terms, or at all.  Health care properties are often highlycustomizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties mayrequire costly tenant-specific improvements.  We also may be unable to quicklyand efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions ofportfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have anadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  As aresult, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit weexpect from acquisitions, investment, development and redevelopmentopportunities.  All of the foregoing could affect our ability to continuepaying dividends at the current rate. Our investments in jointventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control overthese investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet theirobligations, and disputes between us and our partners      We have entered into, and maycontinue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with otherpersons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not bepresent with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that ourpartner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when dueor otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certainliabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner mightat any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are orbecome inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engagedin a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additionalresources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on theoperations and profitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may bein a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructionsor requests. In addition, our ability to transfer our interest in a jointventure to a third party may be restricted. In some instances, we and/or ourpartner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could causeus to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when weotherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquireour partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash,available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we maybe forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwiseprefer to retain it. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-makingauthority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control theproperties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest,certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale,acquisition or financing of a property. We are exposed to operationalrisks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that couldadversely affect our revenue and operations       We are exposed to variousoperational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties thatmay increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and Medicaidreimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions;competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availabilityand increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage;state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and theavailability and 13 increases in the cost of labor (as aresult of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factorsmay adversely affect our revenue and operations. Decreases in our operators’revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ability to make payments to us      Our operators’ revenues areprimarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaidreimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarilydriven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent ordebt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to,come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.Operating costs continue to increase for our operators. To the extent that anydecrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in aproperty not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of ouroperator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To theextent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record animpairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of anunderperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairmentor loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results.  All of theforegoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the currentrate. Increased competition andoversupply may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations tous        The operators of ourproperties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of propertiesand other health care providers that provide comparable services for residentsand patients, including on the basis of the scope and quality of care andservices provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance ofthe properties, price, and location.  Our operators are expected to encounterincreased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attractresidents or expand their businesses.  In addition, we expect that there willcontinue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities.  Wecannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able toachieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet allof their obligations to us.  If our operators cannot compete effectively or ifthere is an oversupply of facilities, their financial performance and abilityto meet their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial results. A severe cold and flu season,epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect theoccupancy of our seniors housing operating and triple-net properties      Our and our operators’ revenuesare dependent on occupancy.  It is impossible to predict the severity of thecold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespreadillnesses.  The occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triple-netproperties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and fluseason, an epidemic or any other widespread illness.  Such a decrease couldaffect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and theability of our triple-net operators to make payments to us.  In addition, a flupandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators,including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents, andadversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us, which wouldhave a material adverse effect on our financial results. The insolvency or bankruptcyof our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adverselyaffect our business, results of operations and financial condition      We are exposed to the riskthat our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may not beable to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, whichmay result in a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcyor insolvency, or that a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligormight become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons.Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict atenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and ourloans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demandimmediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on thecollateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency lawsafford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy orreorganization. A tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor inbankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay ourability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaidprincipal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights andremedies. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claimagainst the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcylaw.  We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes andmaintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid theimposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant.In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet theproperty to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have providedworking capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If wecannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession ofthat property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Shouldsuch events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adverselyaffected.  All of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue payingdividends at the current rate. We may not be able to timelyreinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us      From time to time, we willhave cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities, principalpayments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties, includingnon-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similarfinancial support 14 arrangements. In order to maintaincurrent revenues and continue generating attractive returns, we expect tore-invest these proceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estateinvestments with a broad variety of potential investors, including other healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, health care providers, health carelenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies,pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some ofwhom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do.This competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our abilityto make timely investments on terms acceptable to us. Wedepend on Genesis HealthCare (“Genesis”) and Brookdale Senior Living (“Brookdale”)for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure, inability orunwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with uscould adversely affect us      The properties we lease toGenesis and Brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues, andbecause our leases with Genesis and Brookdale are triple-net leases, we alsodepend on Genesis and Brookdale to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities andmaintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. Wecannot assure you that Genesis and Brookdale will have sufficient assets,income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us orto otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases, and anyfailure, inability or unwillingness by Genesis or Brookdale to do so could havean adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition. Although the most recent publicly available financial statements ofGenesis reflect going concern disclosures, the operator remains current on rentand the coverage remains above 1.0.  Genesis and Brookdale have also agreed toindemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims,litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respectivebusinesses, and we cannot assure you that Genesis and Brookdale will havesufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enablethem to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations.  Genesis’s andBrookdale’s failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain andimprove our properties could adversely affect their business reputations andtheir ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties,which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Additionally, we have made real estate and other loans toGenesis and their operational or other failures could adversely impact theirability to repay these loans when due.  See Note 21 to our consolidatedfinancial statements for additional information regarding Genesis. The properties managed bySunrise Senior Living, LLC (“Sunrise”) account for a significant portion of ourrevenues and operating income and any adverse developments in its business orfinancial condition could adversely affect us      As of December 31, 2017,Sunrise managed 158 of our seniors housing operating properties.  Theseproperties account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we rely onSunrise to manage these properties efficiently and effectively.  We also relyon Sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-levelfinancial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwiseoperate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and allapplicable laws and regulations.  Any adverse developments in Sunrise’s businessor financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficientlyand effectively, which could adversely affect our business, results ofoperations, and financial condition.  Also, if Sunrise experiences anysignificant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, suchdifficulties could result in, among other things, acceleration of itsindebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencementof insolvency proceedings by or against it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements foradditional information. Ownership of property outsidethe U.S. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associatedwith our domestic operations      We have operations in Canadaand the U.K. International development, ownership, and operating activitiesinvolve risks that are different from those we face with respect to ourdomestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limitedto, any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes inexchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% grossincome test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain ourstatus as a REIT; challenges with respect tothe repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political,regulatory, and economic conditions (regionally, nationally and locally)including, but not limited to, the U.K.’s June 2016 vote to exit the EU; challengesin managing international operations; challenges of complying with a widevariety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to realestate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil andcriminal legal proceedings; foreign ownershiprestrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences in lendingpractices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to providefinancing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political andeconomic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws andregulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations, including, but notlimited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are unable tosuccessfully manage the risks associated with international expansion andoperations, our results of operations and financial condition may be adverselyaffected. If our tenants do not renewtheir existing leases, or if we are required to sell properties for liquidityreasons, we may be unable to lease or sell the properties onfavorable terms, or at all 15      Wecannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end oftheir lease terms, which expire at various times. If these leases are notrenewed, we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those propertiesor sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to identifysuitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms asfavorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease thoseproperties at all.      Real estate investments arerelatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized forspecific uses. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties inresponse to changes in operator, economic and other conditions will be limited.No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any propertythat we are required to sell. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes inthe performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and resultsof operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent inconcentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniorshousing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry couldadversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell propertiesfor a price or on terms acceptable to us.  All of the foregoing could affectour ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate. Our tenants, operators and managers may not havethe necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses      We maintain or require ourtenants, operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage onour properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits anddeductibles that we believe are customary for similarly-situated companies inour industry, and we frequently review our insurance programs andrequirements.  That said, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants,operators or managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels ofinsurance and required coverages or that we will continue to require the samelevels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements,which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss. Also, in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operatorsand managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and sizeof patient care liability claims. As a result, general and professionalliability costs have increased in some markets. General and professional liabilityinsurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affectthe tenants’, operators’ and managers’ future operations, cash flows and financial condition, andmay have a material adverse effect on the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ability to meet their obligations to us.   Our ownership of propertiesthrough ground leases exposes us to the loss of such propertiesupon breach or termination of the ground leases      We have acquired an interestin certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the propertyon which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties inthe future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. As the lesseeunder a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the propertyupon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground leaseby us. The requirements of, orchanges to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid orgovernment funding, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adverselyaffect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us      Some of our obligors’businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that anoperator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmentpayors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject tostatutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery ofprogram overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings,policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries orcarriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respectto specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due to anyongoing government investigations and audits at such property. In recent years,government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers dueto budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be ofparamount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make anyassessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reformsmay have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There canbe no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available forservices provided by any property operator, whether the property receivesreimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits onthe scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could havea material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition andresults of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligorto meet its obligations to us.       The HealthReform Laws, provide those states that expand their Medicaid coverage tootherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federalpoverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage,effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. Given that thefederal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclearhow many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of earlyFebruary 2018, more than 60% ofthe states have expanded Medicaid coverage. The participation by states in theMedicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and theirability to pay our tenants. We expect that the current PresidentialAdministration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwiseinvalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Health Reform Laws, includingMedicaid expansion. Since taking office, President Trump has continued tosupport the repeal of all or portions of the Health Reform Laws.  See“Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States —Reimbursement” above for additional information. If the operations, cash flowsor financial condition of our operators and tenants are 16 materiallyadversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenueand operations may be adversely affected as well. More generally, and becauseof the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for healthcare products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit andbudgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reachinglegislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business,or that of our operators and tenants. Our operators’ or tenants’failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulatedlicensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards couldadversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adverselyaffect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us       Our operators and tenantsgenerally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, andindustry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations,and standards. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of theselaws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denialof reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusionfrom federal and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of thefacility. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ abilityto make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. See “Item 1 —Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Fraud & AbuseEnforcement” above.      Many of our properties mayrequire a license, registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain alicense, registration, or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, orCON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by theoperators or tenants. These events could materially adversely affect ouroperators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us.State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition ofnew beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the constructionor renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or other similarapproval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain GovernmentRegulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. The real estate market andour business may be negatively impacted by changes to U.S. tax laws      The Tax Act adopted onDecember 22, 2017 significantly changes the U.S. income tax rules forindividuals and corporations.  We are continuing to evaluate the impact of theTax Act and, as such, its implications for our business remain uncertain. Although the Tax Act involves comprehensive changes to the system of corporateincome tax, it does not substantively change the manner in which REITs aretaxed.  Although numerous provisions of the Tax Act do affect REITs, we aregenerally not subject to pay federal taxes applicable to regular corporationsif we comply with the tax regulations governing REIT status.  Nonetheless, theTax Act makes numerous changes to the individual income tax rules that mayaffect the real estate market in the U.S., including limitations on thedeductibility of state and local property taxes, the elimination of thedeductibility of interest on new home equity loans and a reduction in the limitfor an individual’s mortgage interest expense to interest on $750,000 ofmortgages.  Although the impact of these changes is likely to be mostsignificant in the residential real estate market, rather than in the sectorswhere we operate, the effects of these changes on the broader real estatemarket in the geographic areas in which we operate and on our tenants remainuncertain. Changesin applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results      We are subject to taxation inthe U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Because, even with the passage ofthe Tax Act, the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreignand U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent.  Longstanding internationalnorms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-borderinternational trade are evolving, such as the Base Erosion and Profit Shiftingproject (“BEPS”) currently being undertaken by the G8, G20 and Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development.  Tax changes pursuant to BEPS couldreduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposesthe interest they pay on loans from us, thereby, increasing the foreign taxliability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries couldincrease their withholding taxes on dividends and interest.  Given theunpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency,it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changeson our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact ourfinancial results. Unfavorable resolution ofpending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition      From time to time, we may bedirectly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of ouractions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which suchoperators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold usharmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising inconnection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution ofpending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverseeffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardlessof its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses andsignificantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurancethat we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of,pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or futurelitigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead toincreased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. Development, redevelopmentand construction risks could affect our profitability17       At any given time, we may bein the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately willrequire a CON and license before they can be utilized by the operator for theirintended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaidcertification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/orthird party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtainthe necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contractsafter the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be ableto earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtainsa license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessaryprovider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operatorthat is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended useand the necessary provider agreements or contracts.      In connection with ourrenovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, wemay be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning,land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits andauthorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or ourabandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be able to obtainfinancing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with ourdevelopment activities, and we may not be able to complete construction andlease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debtservice expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame requiredfor development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that wemay have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required tomake cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operationsor refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional moneyto fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may notproduce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overallfinancial performance.      In deciding whether to acquireor develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expectedfuture performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return onour investment based on expected occupancy, rental rates and capital costs. Ifour financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as aresult of increases in capital costs or other factors, the property may fail toperform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costsof repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to beinaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals.Additionally, we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased, and thecash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operatingexpenses and debt service associated with that property. We mayexperience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters,which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, adecrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital wehave invested in a property      We maintainor require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on ourproperties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe areappropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and we frequentlyreview our insurance programs and requirements. However, a large number of ourproperties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, costincrease or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasterssuch as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods. We believe, givencurrent industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, thatour and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonablyanticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes,floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including theeffects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk thatsuch insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severityof the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover asignificant portion of the losses. These losses may lead to an increase of ourand our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues froman affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we haveinvested in an affected property.  In addition, we or our tenants may notpurchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insuranceexceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative tothe risk of loss. We may incur costs toremediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have anadverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition      Under various laws, owners oroperators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or releaseof hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for propertydamage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmentalcontamination or exposure to hazardous substances. We may become liable toreimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with thecontamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on theperson’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarilyresponsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we reviewenvironmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber priorto taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “allappropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocentpurchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon suchassessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject tomaterial environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may bepresent in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination,which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financialcondition or the business or financial condition of our obligors. Cybersecurity incidents coulddisrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information       Our business is at risk fromand may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gainunauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic security breaches,including those resulting from human error, product defects and technologyfailures. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gainunauthorized access to our information technology systems to 18 more sophisticated security threats. While we employ anumber of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is noguarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack.Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business, compromise the confidentialinformation of our employees, operators, tenants and partners, damage ourreputation and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. Our success depends on keypersonnel whose continued service is not guaranteed      Our success depends on thecontinued availability and service of key personnel, including our executiveofficers and other highly qualified employees, and competition for theirtalents is intense.  We cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnelor that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employeesin the future.  Losing any key personnel could, at least temporarily, have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial position and results ofoperations. Risks Arising from Our CapitalStructure Our certificate ofincorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions      Our certificate ofincorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions onshare ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approvalrequirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult foror even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of ourincumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit ordiscourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. We may become more leveraged      Permanent financing for ourinvestments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings ofdebt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become moreleveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cashflow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturnin the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, or (4)negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the ratingagencies. Cash available for distributionsto stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expectedlevels and are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors      If cash available fordistribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions orotherwise, we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. Our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decreasein the market price of our common stock.  All distributions are made at thediscretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with Delaware law and dependon our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available tous, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operatingperformance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractualarrangements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions underDelaware law and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant fromtime to time.  Additionally, our ability to make distributions will beadversely affected if any of the risks described herein, or other significantadverse events, occur. We are subject to covenantsin our debt agreements that could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition      Our debt agreements containvarious covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things,these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimumnet worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenantscould result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicableindebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted againstsuch instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability toaccess capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make futureinvestments or to meet our obligations and commitments      We cannot assure you that wewill be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or tomeet our obligations and commitments as they mature.  Our access to capitaldepends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control,including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions;the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potentialfuture earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of our capitalstock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; the financial stability ofour lenders, which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to usor their willingness to make additional loans to us; changes in the creditratings on U.S. government debt securities; or default or delay in payment bythe U.S. of its obligations. If our access to capital is limited by thesefactors or other factors, it could negatively impact our ability to acquireproperties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operations or makedistributions to our stockholders. 19 Downgradesin our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost andavailability of capital      We plan to manage the Companyto maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but therecan be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current creditratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of therating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availabilityof capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our resultsof operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Increases in interest ratescould have a material adverse impact on our cost of capital      An increase in interest ratesmay increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt.  Suchincreases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to financeoperations, the acquisition and development of properties, and refinanceexisting debt.  Additionally, increased interest rates may also result in lessliquid property markets, limiting our ability to sell existing assets. Fluctuations in the value offoreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial position      Currency exchange ratefluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position. Wegenerate a portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies asthe Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. Although we may enter intoforeign exchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain localcurrency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in thevalue of foreign currencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currencyfluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. Our entry into hedge agreementsmay not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreigncurrency exchange rates      We enter into hedge agreementsfrom time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreigncurrency exchange rate volatility. These agreements involve risks, such as therisk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under thesearrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducingour exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a risk that we willnot complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap is intended tohedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adverselyaffected. Risks Arising from Our Status asa REIT We might fail to qualify orremain qualified as a REIT      We intend to operate as a REITunder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believewe have and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status asa REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantiallyreduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distributionto our stockholders because:•         we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders incomputing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax atregular corporate rates;•         we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possiblyincreased state and local taxes; and•         unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we couldnot elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following theyear during which we were disqualified.      Since REIT qualification requires us to meet anumber of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfillthem, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federaland other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect theamount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT,we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REITis not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REITstatus or avoid an excise tax. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT,all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends tothe extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, althoughcorporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction,and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generallyapplicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 20%) withrespect to distributions.      As a result of all thesefactors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability toimplement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of ourcommon stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highlytechnical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicialand administrative interpretations. The determination of various factualmatters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect ourability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as aREIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualifiedas a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain subsidiaries mightfail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT 20      Weown interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as REITsfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, some of which we consolidate forfinancial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate REITfor federal income tax purposes (each a “Subsidiary REIT”).  To qualify as aREIT, each Subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REITqualification requirements under the Code, together with all other rulesapplicable to REITs.  Provided that each Subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT,our interests in the Subsidiary REITs will be treated as qualifying real estateassets for purposes of the REIT asset tests.  If a Subsidiary REIT fails toqualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT will be subject tofederal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for thefour subsequent taxable years.  Any such failure could have an adverse effecton our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus ourability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certainrelief provisions. The 90% annual distributionrequirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage inotherwise beneficial transactions      To comply with the 90%distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductibleexcise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Although weanticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets toenable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that,from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets tomeet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may decide to retain cash or distributesuch greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation.This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income andactual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion ofthat income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income,on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principalamortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cashdeductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets toenable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timingdifferences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrowfunds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you thatwe will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distributeother property or securities or engage in another transaction intended toenable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us toraise additional capital to meet our obligations. The lease of qualified healthcare properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements      We lease certain qualifiedhealth care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liabilitycompanies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lesseescontract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health careoperations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiarylessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) theyare paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a qualified health care propertywith a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligibleindependent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions arenot satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. If certain sale-leasebacktransactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as“true leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences      We have purchased certainproperties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we mayenter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any suchsale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the leasewill be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated asthe owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However,depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take theposition that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properlytreated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction ischallenged and successfully re-characterized by the IRS, we would not beentitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner ofproperty. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were sore-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income testsand, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year ofre-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income couldbe recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annualdistribution requirements for a taxable year. We could be subject tochanges in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international taxlegislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities      We are subject to taxes in theU.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  Our analysis of the Tax Act may be impacted byany corrective legislation and any guidance provided by the U.S. Treasury, the IRSor by the General Explanation of the Tax Act, which is under preparation by theStaff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.  Our effective taxrates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries withdiffering statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assetsand liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.  We are alsosubject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the IRSand other tax authorities and governmental bodies.  We regularly assess thelikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determinethe adequacy of our provision for taxes.  There can be no assurance as to theoutcome of these examinations.  If we were subject to review or examination bythe IRS or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax lawchanges (including the recently enacted Tax Act) the ultimate determination ofwhich may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previouslyaccrued or recorded, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flowscould be adversely affected.21  "
2,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2017-02-22,"Risk Factors
      This section discusses themost significant factors that affect our business, operations and financialcondition. It does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us,our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, aswell as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that wecurrently think are not material, actually occur, we could be materiallyadversely affected. In that event, the value of our securities could decline.We group these risk factors into three categories:•         Risks arising from our business;•         Risks arising from our capital structure; and •         Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our Business Our investments in andacquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessfulor fail to meet our expectations      We are exposed to the riskthat some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We couldencounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquiredproperties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties mightrequire significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to ourongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to anoperator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps toensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect ourresults of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that ouranticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject tovarious conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing,on anticipated terms, or at all.  We also may be unable to quickly andefficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfoliosof properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverseeffect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our investments in jointventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control overthese investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet theirobligations and disputes between us and our partners25        We have entered into, and maycontinue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with otherpersons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not bepresent with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that ourpartner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when dueor otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilitiesto us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any timehave economic or other business interests or goals that are or becomeinconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in adispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional resourcesto resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations andprofitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may be in a positionto take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests. Inaddition, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a thirdparty may be restricted. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have theright to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell ourinterest, or acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when we otherwise wouldnot have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’sinterest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowingcapacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sellour interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it.Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with ourpartners, which could limit our ability to control the properties in the jointventures. Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions mayrequire partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of aproperty. We are exposed to operationalrisks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that couldadversely affect our revenue and operations       We are exposed to variousoperational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties thatmay increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and Medicaidreimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions;competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certificationand inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increasesin cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; stateregulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and theavailability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization orotherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect ourrevenue and operations. Decreases in our operators’revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ability to make payments to us      Our operators’ revenues areprimarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaidreimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarilydriven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent ordebt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to,come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.Operating costs continue to increase for our operators. To the extent that anydecrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in aproperty not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of ouroperator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To theextent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record animpairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of anunderperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairmentor loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results. Increased competition mayaffect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us        The operators of ourproperties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of propertiesand other health care providers that provide comparable services. We cannot becertain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve andmaintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of theirobligations to us. Our operators are expected to encounter increasedcompetition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residentsor expand their businesses. A severe cold and flu season,epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect theoccupancy of our seniors housing operating and triple-net properties      Our and our operators’revenues are dependent on occupancy.  It is impossible to predict the severityof the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any otherwidespread illnesses.  The occupancy of our seniors housing operating andtriple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severecold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness.  Such adecrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operatingproperties and the ability of our triple-net operators to make payments to us. The insolvency or bankruptcyof our obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition      We are exposed to the riskthat our obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest orother payments due us, which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency,or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency 26  proceedings for other reasons. Although our operatinglease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediatepayment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with theright to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment ofprincipal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise otherremedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a partythat has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy orsubject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability tocollect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal andinterest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. Wemay be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes andmaintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid theimposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant.In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet theproperty to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have providedworking capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If wecannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession ofthat property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Shouldsuch events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adverselyaffected. We may not be able to timelyreinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us      From time to time, we willhave cash available from (1) the proceeds of sales of our securities, (2)principal payments on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases orsimilar financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenuesand continue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest theseproceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with abroad variety of potential investors. This competition for attractiveinvestments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments onterms acceptable to us. Failure to properly manageour rapid growth could distract our management or increase ourexpenses      We have experienced rapidgrowth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect tocontinue this rapid growth in the future. This growth has resulted in increasedlevels of responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions couldplace significant additional demands on, and require us to expand, ourmanagement, resources and personnel. Our failure to manage any such rapidgrowth effectively could harm our business and, in particular, our financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows, which could negatively affectour ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our growth could alsoincrease our capital requirements, which may require us to issue potentiallydilutive equity securities and incur additional debt. We depend on GenesisHealthcare, LLC (“Genesis”) and Brookdale Senior Living for a significantportion of our revenues and any inability or unwillingness by Genesis andBrookdale Senior Living to satisfy their obligations under their agreementswith us could adversely affect us      The properties we lease toGenesis and Brookdale Senior Living account for a significant portion of ourrevenues, and because our leases with Genesis and Brookdale Senior Living aretriple-net leases, we also depend on Genesis and Brookdale Senior Living to payall insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses inconnection with the leased properties. We cannot assure you that Genesis andBrookdale Senior Living will have sufficient assets, income and access tofinancing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy theirrespective obligations under our leases, and any inability or unwillingness byGenesis or Brookdale Senior Living to do so could have an adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Genesis and BrookdaleSenior Living have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless fromand against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connectionwith their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that Genesis andBrookdale Senior Living will have sufficient assets, income, access tofinancing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respectiveindemnification obligations.  Genesis and Brookdale Senior Living’s failure toeffectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our propertiescould adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attractand retain patients and residents in our properties, which, in turn, couldadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The properties managed bySunrise Senior Living, LLC account for a significant portion of our revenuesand operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financialcondition could adversely affect us      Sunrise Senior Living, LLCmanages our entire Sunrise property portfolio, which as of December 31, 2016,consisted of 157 seniors housing properties.  These properties account for asignificant portion of our revenues, and we rely on Sunrise Senior Living, LLCto manage these properties efficiently and effectively.  We also rely onSunrise Senior Living, LLC to set appropriate resident fees, to provideaccurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely mannerand to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our managementagreements and all applicable laws and regulations.  Any adverse developmentsin Sunrise Senior Living, LLC’s business or financial condition could impairits ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively, which couldadversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Also, if Sunrise Senior Living, LLC experiences any significant financial,legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could resultin, among other things, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of itscontinued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by oragainst it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which, in turn, could adverselyaffect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 27   Ownership of property outsidethe United States may subject us to different or greater risks than thoseassociated with our domestic operations      We have operations in Canadaand the United Kingdom. International development, ownership, and operatingactivities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect toour domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are notlimited to, any international currency gain recognized with respect to changesin exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95%gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify andmaintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect tothe repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political,regulatory, and economic conditions, including regionally, nationally, andlocally, including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s June 2016 vote toexit the European Union (commonly known as “Brexit”); challenges in managinginternational operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety offoreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate,corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil andcriminal legal proceedings; foreign ownershiprestrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences in lendingpractices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to providefinancing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political andeconomic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws andregulations in the United States that affect foreign operations, including, butnot limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are unable tosuccessfully manage the risks associated with international expansion andoperations, our results of operations and financial condition may be adverselyaffected. We do not know if our tenantswill renew their existing leases, and if they do not, we may beunable to lease the properties on as favorable terms, or at all      We cannot predict whether ourtenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, whichexpire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be requiredto find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them. There can be noassurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants orenter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the currentleases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our operators and managers may not have thenecessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses      We maintain or require ouroperators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on ourproperties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductiblesthat we believe are customary for similarly-situated companies in our industry,and we continually review our insurance programs and requirements.  That said,we cannot assure you that we or our operators or managers will continue to beable to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages, whichcould adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss.  Also,in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators andmanagers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size ofpatient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liabilitycosts have increased in some markets. General and professional liabilityinsurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affectthe property operators’ and managers’ future operations, cash flows and financial condition, andmay have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ and managers’ability to meet their obligations to us.   Our ownership of propertiesthrough ground leases exposes us to the loss of such propertiesupon breach or termination of the ground leases      We have acquired an interestin certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the propertyon which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties inthe future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. As the lesseeunder a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the propertyupon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground leaseby us. The requirements of, orchanges to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid,could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financialcondition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ability to meet their obligations to us      Some of our obligors’businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that anoperator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmentpayors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject tostatutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery ofprogram overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings,policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries orcarriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respectto specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due to anyongoing government investigations and audits at such property. In recent years,government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers dueto budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be ofparamount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make anyassessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reformsmay have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There canbe no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available 28  for services provided by any property operator, whetherthe property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors.Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursementrates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity,financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect theability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us.       The Patient Protection andAffordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and EducationReconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), providesthose states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible stateresidents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with anincreased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014,when certain conditions are met. Given that the federal governmentsubstantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states willultimately pursue this option, although, as of early February 2017, more thanhalf of the states have expanded Medicaid coverage. The participation by statesin the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and theirability to pay our tenants. We expect that the new Presidential Administrationand U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, orcertain provisions of, the Health Reform Laws, including Medicaid expansion.Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of allor portions of the Health Reform Laws.  The House and Senate have recentlypassed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draftlegislation to repeal all or portions of the Health Reform Laws and permitssuch legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate.  President Trumphas also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is hisAdministration’s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the Health Reform Laws anddirected executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grantexemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of Health ReformLaws to the maximum extent permitted by law.  There is still uncertainty withrespect to the impact President Trump’s Administration and the U.S. Congressmay have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and couldhave an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and servicescovered by plans that were authorized by the Health Reform Laws.  We cannotpredict whether the existing Health Reform Laws, or future health care reformlegislation or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on ouroperators’ or tenants’ property or business.  If the operations, cash flows orfinancial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adverselyimpacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operationsmay be adversely affected as well.  See “Item 1 — Business — Certain GovernmentRegulations — United States — Reimbursement”above.                                                                                                                                                             More generally, and because ofthe dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for healthcare products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit andbudgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reachinglegislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our businessor that of our operators and tenants. Our operators’ or tenants’failure to comply with federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adverselyaffect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect ouroperators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us       Our operators and tenantsgenerally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, andindustry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations,and standards. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of theselaws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denialof reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusionfrom federal and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of thefacility. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ abilityto make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. See “Item 1 —Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Fraud & AbuseEnforcement” above.      Many of our properties mayrequire a license, registration, and/or certificate of need (“CON”) to operate.Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a requiredlicense, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in themanner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materiallyadversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments tous. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the additionof new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and theconstruction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON orother similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — CertainGovernment Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. Illiquidity of real estateinvestments could significantly impede our ability to respond toadverse changes in the performance of our properties      Real estate investments arerelatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of ourproperties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will belimited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for anyproperty that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. Our inability torespond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financialcondition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risksinherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, theseniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estateindustry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability tosell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. 29  Unfavorableresolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have amaterial adverse effect on our financial condition      From time to time, we may bedirectly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of ouractions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which suchoperators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold usharmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising inconnection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution ofpending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of itsoutcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses andsignificantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurancethat we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of,pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or futurelitigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead toincreased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. Development, redevelopmentand construction risks could affect our profitability      At any given time, we may bein the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately willrequire a CON and license before they can be utilized by the operator for theirintended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaidcertification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/orthird party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtainthe necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contractsafter the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be ableto earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtainsa license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessaryprovider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operatorthat is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended useand the necessary provider agreements or contracts.      In connection with ourrenovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, wemay be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning,land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits andauthorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or ourabandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be able to obtainfinancing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with ourdevelopment activities, and we may not be able to complete construction andlease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debtservice expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame requiredfor development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that wemay have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required tomake cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operationsor refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional moneyto fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may notproduce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overallfinancial performance.      In deciding whether to acquireor develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expectedfuture performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return onour investment based on expected occupancy, rental rates and capital costs. Ifour financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as aresult of increases in capital costs or other factors, the property may fail toperform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costsof repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to beinaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals.Additionally, we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased, and thecash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operatingexpenses and debt service associated with that property. We mayexperience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters,which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, adecrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital wehave invested in a property      We maintainor require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on ourproperties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe areappropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and wecontinually review our insurance programs and requirements. However, a large numberof our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenueloss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or naturaldisasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods. We believe,given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants,that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonablyanticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes,floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters. Nevertheless,we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover alllosses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on ourproperties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses.These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance,a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss ofall or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property.  Inaddition, we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certaincircumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or our tenants’judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss. We may incur costs toremediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have anadverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 30       Undervarious federal and state laws, owners or operators of real estate may berequired to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on theproperty and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries orpenalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardoussubstances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costsit incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liabilityattaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property. Ourtenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of theproperty. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the propertiesthat we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessmentsare designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believequalifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilitiesarise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of ourproperties are subject to material environmental contamination. However,environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incurcosts to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect onour business or financial condition or the business or financial condition ofour obligors. Cybersecurity incidents coulddisrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information       Our business is at risk fromand may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gainunauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic securitybreaches. Such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gainunauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticatedsecurity threats. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect andmitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successfulin preventing a cyber attack. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt ourbusiness and compromise the confidential information of our employees,operators and tenants. Actual or threatenedterrorist attacks could adversely affect the occupancy and the value of our properties      We have significantinvestments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in thefuture the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including Boston,Chicago, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. As a result, some of our tenants in these markets may choose to relocate toother markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of futureterrorist activity.  This could result in an overall decrease in the occupancyof our properties.  In addition, terrorist attacks could also result insignificant damages to, or loss of, our properties, which could exceed ourinsurance coverage. Our certificate ofincorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions      Our certificate ofincorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions onshare ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approvalrequirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult foror even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of ourincumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit ordiscourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. Our success depends on keypersonnel whose continued service is not guaranteed      We are dependent on keypersonnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with ourexecutive officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have anadverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more than one couldhave a material adverse impact on our business. Risks Arising from Our CapitalStructure We may become more leveraged      Permanent financing for ourinvestments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings ofdebt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become moreleveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cashflow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturnin the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, or (4)negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the ratingagencies. We are subject to covenantsin our debt agreements that may restrict or limit our operations andacquisitions and our failure to comply with the covenants in our debtagreements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition      Our debt agreements containvarious covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things,these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimumnet worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenantscould result in defaults under the instruments governing the 31  applicable indebtedness, in addition to any otherindebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These defaults couldhave a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Limitations on our ability toaccess capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make futureinvestments or to meet our obligations and commitments      We cannot assure you that wewill be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or tomeet our obligations and commitments as they mature.  Our access to capitaldepends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control,including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions;the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potentialfuture earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of ourcapital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; the financialstability of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet theircommitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us; changesin the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; or default or delayin payment by the United States of its obligations. If our access to capital islimited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact ourability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fundoperations or make distributions to our stockholders. Downgrades in our creditratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability ofcapital      We plan to manage the Companyto maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but therecan be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current creditratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of therating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost andavailability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact onour consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Fluctuations in the value offoreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial position      As we expand our operationsinternationally, currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our resultsof operations and financial position. We expect to generate an increasingportion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the Canadiandollar and the British pound. Although we may enter into foreign exchangeagreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgagedebt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreigncurrencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will nothave a material adverse effect on us. Our entry into swapagreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest ratesor foreign currency exchange rates      We enter into swap agreementsfrom time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreigncurrency exchange rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such asthe risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under thesearrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducingour exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a risk that we willnot complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap is intended tohedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adverselyaffected. Risks Arising from Our Status asa REIT We might fail to qualify orremain qualified as a REIT      We intend to operate as a REITunder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believewe have and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status asa REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantiallyreduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distributionto our stockholders because:•         we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders incomputing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax atregular corporate rates;•         we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possiblyincreased state and local taxes; and•         unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we couldnot elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following theyear during which we were disqualified.      Since REIT qualification requires us to meet anumber of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfillthem, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federaland other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect theamount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT,we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REITis not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REITstatus or avoid an excise tax. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — FederalIncome Tax Considerations” above for a discussion of the provisions of the Codethat apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT. In addition,if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders wouldcontinue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current andaccumulated earnings and 32  profits, although corporatestockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, andindividual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generallyapplicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 20%) withrespect to distributions.      As a result of all thesefactors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability toimplement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of ourcommon stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highlytechnical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicialand administrative interpretations. The determination of various factualmatters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect ourability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as aREIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualifiedas a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Item 1 — Business —Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations” above. Certain subsidiaries mightfail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT      We own interests in a numberof entities which have elected to be taxed as REITs for federal income taxpurposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes buteach of which is treated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes(each a “Subsidiary REIT”).  To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT mustindependently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under theCode, together with all other rules applicable to REITs.  Provided that eachSubsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in the Subsidiary REITs willbe treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the REIT assettests.  See “Item 1 – Business – Taxation – Federal Income Tax Considerations –Qualification as a REIT – Asset Tests” above.  If a Subsidiary REIT fails toqualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT will be subject tofederal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for thefour subsequent taxable years.  Any such failure could have an adverse effecton our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus ourability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certainrelief provisions. The 90% annual distributionrequirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage inotherwise beneficial transactions      To comply with the 90%distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductibleexcise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as aREIT — Annual Distribution Requirements” above. Although we anticipate that wegenerally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfythe REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, wemay not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%distribution requirement, or we may decide to retain cash or distribute suchgreater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. Thismay be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income andactual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion ofthat income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income,on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principalamortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cashdeductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets toenable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timingdifferences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrowfunds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you thatwe will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distributeother property or securities or engage in another transaction intended toenable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us toraise additional capital to meet our obligations. The lease of qualified healthcare properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements      We lease certain qualifiedhealth care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liabilitycompanies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lesseescontract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health careoperations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiarylessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) theyare paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a qualified health care propertywith a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligibleindependent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions arenot satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as aREIT — Income Tests” above. If certain sale-leasebacktransactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service as “trueleases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences      We have purchased certainproperties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we mayenter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any suchsale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the leasewill be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated asthe owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However,depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the Internal RevenueService might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” butis more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leasebacktransaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the InternalRevenue Service, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions fordepreciation and 33  cost recovery generally available to an owner ofproperty. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized,we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and,consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year ofre-characterization. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income TaxConsiderations — Qualification as a REIT — Asset Tests” and “Item 1 — Business— Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT —Income Tests” above. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income couldbe recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annualdistribution requirements for a taxable year. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation— Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — AnnualDistribution Requirements” above. The new PresidentialAdministration may propose substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies that,if enacted, may adversely affect REITs and our business      The recently inaugurated U.S.President and his Administration have called for substantial changes to fiscaland tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform. We cannot predictthe impact, if any, of such tax reform to REITs or to our business.  It ispossible that any comprehensive tax reform could adversely affect REITs ingeneral or our business specifically.  Until any such tax reform changesare enacted, we will not know whether we will benefit from, or will benegatively affected by, such changes.  "
13,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2016-02-18,"Risk Factors
      This section discusses themost significant factors that affect our business, operations and financialcondition. It does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us,our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, aswell as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that wecurrently think are not material, actually occur, we could be materiallyadversely affected. In that event, the value of our securities could decline.      We group these risk factorsinto three categories: •         Risks arising from our business; •         Risks arising from our capital structure; and  •         Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our Business Our investments in andacquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessfulor fail to meet our expectations      We are exposed to the riskthat some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We couldencounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquiredproperties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties mightrequire significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to ourongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to anoperator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps toensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect ourresults of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that ouranticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject tovarious conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing,on anticipated terms, or at all.  We also may be unable to quickly andefficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfoliosof properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverseeffect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our investments in jointventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control overthese investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet theirobligations and disputes between us and our partners      We have entered into, and maycontinue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with otherpersons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not bepresent with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that ourpartner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when dueor otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certainliabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner mightat any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are orbecome inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged ina dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additionalresources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on theoperations and profitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may bein a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructionsor requests. In addition, our ability to transfer our interest in a jointventure to a third party may be restricted. In some instances, we and/or ourpartner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could causeus to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when weotherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquireour partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, availableborrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may be forcedto sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer toretain it. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authoritywith our partners, which could limit our ability to control the properties inthe joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest, certain majordecisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition orfinancing of a property. We are exposed to operationalrisks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that couldadversely affect our revenue and operations 34       We are exposed to variousoperational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties thatmay increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and Medicaidreimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions;competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availabilityand increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage;state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and the availabilityand increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise).Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue andoperations. Decreases in our operators’revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ability to make payments to us      Our operators’ revenues areprimarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaidreimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarilydriven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent ordebt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to,come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.Operating costs continue to increase for our operators. To the extent that anydecrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in aproperty not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of ouroperator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To theextent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record animpairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of anunderperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairmentor loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results. Increased competition mayaffect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us        The operators of ourproperties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of propertiesand other health care providers that provide comparable services. We cannot becertain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve andmaintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of theirobligations to us. Our operators are expected to encounter increasedcompetition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residentsor expand their businesses. A severe cold and flu season,epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect theoccupancy of our seniors housing operating and triple-net properties      Our and our operators’revenues are dependent on occupancy.  It is impossible to predict the severityof the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any otherwidespread illnesses.  The occupancy of our seniors housing operating andtriple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severecold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness.  Such adecrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operatingproperties and the ability of our triple-net operators to make payments to us. The insolvency or bankruptcyof our obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition      We are exposed to the riskthat our obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest orother payments due us, which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency,or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedingsfor other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with theright to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise otherremedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any fundingobligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest,foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy andinsolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcyor reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvencyproceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent inthe case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case ofa loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies.      We may be required to fundcertain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve thevalue of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a propertyand/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we haveterminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. Insome of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limitedindemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased propertyto a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose usto certain successor liabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue andoperating cash flow may be adversely affected. We may not be able to timelyreinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us      From time to time, we willhave cash available from (1) the proceeds of sales of our securities, (2)principal payments on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similarfinancial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues andcontinue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest these 35 proceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estateinvestments with a broad variety of potential investors. This competition forattractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timelyinvestments on terms acceptable to us. Failure to properly manageour rapid growth could distract our management or increase ourexpenses      We have experienced rapidgrowth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect tocontinue this rapid growth in the future. This growth has resulted in increasedlevels of responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions couldplace significant additional demands on, and require us to expand, ourmanagement, resources and personnel. Our failure to manage any such rapidgrowth effectively could harm our business and, in particular, our financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows, which could negatively affectour ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our growth could alsoincrease our capital requirements, which may require us to issue potentiallydilutive equity securities and incur additional debt. We depend on GenesisHealthcare, LLC (“Genesis”) for a significant portion of our revenues and anyinability or unwillingness by Genesis to satisfy its obligations under itsagreements with us could adversely affect us      The properties we lease to Genesisaccount for a significant portion of our revenues, and because our leases withGenesis are triple-net leases, we also depend on Genesis to pay all insurance,taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with theleased properties. We cannot assure you that Genesis will have sufficientassets, income and access to financing to enable it to make rental payments tous or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under our leases, and any inabilityor unwillingness by Genesis to do so could have an adverse effect on us.Genesis has also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from andagainst various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection withits business, and we cannot assure you that Genesis will have sufficientassets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it tosatisfy its indemnification obligations. The properties managed bySunrise Senior Living, LLC account for a significant portion of our revenuesand operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financialcondition could adversely affect us      Sunrise Senior Living, LLCmanages our entire Sunrise property portfolio, which as of December 31, 2015,consisted of 152 seniors housing properties.  These properties account for asignificant portion of our revenues, and we rely on Sunrise Senior Living, LLCto manage these properties efficiently and effectively.  Any adversedevelopments in Sunrise Senior Living, LLC’s business or financial conditioncould impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively,which could adversely affect us.  Ownership of property outsidethe United States may subject us to different or greater risks than thoseassociated with our domestic operations      We have operations in Canadaand the United Kingdom. International development, ownership, and operatingactivities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect toour domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limitedto, any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes inexchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% grossincome test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain ourstatus as a REIT; challenges with respect tothe repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political,regulatory, and economic conditions, including regionally, nationally, andlocally; challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complyingwith a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relatingto real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and legalproceedings; foreign ownershiprestrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences in lendingpractices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to providefinancing; regional or country-specific business cycles and economicinstability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in theUnited States that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to,the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are unable to successfully managethe risks associated with international expansion and operations, our resultsof operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. We do not know if our tenantswill renew their existing leases, and if they do not, we may beunable to lease the properties on as favorable terms, or at all      We cannot predict whether ourtenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, whichexpire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be requiredto find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them. There can be noassurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants orenter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the currentleases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our operators’ may not have the necessaryinsurance coverage to insure adequately against losses      In recent years,long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators have experiencedsubstantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liabilityclaims. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased insome markets. General and professional liability insurance coverage may berestricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the property operators’ 36 future operations,cash flows and financial condition, and may have a material adverse effect onthe property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us.   Our ownership of propertiesthrough ground leases exposes us to the loss of such propertiesupon breach or termination of the ground leases      We have acquired an interestin certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the propertyon which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties inthe future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. As the lesseeunder a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the propertyupon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground leaseby us. The requirements of, orchanges to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid,could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financialcondition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ability to meet their obligations to us      Some of our obligors’businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that anoperator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmentpayors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject tostatutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery ofprogram overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings,policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries orcarriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respectto specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due to anyongoing government investigations and audits at such property. In recent years,government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers dueto budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be ofparamount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make anyassessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reformsmay have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There canbe no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available forservices provided by any property operator, whether the property receivesreimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits onthe scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could havea material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition andresults of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligorto meet its obligations to us. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain GovernmentRegulations — United States — Reimbursement” above.      The Patient Protection andAffordable Care Act of 2010, as modified by the Health Care and EducationReconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), providesthose states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible stateresidents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with anincreased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014,when certain conditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States SupremeCourt upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partiallyinvalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allowsstates to elect not to participate in the expansion—and to forego funding forthe Medicaid expansion—without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Giventhat the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it isunclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as ofearly February 2016, roughly half of the states have expanded Medicaidcoverage. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have thedual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, butfurther straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants. While thefederal government will pay for approximately 100% of those additional costsfrom 2014 through 2016, states will be expected to pay for part of thoseadditional costs beginning in 2017. In light of this, at least one state thathas passed legislation to allow the state to expand its Medicaid coverage hasincluded sunset provisions in the legislation that require that the expandedbenefits be reduced or eliminated if the federal government’s funding for theprogram is decreased or eliminated, permitting the state to re-visit the issueonce it begins to share financial responsibility for the expansion. Withincreasingly strained budgets, it is unclear how states that do not includesuch sunset provisions will pay their share of these additional Medicaid costsand what other health care expenditures could be reduced as a result. Asignificant reduction in other health care related spending by states to payfor increased Medicaid costs could affect our tenants’ revenue streams. See“Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States —Reimbursement” above.      More generally, and because ofthe dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for healthcare products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit andbudgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reachinglegislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our businessor that of our operators and tenants. Our operators’ or tenants’failure to comply with federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adverselyaffect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect ouroperators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us       Our operators and tenantsgenerally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, andindustry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations,and standards. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of theselaws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denialof reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusionfrom federal and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of thefacility. Such actions may have an effect on 37 ouroperators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore,adversely impact us. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations —United States — Other Related Laws, Initiatives, and Considerations” above.      Many of our properties mayrequire a license, registration, and/or certificate of need (“CON”) to operate.Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a requiredlicense, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in themanner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materiallyadversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments tous. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including theaddition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and theconstruction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON orother similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — CertainGovernment Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. Illiquidity of real estateinvestments could significantly impede our ability to respond toadverse changes in the performance of our properties      Real estate investments arerelatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of ourproperties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will belimited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for anyproperty that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. Our inability torespond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financialcondition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risksinherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, theseniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estateindustry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability tosell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Unfavorable resolution ofpending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition      From time to time, we may bedirectly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of ouractions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which suchoperators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold usharmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising inconnection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution ofpending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of itsoutcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses andsignificantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurancethat we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of,pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or futurelitigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead toincreased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. Development, redevelopmentand construction risks could affect our profitability      At any given time, we may bein the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately willrequire a CON and license before they can be utilized by the operator for theirintended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaidcertification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/orthird party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtainthe necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contractsafter the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be ableto earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtainsa license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessaryprovider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operatorthat is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended useand the necessary provider agreements or contracts.      In connection with ourrenovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, wemay be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning,land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits andauthorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or ourabandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be able to obtainfinancing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with ourdevelopment activities, and we may not be able to complete construction andlease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debtservice expense or construction costs.      Additionally, the time framerequired for development, construction and lease-up of these properties meansthat we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are requiredto make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow fromoperations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrowadditional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquiredproperties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adverselyaffect our overall financial performance.      In deciding whether to acquireor develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expectedfuture performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return onour investment based on expected occupancy, rental rates and capital costs. Ifour financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as aresult of increases in capital costs or other factors, the property may fail toperform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costsof repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to beinaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals.Additionally, we may 38 acquire new properties that arenot fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may beinsufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated withthat property. We mayexperience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters,which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, adecrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital wehave invested in a property      We maintainor require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on ourproperties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe areappropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and wecontinually review our insurance programs and requirements. However, a largenumber of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible torevenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions ornatural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods. Webelieve, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outsideconsultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate tocover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes,earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions and naturaldisasters. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurancewill not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event andthe impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portionof the losses. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affectedproperty and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in anaffected property.  In addition, we or our tenants may not purchase insuranceunder certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or ourtenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss. We may incur costs toremediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have anadverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition      Under various federal andstate laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond tothe presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be heldliable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result fromenvironmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. We may becomeliable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs inconnection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to aperson based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants orborrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property.Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that weown or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments aredesigned to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believequalifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilitiesarise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of ourproperties are subject to material environmental contamination. However,environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur coststo remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness or financial condition or the business or financial condition of ourobligors. Cybersecurity incidents coulddisrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information       Our business is at risk fromand may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gainunauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic securitybreaches. Such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorizedaccess to our information technology systems to more sophisticated securitythreats. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigatethese threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful inpreventing a cyber attack. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our businessand compromise the confidential information of our employees, operators andtenants. Our certificate ofincorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions      Our certificate of incorporationand by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions on share ownershipand transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for businesscombinations) that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a thirdparty from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent Board ofDirectors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeoverattempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. Our success depends on keypersonnel whose continued service is not guaranteed      We are dependent on keypersonnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with ourexecutive officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have anadverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more than one couldhave a material adverse impact on our business. Risks Arising from Our CapitalStructure We may become more leveraged 39     Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through acombination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and theincurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption ofindebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require usto dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service,(2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our abilityto obtain additional financing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings oroutlook by one or more of the rating agencies. We are subject to covenantsin our debt agreements that may restrict or limit our operations andacquisitions and our failure to comply with the covenants in our debtagreements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition      Our debt agreements containvarious covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things,these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimumnet worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenantscould result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicableindebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted againstsuch instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability toaccess capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make futureinvestments or to meet our obligations and commitments      We cannot assure you that wewill be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or tomeet our obligations and commitments as they mature.  Our access to capitaldepends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, includingrising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions; themarket’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potentialfuture earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of ourcapital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; the financialstability of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet theircommitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us; changesin the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; or default or delayin payment by the United States of its obligations. If our access to capital islimited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact ourability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operationsor make distributions to our stockholders. Downgrades in our creditratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability ofcapital      We plan to manage the Companyto maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but therecan be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current creditratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of therating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost andavailability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact onour consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Fluctuations in the value offoreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial position      As we expand our operationsinternationally, currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our resultsof operations and financial position. We expect to generate an increasingportion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the Canadiandollar and the British pound. Although we may enter into foreign exchangeagreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgagedebt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreigncurrencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will nothave a material adverse effect on us. Our entry into swapagreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest ratesor foreign currency exchange rates      We enter into swap agreementsfrom time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreigncurrency exchange rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such asthe risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under thesearrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducingour exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a risk that we willnot complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap is intended tohedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adverselyaffected. Risks Arising from Our Status asa REIT We might fail to qualify orremain qualified as a REIT      We intend to operate as a REITunder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believewe have and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status asa REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantiallyreduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distributionto our stockholders because:40  •         we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders incomputing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax atregular corporate rates;•         we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possiblyincreased state and local taxes; and•         unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we couldnot elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following theyear during which we were disqualified.      Since REIT qualification requires us to meet anumber of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfillthem, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federaland other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect theamount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT,we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REITis not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REITstatus or avoid an excise tax. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — FederalIncome Tax Considerations” above for a discussion of the provisions of the Codethat apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT.      In addition, if we fail toqualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would continue to betreated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings andprofits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation atthe rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at amaximum rate of 20%) with respect to distributions.      As a result of all thesefactors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability toimplement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of ourcommon stock.      Qualification as a REITinvolves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions forwhich there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. Thedetermination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely withinour control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although webelieve that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continueto qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations” above. Certain subsidiaries mightfail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT      We own interests in a numberof entities which have elected to be taxed as REITs for federal income taxpurposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but eachof which is treated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes (each a“Subsidiary REIT”).  To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT mustindependently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under theCode, together with all other rules applicable to REITs.  Provided that eachSubsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in the Subsidiary REITs willbe treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the REIT assettests.  See “Item 1 – Business – Taxation – Federal Income Tax Considerations –Qualification as a REIT – Asset Tests” above.  If a Subsidiary REIT fails toqualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT will be subject tofederal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for thefour subsequent taxable years.  Any such failure could have an adverse effecton our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus ourability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certainrelief provisions. The 90% annual distributionrequirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage inotherwise beneficial transactions      To comply with the 90%distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductibleexcise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT— Annual Distribution Requirements” above. Although we anticipate that wegenerally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfythe REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, wemay not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%distribution requirement, or we may decide to retain cash or distribute suchgreater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. Thismay be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income andactual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion ofthat income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income,on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principalamortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cashdeductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets toenable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timingdifferences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrowfunds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you thatwe will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distributeother property or securities or engage in another transaction intended toenable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us toraise additional capital to meet our obligations. The lease of qualified healthcare properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements 41      Welease certain qualified health care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (orlimited liability companies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries aremembers), which lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to managethe health care operations at these properties. The rents from this taxableREIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from realproperty if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a qualifiedhealth care property with a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the managerqualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). Ifany of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not bequalifying rents. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income TaxConsiderations — Qualification as a REIT — Income Tests”above. If certain sale-leasebacktransactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service as “trueleases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences      We have purchased certainproperties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we mayenter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any suchsale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease willbe characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as theowner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, dependingon the terms of any specific transaction, the Internal Revenue Service mighttake the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is moreproperly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leasebacktransaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the InternalRevenue Service, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions fordepreciation and cost recoverygenerally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leasebacktransaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT assettests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effectivewith the year of re-characterization. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation —Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Asset Tests” and“Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualificationas a REIT — Income Tests” above. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxableincome could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REITannual distribution requirements for a taxable year. See “Item 1 — Business —Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — AnnualDistribution Requirements” above.  "
6,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2015-02-20,"Risk Factors
      This section discusses themost significant factors that affect our business, operations and financialcondition. It does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us,our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, aswell as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that wecurrently think are not material, actually occur, we could be materiallyadversely affected. In that event, the value of our securities could decline.      We group these risk factorsinto three categories: •         Risks arising from our business; •         Risks arising from our capital structure; and  •         Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our Business 30 Ourinvestments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing propertiesmay be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations      We are exposed to the riskthat some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounterunanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquiredproperties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties mightrequire significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to ourongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to anoperator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps toensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect ourresults of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that ouranticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject tovarious conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing,on anticipated terms, or at all.  We also may be unable to quickly and efficientlyintegrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios ofproperties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effecton our results of operations and financial condition. Our investments in jointventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control overthese investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet theirobligations and disputes between us and our partners      We have entered into, and maycontinue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with otherpersons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not bepresent with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that ourpartner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when dueor otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certainliabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner mightat any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are orbecome inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engagedin a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additionalresources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on theoperations and profitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may bein a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructionsor requests. In addition, our ability to transfer our interest in a jointventure to a third party may be restricted. In some instances, we and/or ourpartner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could causeus to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when weotherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquireour partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash,available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we maybe forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwiseprefer to retain it. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-makingauthority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control theproperties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest,certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisitionor financing of a property. We are exposed to operationalrisks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that couldadversely affect our revenue and operations       We are exposed to variousoperational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties thatmay increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and Medicaidreimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions;competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availabilityand increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage;state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; and theavailability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization orotherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect ourrevenue and operations. Decreases in our operators’revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ability to make payments to us      Our operators’ revenues areprimarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaidreimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarilydriven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent ordebt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to,come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.Operating costs continue to increase for our operators. To the extent that anydecrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in aproperty not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operatorand the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extentthe value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment forsuch asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperformingproperty, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on salewould negatively affect our financial results. Increased competition mayaffect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us        The operators of ourproperties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of propertiesand other health care providers that provide comparable services. We cannot becertain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve andmaintain 31 occupancy and rate levels that will enable themto meet all of their obligations to us. Our operators are expected to encounterincreased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attractresidents or expand their businesses. The insolvency or bankruptcyof our obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition      We are exposed to the riskthat our obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest orother payments due us, which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency,or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedingsfor other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with theright to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise otherremedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any fundingobligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest,foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy andinsolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcyor reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvencyproceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent inthe case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case ofa loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies.      We may be required to fundcertain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve thevalue of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a propertyand/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we haveterminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. Insome of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limitedindemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased propertyto a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose usto certain successor liabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue andoperating cash flow may be adversely affected. We may not be able to timelyreinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us      From time to time, we willhave cash available from (1) the proceeds of sales of our securities, (2)principal payments on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases orsimilar financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenuesand continue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest theseproceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with abroad variety of potential investors. This competition for attractiveinvestments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments onterms acceptable to us. Failure to properly manageour rapid growth could distract our management or increase ourexpenses      We have experienced rapidgrowth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect tocontinue this rapid growth in the future. This growth has resulted in increasedlevels of responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions couldplace significant additional demands on, and require us to expand, ourmanagement, resources and personnel. Our failure to manage any such rapidgrowth effectively could harm our business and, in particular, our financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows, which could negatively affectour ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our growth could alsoincrease our capital requirements, which may require us to issue potentiallydilutive equity securities and incur additional debt. We depend on GenesisHealthcare, LLC (“Genesis”) for a significant portion of our revenues and anyinability or unwillingness by Genesis to satisfy its obligations under itsagreements with us could adversely affect us      The properties we lease toGenesis account for a significant portion of our revenues, and because ourleases with Genesis are triple-net leases, we also depend on Genesis to pay allinsurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connectionwith the leased properties. We cannot assure you that Genesis will havesufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to make rentalpayments to us or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under our leases, and anyinability or unwillingness by Genesis to do so could have an adverse effect onus. Genesis has also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from andagainst various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection withits business, and we cannot assure you that Genesis will have sufficientassets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it tosatisfy its indemnification obligations. The properties managed bySunrise Senior Living, LLC account for a significant portion of our revenuesand operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financialcondition could adversely affect us      Sunrise Senior Living, LLCmanages our entire Sunrise property portfolio, which as of December 31, 2014,consisted of 140 seniors housing properties.  These properties account for asignificant portion of our revenues, and we rely on Sunrise Senior Living, LLCto manage these properties efficiently and effectively.  Any adversedevelopments in Sunrise Senior Living, LLC’s business or financial conditioncould impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively,which could adversely affect us.  Ownership of property outsidethe United States may subject us to different or greater risks than thoseassociated with our domestic operations 32      Wehave operations in Canada and the United Kingdom. International development,ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are different from thosewe face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risksinclude, but are not limited to, any international currency gain recognizedwith respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% grossincome test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in orderto qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect tothe repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political,regulatory, and economic conditions, including regionally, nationally, andlocally; challenges in managing international operations; challenges ofcomplying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including thoserelating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employmentand legal proceedings; foreign ownershiprestrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences in lendingpractices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to providefinancing; regional or country-specific business cycles and economicinstability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in theUnited States that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to,the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are unable to successfully managethe risks associated with international expansion and operations, our resultsof operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. We do not know if our tenantswill renew their existing leases, and if they do not, we may beunable to lease the properties on as favorable terms, or at all      We cannot predict whether ourtenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, whichexpire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be requiredto find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them. There can be noassurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants orenter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the currentleases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our operators’ may not have the necessary insurancecoverage to insure adequately against losses      In recent years,long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators have experiencedsubstantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liabilityclaims. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased insome markets. General and professional liability insurance coverage may berestricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the property operators’future operations, cashflows and financial condition, and may have a material adverse effect on theproperty operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us.   Our ownership of propertiesthrough ground leases exposes us to the loss of such propertiesupon breach or termination of the ground leases      We have acquired an interestin certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the propertyon which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties inthe future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. As the lesseeunder a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the propertyupon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground leaseby us. The requirements of, orchanges to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid,could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financialcondition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ability to meet their obligations to us      Some of our obligors’businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that anoperator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmentpayors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutoryand regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of programoverpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policyinterpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers,government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specificfacilities) and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoinggovernment investigations and audits at such property. In recent years,government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers dueto budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be ofparamount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make anyassessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reformsmay have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There canbe no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available forservices provided by any property operator, whether the property receivesreimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits onthe scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could havea material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition andresults of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligorto meet its obligations to us. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain GovernmentRegulations — United States — Reimbursement” above.      The Patient Protection andAffordable Care Act of 2010, as modified by the Health Care and Education ReconciliationAct of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), provides those statesthat expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents withincomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federalmedical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certainconditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheldthe individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated theexpansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allows 33 states to elect not to participate in the expansion—andto forego funding for the Medicaid expansion—without losing their existingMedicaid funding. Given that the federal government substantially funds theMedicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue thisoption, although, as of late January 2015, roughly half of the states haveexpanded Medicaid coverage. The participation by states in the Medicaidexpansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues,through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability topay our tenants. While the federal government will pay for approximately 100%of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states will be expected to pay forpart of those additional costs beginning in 2017. In light of this, at leastone state that has passed legislation to allow the state to expand its Medicaidcoverage has included sunset provisions in the legislation that require thatthe expanded benefits be reduced or eliminated if the federal government’sfunding for the program is decreased or eliminated, permitting the state tore-visit the issue once it begins to share financial responsibility for theexpansion. With increasingly strained budgets, it is unclear how states that donot include such sunset provisions will pay their share of these additionalMedicaid costs and what other health care expenditures could be reduced as aresult. A significant reduction in other health care related spending by statesto pay for increased Medicaid costs could affect our tenants’ revenue streams.See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States —Reimbursement” above.      More generally, and because ofthe dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for healthcare products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit andbudgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reachinglegislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our businessor that of our operators and tenants. Our operators’ or tenants’failure to comply with federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adverselyaffect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect ouroperators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us       Our operators and tenantsgenerally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, andindustry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations,and standards. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of theselaws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denialof reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusionfrom federal and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of thefacility. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ abilityto make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. See “Item 1 —Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Other Related Laws”above.      Many of our properties mayrequire a license, registration, and/or certificate of need (“CON”) to operate.Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a requiredlicense, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in themanner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materiallyadversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments tous. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including theaddition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and theconstruction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON orother similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — CertainGovernment Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. Illiquidity of real estateinvestments could significantly impede our ability to respond toadverse changes in the performance of our properties      Real estate investments arerelatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of ourproperties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will belimited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for anyproperty that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. Our inability torespond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financialcondition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risksinherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, theseniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estateindustry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sellproperties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Unfavorable resolution ofpending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition      From time to time, we may bedirectly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims.We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of ouractions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which suchoperators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold usharmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising inconnection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution ofpending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome,litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantlydivert the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will beable to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or futurelitigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, governmentproceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs orinterruption of our normal business operations. Development, redevelopmentand construction risks could affect our profitability 34      Atany given time, we may be in the process of constructing one or more newfacilities that ultimately will require a CON and license before they can beutilized by the operator for their intended use. The operator also may need toobtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaidprovider agreements and/or third party payor contracts. In the event that theoperator is unable to obtain the necessary CON, licensure, certification,provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction, there isa risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility untileither the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate thenew facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find andcontract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate thefacility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements orcontracts.      In connection with ourrenovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, wemay be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning,land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits andauthorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or ourabandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be able to obtainfinancing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with ourdevelopment activities, and we may not be able to complete construction andlease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debtservice expense or construction costs.      Additionally, the time framerequired for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means thatwe may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are requiredto make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow fromoperations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrowadditional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquiredproperties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adverselyaffect our overall financial performance.      In deciding whether to acquireor develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expectedfuture performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return onour investment based on expected occupancy, rental rates and capital costs. Ifour financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as aresult of increases in capital costs or other factors, the property may fail toperform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costsof repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to beinaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals.Additionally, we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased, and thecash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operatingexpenses and debt service associated with that property. We mayexperience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters,which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, adecrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital wehave invested in a property      We maintainor require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on ourproperties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe areappropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and wecontinually review our insurance programs and requirements. However, a largenumber of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible torevenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions ornatural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods. Webelieve, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outsideconsultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate tocover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes,earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions and naturaldisasters. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurancewill not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event andthe impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significantportion of the losses. These losses may lead to an increase of our and ourtenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from anaffected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we haveinvested in an affected property.  In addition, we or our tenants may notpurchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insuranceexceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative tothe risk of loss. We may incur costs toremediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have anadverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition      Under various federal andstate laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond tothe presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be heldliable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result fromenvironmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. We may becomeliable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs inconnection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to aperson based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants orborrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property.Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that weown or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments aredesigned to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believequalifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilitiesarise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of ourproperties are subject to material environmental contamination. However,environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incurcosts to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect onour business or financial condition or the business or financial condition ofour obligors. Cybersecurity incidents coulddisrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information 35       Our business is at risk fromand may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorizedaccess to our confidential data, and other electronic security breaches. Suchcyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access toour information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats.While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate thesethreats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing acyber attack. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and compromisethe confidential information of our employees, operators and tenants. Our certificate ofincorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions      Our certificate ofincorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions onshare ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approvalrequirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult foror even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of ourincumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit ordiscourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. Our success depends on keypersonnel whose continued service is not guaranteed      We are dependent on keypersonnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with ourexecutive officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have anadverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more than one couldhave a material adverse impact on our business. Risks Arising from Our CapitalStructure We may become more leveraged      Permanent financing for ourinvestments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings ofdebt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become moreleveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cashflow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturnin the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, or (4)negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the ratingagencies. We are subject to covenantsin our debt agreements that may restrict or limit our operations andacquisitions and our failure to comply with the covenants in our debtagreements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition      Our debt agreements containvarious covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things,these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimumnet worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenantscould result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicableindebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted againstsuch instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability toaccess capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make futureinvestments or to meet our obligations and commitments      We cannot assure you that wewill be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or tomeet our obligations and commitments as they mature.  Our access to capitaldepends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control,including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions;the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potentialfuture earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of ourcapital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; the financialstability of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet theircommitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us; changesin the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; or default or delayin payment by the United States of its obligations. If our access to capital islimited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact ourability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fundoperations or make distributions to our stockholders. Downgrades in our creditratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability ofcapital      We plan to manage the Companyto maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but therecan be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current creditratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of therating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost andavailability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact onour consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.36  Fluctuations in the value offoreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial position      As we expand our operationsinternationally, currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our resultsof operations and financial position. We expect to generate an increasingportion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the Canadiandollar and the British pound. Although we may enter into foreign exchangeagreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgagedebt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreigncurrencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will nothave a material adverse effect on us. Our entry into swapagreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest ratesor foreign currency exchange rates      We enter into swap agreementsfrom time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreigncurrency exchange rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such asthe risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under thesearrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducingour exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a risk that we willnot complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap is intended tohedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adverselyaffected. Risks Arising from Our Status asa REIT We might fail to qualify orremain qualified as a REIT      We intend to operate as a REITunder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believewe have and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status asa REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantiallyreduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distributionto our stockholders because: •         we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders incomputing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax atregular corporate rates;•         we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possiblyincreased state and local taxes; and•         unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we couldnot elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following theyear during which we were disqualified.      Since REIT qualification requires us to meet anumber of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfillthem, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federaland other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect theamount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT,we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REITis not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REITstatus or avoid an excise tax. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — FederalIncome Tax Considerations” above for a discussion of the provisions of the Codethat apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT.      In addition, if we fail toqualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would continue to betreated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings andprofits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation atthe rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at amaximum rate of 20%) with respect to distributions.      As a result of all thesefactors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability toimplement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of ourcommon stock.      Qualification as a REITinvolves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions forwhich there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. Thedetermination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely withinour control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although webelieve that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continueto qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations” above. Certain subsidiaries mightfail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT      As a result of our acquisitionof shares in Senior Housing Realty Trust (“SHRT”), we own a minority interestin an entity which elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income taxpurposes.  Additionally, we own substantially all of the outstanding stock of asubsidiary which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but which istreated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes (together with SHRT,each a “Subsidiary REIT”).  To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT mustindependently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under theCode, together with all other rules applicable to REITs.  Provided that each 37 Subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in theSubsidiary REITs will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposesof the REIT asset tests.  See “Item 1 – Business – Taxation – Federal IncomeTax Considerations – Qualification as a REIT – Asset Tests” above.  If aSubsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such SubsidiaryREIT will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able toqualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years.  Any such failurecould have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income andasset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able toavail ourselves of certain relief provisions. The 90% annual distributionrequirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage inotherwise beneficial transactions      To comply with the 90%distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductibleexcise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as aREIT — Annual Distribution Requirements” above. Although we anticipate that wegenerally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfythe REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, wemay not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distributionrequirement, or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amountas may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due totiming differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment ofdeductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income anddeduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the otherhand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization orrepayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may causeus to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or wedeem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additionalequity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to doso), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property orsecurities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet theREIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capitalto meet our obligations. The lease of qualified healthcare properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements      We lease certain qualifiedhealth care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liabilitycompanies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lesseescontract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operationsat these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lesseestructure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they arepaid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a qualified health care property witha taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligibleindependent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions arenot satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as aREIT — Income Tests” above. If certain sale-leasebacktransactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service as “trueleases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences      We have purchased certainproperties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we mayenter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any suchsale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the leasewill be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated asthe owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However,depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the Internal RevenueService might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but ismore properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leasebacktransaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the InternalRevenue Service, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions fordepreciation and cost recoverygenerally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leasebacktransaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT assettests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effectivewith the year of re-characterization. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation —Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Asset Tests” and“Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations —Qualification as a REIT — Income Tests” above. Alternatively, the amount of ourREIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meetthe REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT— Annual Distribution Requirements” above.   "
8,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2014-02-21,"Risk Factors
 This sectiondiscusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations andfinancial condition. It does not describe all risks and uncertaintiesapplicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of thefollowing risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yetidentified or that we currently think are not material, actually occur, wecould be materially adversely affected. In that event, the value of oursecurities could decline. We group theserisk factors into three categories: •         Risks arising from our business; •         Risks arising from our capital structure; and  •         Risks arising from our status as a REIT. Risks Arising from Our Business Our investments in andacquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessfulor fail to meet our expectations We are exposed tothe risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We couldencounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquiredproperties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties mightrequire significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to ourongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to anoperator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps toensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect ourresults of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that ouranticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject tovarious conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing,on anticipated terms, or at all.  We also may be unable to quickly andefficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfoliosof properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverseeffect on our results of operations and financial condition. 31  Ourinvestments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack ofexclusive control over these investments, our partners’ insolvency or failureto meet its obligations and disputes between us and our partners We have enteredinto, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventureswith other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks thatmay not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibilitythat our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributionswhen due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certainliabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner mightat any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are orbecome inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engagedin a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additionalresources to resolve such disputes and could have an adverse impact on theoperations and profitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may bein a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructionsor requests. In addition, our ability to transfer our interest in a jointventure to a third party may be restricted. In some instances, we and/or ourpartner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could causeus to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when weotherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquireour partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash,available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we maybe forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwiseprefer to retain it. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-makingauthority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control theproperties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest,certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale,acquisition or financing of a property. We are exposed to operationalrisks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that couldadversely affect our revenue and operations  We are exposed tovarious operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operatingproperties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability togenerate revenues. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, Medicare andMedicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economicconditions; competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulatedlicensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; theavailability and increases in cost of general and professional liabilityinsurance coverage; state regulation and rights of residents related toentrance fees; and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as aresult of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factorsmay adversely affect our revenue and operations. Decreases in our operators’revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ability to make payments to us Our operators’revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare andMedicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities areprimarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance andrent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and maycontinue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budgetshortfalls. Operating costs continue to increase for our operators. To theextent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expensesresult in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us, thecredit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to berelied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may needto record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to disposeof an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any suchimpairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results. The continuedweakened economy may also have an adverse effect on our operators and tenants,including their ability to access credit or maintain occupancy and/or private payrates. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operatorsare materially adversely impacted by economic conditions, our revenue andoperations may be adversely affected. Increased competition mayaffect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us   The operators ofour properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators ofproperties and other health care providers that provide comparable services. Wecannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able toachieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meetall of their obligations to us. Our operators are expected to encounterincreased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attractresidents or expand their businesses. The insolvency or bankruptcyof our obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition We are exposed tothe risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal andinterest or other payments due us, which may result in an obligor bankruptcy orinsolvency, or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvencyproceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provideus with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate 32  paymentof rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right toterminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal andunpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, thebankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filedfor bankruptcy or reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject toinsolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collectunpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interestin the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. We may be requiredto fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preservethe value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on aproperty and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, wehave terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to anothertenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans toand limited indemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition aleased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, whichmay expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events occur, our revenueand operating cash flow may be adversely affected. We may not be able to timelyreinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us From time to time,we will have cash available from (1) the proceeds of sales of our securities,(2) principal payments on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases orsimilar financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenuesand continue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest theseproceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with abroad variety of potential investors. This competition for attractiveinvestments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments onterms acceptable to us. Failure to properly manageour rapid growth could distract our management or increase ourexpenses We haveexperienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of timeand expect to continue this rapid growth in the future. This growth hasresulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management. Futureproperty acquisitions could place significant additional demands on, andrequire us to expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure tomanage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and, inparticular, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows,which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions tostockholders. Our growth could also increase our capital requirements, whichmay require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incuradditional debt. We depend on GenesisHealthCare, LLC (“Genesis”) for a significant portion of our revenues and anyinability or unwillingness by Genesis to satisfy its obligations under itsagreements with us could adversely affect us The properties welease to Genesis account for a significant portion of our revenues, and becauseour leases with Genesis are triple-net leases, we also depend on Genesis to payall insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses inconnection with the leased properties. We cannot assure you that Genesis willhave sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to makerental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under our leases,and any inability or unwillingness by Genesis to do so could have an adverseeffect on us. Genesis has also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmlessfrom and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising inconnection with its business, and we cannot assure you that Genesis will havesufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enableit to satisfy its indemnification obligations. The properties managed by SunriseSenior Living, LLC account for a significant portion of our revenues andoperating income and any adverse developments in its business or financialcondition could adversely affect us Sunrise SeniorLiving, LLC manages our entire Sunrise property portfolio, which as of December31, 2013, consisted of 125 seniors housing properties.  These propertiesaccount for a significant portion of our revenues, and we rely on SunriseSenior Living, LLC to manage these properties efficiently and effectively.  Anyadverse developments in Sunrise Senior Living, LLC’s business or financialcondition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently andeffectively, which could adversely affect us.  Ownership of property outsidethe United States may subject us to different or greater risks than thoseassociated with our domestic operations We have operationsin Canada and the United Kingdom. International development, ownership, andoperating activities involve risks that are different from those we face withrespect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but arenot limited to, any international currency gain recognized with respect tochanges in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test orthe 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify andmaintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect tothe repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political,regulatory, and economic conditions, including regionally, nationally, andlocally; challenges in managing international operations; challenges ofcomplying 33  with a wide variety of foreign laws andregulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance,operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; foreign ownershiprestrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences in lendingpractices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to providefinancing; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the United Statesthat affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. ForeignCorrupt Practices Act. If we are unable to successfully manage the risksassociated with international expansion and operations, our results ofoperations and financial condition may be adversely affected. We do not know if our tenantswill renew their existing leases, and if they do not, we may beunable to lease the properties on as favorable terms, or at all We cannot predictwhether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms,which expire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would berequired to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them. Therecan be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacementtenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us asthe current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our operators’ may not have the necessaryinsurance coverage to insure adequately against losses In recent years,skilled nursing and seniors housing operators have experienced substantialincreases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. As aresult, general and professional liability costs have increased in somemarkets. General and professional liability insurance coverage may berestricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the property operators’future operations, cashflows and financial condition, and may have a material adverse effect on theproperty operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us.   Our ownership of propertiesthrough ground leases exposes us to the loss of such propertiesupon breach or termination of the ground leases We have acquiredan interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest inthe property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additionalproperties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. Asthe lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losingthe property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of theground lease by us. The requirements of, orchanges to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid,could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financialcondition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ability to meet their obligations to us Some of ourobligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extentthat an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues fromgovernment payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may besubject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments,recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrativerulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscalintermediaries or carriers, government funding restrictions (at a program levelor with respect to specific facilities) and interruption or delays in paymentsdue to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. Inrecent years, government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health careproviders due to budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likelycontinue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. Wecannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any futurelegislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors andproperties. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels willbe available for services provided by any property operator, whether theproperty receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors.Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursementrates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity,financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect theability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us. See “Item 1 — Business —Certain Government Regulations — United States — Reimbursement” above. The PatientProtection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as modified by the Health Care andEducation Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”),provides those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligiblestate residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level withan increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014,when certain conditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States SupremeCourt upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partiallyinvalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allowsstates to elect not to participate in the expansion—and to forego funding forthe Medicaid expansion—without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Giventhat the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it isunclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as oflate January 2014, roughly half of the states have made statements or otherwiseindicated that they do not intend to expand Medicaid coverage at this time. Theparticipation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the 34  dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, throughnew patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay ourtenants. While the federal government will pay for approximately 100% of thoseadditional costs from 2014 to 2016, states will be expected to pay for part ofthose additional costs beginning in 2017. In light of this, at least one statethat has passed legislation to allow the state to expand its Medicaid coveragehas included sunset provisions in the legislation that require that theexpanded benefits be reduced or eliminated if the federal government’s fundingfor the program is decreased or eliminated, permitting the state to re-visitthe issue once it begins to share financial responsibility for the expansion.With increasingly strained budgets, it is unclear how states that do notinclude such sunset provisions will pay their share of these additionalMedicaid costs and what other health care expenditures could be reduced as aresult. A significant reduction in other health care related spending by statesto pay for increased Medicaid costs could affect our tenants’ revenue streams.See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States —Reimbursement” above and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations — Health Care Industry — HealthReform Laws” below. More generally,and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environmentfor health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficitand budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based,far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy,our business or that of our operators and tenants. Our operators’ or tenants’failure to comply with federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adverselyaffect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect ouroperators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us  Our operators andtenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, andindustry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations,and standards. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of theselaws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denialof reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusionfrom federal and state health care programs, loss of license or closure of thefacility. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ abilityto make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. See “Item 1 —Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Other Related Laws”above. Many of ourproperties may require a license, registration, and/or certificate of need (“CON”)to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of arequired license, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operatingin the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events couldmaterially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rentpayments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, includingthe addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, andthe construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON orother similar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — CertainGovernment Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above. Illiquidity of real estateinvestments could significantly impede our ability to respond toadverse changes in the performance of our properties Real estateinvestments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly sell or exchangeany of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditionswill be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full valuefor any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. Ourinability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investmentscould adversely affect ourfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed tothe risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and inparticular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in thereal estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and ourability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Unfavorable resolution ofpending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition From time to time,we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings, lawsuits andother claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arisingout of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in whichsuch operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold usharmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising inconnection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution ofpending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome,litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantlydivert the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will beable to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or futurelitigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, governmentproceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs orinterruption of our normal business operations. Development, redevelopmentand construction risks could affect our profitability 35  At any given time, we may be in the process ofconstructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON andlicense before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use. Theoperator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enterinto Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third party payorcontracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessaryCON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completionof construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenueson the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license orcertification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreementsor contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtaina license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessaryprovider agreements or contracts. In connection withour renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities,we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning,land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits andauthorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or ourabandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be able to obtainfinancing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with ourdevelopment activities, and we may not be able to complete construction andlease-up of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debtservice expense or construction costs. Additionally, thetime frame required for development, construction and lease-up of theseproperties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns.Because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if thecash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced toborrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed andacquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which couldadversely affect our overall financial performance. In decidingwhether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptionsregarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, weestimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy, rental ratesand capital costs. If our financial projections with respect to a new propertyare inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors, theproperty may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Ourestimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property mayprove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet ourprofitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties that are notfully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient topay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property. We mayexperience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters, whichcould result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, adecrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital wehave invested in a property Wemaintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage onour properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believeare appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and wecontinually review our insurance programs and requirements. However, a largenumber of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible torevenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions ornatural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods. Webelieve, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outsideconsultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate tocover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes,earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions and naturaldisasters. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurancewill not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event andthe impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significantportion of the losses. These losses may lead to an increase of our and ourtenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from anaffected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we haveinvested in an affected property.  In addition, we or our tenants may notpurchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insuranceexceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative tothe risk of loss. We may incur costs toremediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have anadverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition Under variousfederal and state laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required torespond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property andmay be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties thatresult from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. Wemay become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs inconnection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to aperson based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants orborrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property.Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that weown or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments aredesigned to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believequalifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilitiesarise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of ourproperties are subject to material environmental contamination. However,environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incurcosts to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect onour business or financial condition or the business or financial condition ofour obligors.36   Cybersecurity incidents coulddisrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information  Our business is atrisk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts togain unauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronicsecurity breaches. Such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts togain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to moresophisticated security threats. While we employ a number of measures toprevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such effortswill be successful in preventing a cyber attack. Cybersecurity incidents coulddisrupt our business and compromise the confidential information of ouremployees, operators and tenants. Our certificate ofincorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions Our certificate ofincorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions onshare ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approvalrequirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult foror even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of ourincumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit ordiscourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. Our success depends on keypersonnel whose continued service is not guaranteed We are dependenton key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with ourexecutive officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have anadverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more than one could havea material adverse impact on our business. Risks Arising from Our CapitalStructure We may become more leveraged Permanentfinancing for our investments is typically provided through a combination ofpublic offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumptionof secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us tobecome more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portionof our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable toa downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additionalfinancing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one ormore of the rating agencies. We are subject to covenantsin our debt agreements that may restrict or limit our operations andacquisitions and our failure to comply with the covenants in our debtagreements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition Our debtagreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Amongother things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratiosand minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incurindebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches ofthese covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing theapplicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaultedagainst such instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse impact onour business, results of operations and financial condition. Limitations on our ability toaccess capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make futureinvestments or to meet our obligations and commitments We cannot assureyou that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make futureinvestments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature.  Ouraccess to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little orno control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general marketconditions; the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current andpotential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of theshares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; thefinancial stability of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meettheir commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us;changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; or default ordelay in payment by the United States of its obligations. If our access tocapital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negativelyimpact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness,fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders. Also, the federalgovernment’s failure to increase the amount of debt that it is statutorilypermitted to incur as needed to meet its future financial commitments or adowngrade in the debt rating on U.S. government securities could lead to aweakened U.S. 37  dollar, rising interest rates andconstrained access to capital, which could materially adversely affect the U.S.and global economies, increase our costs of borrowing and have a materialadverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/orfinancial condition. Downgrades in our creditratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability ofcapital We plan to managethe Company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our currentprofile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain ourcurrent credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any orall of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost andavailability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact onour consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Fluctuations in the value offoreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial position As we expand ouroperations internationally, currency exchange rate fluctuations could affectour results of operations and financial position. We expect to generate anincreasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies asthe Canadian dollar and the British pound. Although we may enter into foreignexchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currencymortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value offoreign currencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuationswill not have a material adverse effect on us. Our entry into swapagreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest ratesor foreign currency exchange rates We enter into swapagreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rateand foreign currency exchange rate volatility. These swap agreements involverisks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligationsunder these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effectivein reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currencyexchange rates. When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is arisk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against which the swapis intended to hedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may beadversely affected. Risks Arising from Our Status asa REIT We might fail to qualify orremain qualified as a REIT We intend tooperate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the“Code”), and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner. Ifwe lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences thatwill substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligationsand for distribution to our stockholders because: •         we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders incomputing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax atregular corporate rates;•         we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possiblyincreased state and local taxes; and•         unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we couldnot elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following theyear during which we were disqualified. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a numberof complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, andif we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and otherincome taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we coulddistribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we would not berequired to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not requiredto pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid anexcise tax. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income TaxConsiderations” above for a discussion of the provisions of the Code that applyto us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT. In addition, ifwe fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would continueto be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulatedearnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for thedividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible fortaxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains(currently at a maximum rate of 20%) with respect to distributions. As a result ofall these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair ourability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the valueof our common stock. 38  Qualification as a REIT involves the application ofhighly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limitedjudicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of variousfactual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affectour ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualifyas a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remainqualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations” above. The 90% annual distributionrequirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage inotherwise beneficial transactions To comply with the90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductibleexcise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as aREIT — Annual Distribution Requirements” above. Although we anticipate that wegenerally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfythe REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, wemay not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%distribution requirement, or we may decide to retain cash or distribute suchgreater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. Thismay be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income andactual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion ofthat income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income,on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principalamortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cashdeductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets toenable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timingdifferences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrowfunds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you thatwe will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distributeother property or securities or engage in another transaction intended toenable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us toraise additional capital to meet our obligations. The lease of qualified healthcare properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements We lease certainqualified health care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limitedliability companies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), whichlessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health careoperations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiarylessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) theyare paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a qualified health care propertywith a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligibleindependent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions arenot satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as aREIT — Income Tests” above. If certain sale-leasebacktransactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service as “trueleases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences We have purchasedcertain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, andwe may enter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any suchsale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the leasewill be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated asthe owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However,depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the Internal RevenueService might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” butis more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leasebacktransaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the InternalRevenue Service, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions fordepreciation and cost recoverygenerally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leasebacktransaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT assettests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effectivewith the year of re-characterization. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation —Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Asset Tests” and“Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations —Qualification as a REIT — Income Tests” above. Alternatively, the amount of ourREIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meetthe REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. See “Item 1 —Business — Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as aREIT — Annual Distribution Requirements” above.   "

 This section discusses the most significant factorsthat affect our business, operations and financial condition. It does notdescribe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry orownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, as well as otherrisks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently thinkare not material, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. Inthat event, the value of our securities could decline. This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documentsincorporated by reference contain statements that constitute “forward-lookingstatements” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws. Theseforward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding: •     the possible expansionof our portfolio, including our ability to close our anticipated acquisitionsand investments on currently anticipated terms, or within currently anticipatedtimeframes, or at all;  •     the sale ofproperties;  •     the performance of ouroperators/tenants and properties;  •     our ability to enterinto agreements with new viable tenants for vacant space or for properties thatwe take back from financially troubled tenants, if any; •     our occupancy rates;  •     our ability toacquire, develop and/or manage properties; •     our ability to makedistributions to stockholders;  27    •     ourpolicies and plans regarding investments, financings and other matters; •     our ability tosuccessfully manage the risks associated with international expansion andoperations;  •     our tax status as areal estate investment trust;  •     our criticalaccounting policies;  •     our ability toappropriately balance the use of debt and equity; •     our ability to accesscapital markets or other sources of funds; and •     our ability to meetour earnings guidance.  When we use words such as “may,” “will,” “intend,”“should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate” or similarexpressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Forward-lookingstatements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks anduncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results maydiffer materially from our expectations. This may be a result of various factors,including, but not limited to: •     the status of theeconomy;  •     the status of capitalmarkets, including availability and cost of capital; •     issues facing thehealth care industry, including compliance with, and changes to, regulationsand payment policies, responding to government investigations and punitivesettlements and operators’/tenants’ difficulty in cost-effectively obtainingand maintaining adequate liability and other insurance; •     changes in financingterms;  •     competition within thehealth care, seniors housing and life science industries; •     negative developmentsin the operating results or financial condition of operators/tenants,including, but not limited to, their ability to pay rent and repay loans; •     our ability totransition or sell facilities with profitable results; •     the failure to makenew investments as and when anticipated; •     acts of God affectingour properties;  •     our ability tore-lease space at similar rates as vacancies occur; •     our ability to timelyreinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to assets sold; •     operator/tenant orjoint venture partner bankruptcies or insolvencies; •     the cooperation ofjoint venture partners; •     government regulationsaffecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates and operationalrequirements; •     regulatory approvaland market acceptance of the products and technologies of life science tenants; •     liability or contractclaims by or against operators/tenants; •     unanticipateddifficulties and/or expenditures relating to future acquisitions; •     environmental lawsaffecting our properties;  28    •     changesin rules or practices governing our financial reporting; •     the movement of U.S.and foreign currency exchange rates; •     qualification as a REIT; •     key managementpersonnel recruitment and retention; and •     the risks describedbelow:  Risk factors relatedto our operators’ revenues and expenses Our operators’ revenues are primarily driven byoccupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, ifapplicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs oflabor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenuesfrom government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressuredue to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating costs continueto increase for our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenuesand/or any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generatingenough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator and the value ofother collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of suchproperty is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset.Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, suchsale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negativelyaffect our financial results. The continued weakened economy may have an adverseeffect on our operators and tenants, including their ability to access creditor maintain occupancy and/or private pay rates. If the operations, cash flowsor financial condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted byeconomic conditions, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected. Increased competition may affect our operators’ abilityto meet their obligations to us  The operators of our properties compete on a local andregional basis with operators of properties and other health care providersthat provide comparable services. We cannot be certain that the operators ofall of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and ratelevels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Ouroperators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future thatcould limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses. Risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may notbe able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that an obligormight become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons.Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict atenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and ourloans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demandimmediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on thecollateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency lawsafford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy orreorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedingsmay be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case ofa lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, andto exercise other rights and remedies. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g.,real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investmentproperty, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition aproperty to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease witha tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations,we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of thenew obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we maytake possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successorliabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow maybe adversely affected. Transfers of health care facilities may requireregulatory approvals and these facilitiesmay not have efficient alternative uses Transfers of health care facilities to successoroperators frequently are subject to regulatory approvals or notifications,including, but not limited to, change of ownership approvals under certificateof need (“CON”) or determination of need laws, state licensure laws andMedicare and Medicaid provider arrangements, that are not required fortransfers of other types of real estate. The replacement of a health carefacility operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal,state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or thereplacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. Alternatively,given the specialized nature of our facilities, we may be required to spendsubstantial time and funds to adapt these properties to other uses. If we areunable 29    to timely transfer properties to successoroperators or find efficient alternative uses, our revenue and operations may beadversely affected. Risk factors related to government regulations Some of our obligors’ businesses are affected bygovernment reimbursement. To the extent that an operator/tenant receives asignificant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily Medicareand Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs,court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment orother delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, government fundingrestrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities) andinterruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigationsand audits at such property. In recent years, government payors have frozen orreduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures. Healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance tofederal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimatetiming or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financialcondition of our obligors and properties. There can be no assurance thatadequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by anyproperty operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare,Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of servicesreimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverseeffect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition and results ofoperations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet itsobligations to us. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain GovernmentRegulations — Reimbursement” above. Our operators and tenants generally are subject tovarying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards.  Our operators’or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standardscould result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition offines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such actions mayhave an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments tous and, therefore, adversely impact us. See “Item 1 — Business —Certain Government Regulations — Other Related Laws” above. Many of our properties may require a license,registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration,or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent afacility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants.These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ability to make rent payments to us.  State and local laws also may regulatethe expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition ofmedical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health carefacilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval from a state agency.See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations —Licensing and Certification” above. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of2010, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010(collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), provides states with an increasedfederal medical assistance percentage under certain conditions. On June 28,2012, The United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of theHealth Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. Theruling on Medicaid expansion will allow states not to participate in theexpansion—and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion—without losing theirexisting Medicaid funding. Given that the federal government substantiallyfunds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear whether any state will pursue thisoption, although at least some appear to be considering this option at thistime. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dualeffect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but furtherstraining state budgets. While the federal government will pay forapproximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states will beexpected to begin paying for part of those additional costs in 2017. Withincreasingly strained budgets, it is unclear how states will pay their share ofthese additional Medicaid costs and what other health care expenditures couldbe reduced as a result. A significant reduction in other health care relatedspending by states to pay for increased Medicaid costs could affect ourtenants’ revenue streams. See “Item 1 — Business — CertainGovernment Regulations — Reimbursement” above and “Item 7—Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—HealthCare Industry—Health Reform Laws” below. More generally, and because of the dynamic nature ofthe legislative and regulatory environment for health care products andservices, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, wecannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative orregulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business or that of ourtenants. Risk factors related to liability claims and insurancecosts In recent years, skilled nursing and seniors housingoperators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size ofpatient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liabilitycosts have increased in some markets. General and professional liabilityinsurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affectthe property operators’ future 30    operations, cash flowsand financial condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the propertyoperators’ ability to meet their obligations to us. Unfavorable resolution of pending and futurelitigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial condition.  From time to time, we may be directly involved in anumber of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We may also be named asdefendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions ofour operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managershave agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against variousclaims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respectivebusinesses. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may havea material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantialcosts and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. Therecan be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorablesettlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation orfuture litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could leadto increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. Risk factors related to acquisitions We are exposed to the risk that some of ouracquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipateddifficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, includingcontingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significantmanagement attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business.If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and theproject is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of theproject. Such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations.  Furthermore,there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments,the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummatedin accordance with anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all. Risk factors related to joint ventures We have entered into, and may continue in the futureto enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities.Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with othermethods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might becomeinsolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail tomeet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us forguarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time haveeconomic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistentwith our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with ourpartner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve suchdisputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitabilityof the joint venture; and that our partner may be in a position to take actionor withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests. In addition, ourability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may berestricted. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right totrigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, oracquire our partner’s interest, at a time when we otherwise would not haveinitiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest maybe limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity orother capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interestin the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. Jointventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners,which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures.Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may requirepartner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property. Risk factors related to our seniors housing operatingproperties  We are exposed to various operational risks withrespect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costsor adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.  These risks includefluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable,and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local,and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws,regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of generaland professional liability insurance coverage; state regulation and rights ofresidents related to entrance fees; the availability and increases in the costof labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise).  Any one or a combinationof these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations. Risk factors related to life science facilities Our tenants in the life science industry face highlevels of regulation, expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect theirability to make payments to us. Research, development and clinical testing ofproducts and technologies can be very expensive and sources of funds may not beavailable to our life science tenants in the future. The products and technologiesthat are developed and 31    manufactured by our lifescience tenants may require regulatory approval prior to being made, marketed,sold and used. The regulatory process can be costly, long and unpredictable.Even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance, theproduct still presents regulatory and liability risks, such as safety concerns,competition from new products and eventually the expiration of patentprotection. These factors may affect the ability of our life science tenants tomake timely payments to us, which may adversely affect our revenue andoperations. Risk factors related to indebtedness Permanent financing for our investments is typicallyprovided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securitiesand the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumptionof indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could(1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to thepayment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in theeconomy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, or(4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of therating agencies. Our debt agreements contain various covenants,restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisionsrequire us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth andimpose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens andmake investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result indefaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, inaddition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments.These defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition. In addition, adverse economic conditions may impactthe availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we areable to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable. In those circumstances,we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets. Ouraccess to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little orno control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general marketconditions and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our currentand potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price ofthe shares of our capital stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able toraise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet ourobligations and commitments as they mature. Risk factors related to our credit ratings We plan to manage the Company to maintain a capitalstructure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurancethat we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades interms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have amaterial adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could inturn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,liquidity and/or financial condition. Risk factors related to swaps We enter into interest rate swap agreements from timeto time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currencyexchange rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the riskthat counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under thesearrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducingour exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a risk that we willnot complete the long-term borrowing against which the swap is intended tohedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adverselyaffected. Risk factors related to environmental laws Under various federal and state laws, owners oroperators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or releaseof hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for propertydamage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmentalcontamination or exposure to hazardous substances. We may become liable toreimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with thecontamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on theperson’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarilyresponsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we reviewenvironmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber priorto taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “allappropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocentpurchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments,we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to materialenvironmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be presentin our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, whichcould have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition orthe business or financial condition of our obligors. Risk factors related to facilities that requireentrance fees 32    Certain of our seniors housing facilities require thepayment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may berefundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are subject to substantialoversight by state regulators relating to these funds. As a result of thisoversight, residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights,including, for example, the right to cancel their contracts within a specifiedperiod of time and certain lien rights. The oversight and rights of residentswithin these facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of theoperators of such facilities and therefore may negatively impact us. Risk factors related to facilities under constructionor development At any given time, we may be in the process ofconstructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON andlicense before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use. Theoperator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enterinto Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third party payorcontracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessaryCON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after thecompletion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earnany revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains alicense or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provideragreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that isable to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and thenecessary provider agreements or contracts. In connection with our renovation, redevelopment,development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, orsuffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy andother required governmental permits and authorizations. These factors couldresult in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, wemay not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render usunable to proceed with our development activities, and we may not be able tocomplete construction and lease-up of a property on schedule, which couldresult in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development,construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to waityears for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cashdistributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations orrefinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money tofund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may notproduce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overallfinancial performance. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particularproperty, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of thatproperty. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based onexpected occupancy, rental rates and capital costs. If our financialprojections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result ofincreases in capital costs or other factors, the property may fail to performas we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs ofrepositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate,which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. Additionally,we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased, and the cash flow fromexisting operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debtservice associated with that property. We do not know if our tenants will renew theirexisting leases, and if they do not,we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms, or at all We cannot predict whether our tenants will renewexisting leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times.If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants tooccupy those properties or sell them. There can be no assurance that we wouldbe able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with newtenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would beable to lease those properties at all. Our ownership of properties through ground leasesexposes us to the loss of such propertiesupon breach or termination of the ground leases We have acquired an interest in certain of ourproperties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which thebuilding is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the futurethrough the purchase of interests in ground leases. As the lessee under aground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upontermination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us. Illiquidity of real estate investments couldsignificantly impede our ability torespond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Ourability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changesin economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be giventhat we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sellfor liquidity reasons. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in theperformance of our investments could 33    adversely affectour financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposedto the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and inparticular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in thereal estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and ourability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds From time to time, we will have cash available from(1) the proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal paymentson our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties, includingnon-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similarfinancial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues andcontinue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest these proceedsin a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad varietyof potential investors. This competition for attractive investments maynegatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable tous. Failure to properly manage our rapid growth coulddistract our management or increaseour expenses We have experienced rapid growth and development in arelatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in thefuture. This growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for ourmanagement. Future property acquisitions could place significant additionaldemands on, and require us to expand, our management, resources and personnel.Our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our businessand, in particular, our financial condition, results of operations and cashflows, which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions tostockholders. Our growth could also increase our capital requirements, whichmay require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incuradditional debt. Ownership of property outside the United States may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with ourdomestic operations We have operations in Canada and the United Kingdom.  Internationaldevelopment, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that aredifferent from those we face with respect to our domestic properties andoperations.  These risks include, but are not limited to, any internationalcurrency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may notqualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that wemust satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT;challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash;changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions, includingregionally, nationally, and locally; challenges in managing internationaloperations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws andregulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance,operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; foreignownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries; differences inlending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to providefinancing; regional or country-specific business cycles and economicinstability; and changes in applicable laws and regulations in the UnitedStates that affect foreign operations.  If we are unable to successfully managethe risks associated with international expansion and operations, our resultsof operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Risk factors related to changes in currency exchangerates As we expand our operations internationally, currencyexchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financialposition.  We expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue andexpenses in such foreign currencies as the Canadian dollar and the Britishpound.  Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financialinstitutions and/or obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce ourexposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, we cannot assure you that foreign currencyfluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us. We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT We intend to operate as a REIT under the InternalRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believe we have and willcontinue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we willface serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the fundsavailable for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to ourstockholders because: •     we would not beallowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxableincome and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporaterates; •     we could be subject tothe federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and localtaxes; and •     unless we are entitledto relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to taxas a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we weredisqualified.34     Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a numberof complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, andif we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and otherincome taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we coulddistribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we would not berequired to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not requiredto pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid anexcise tax. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — FederalIncome Tax Considerations” for a discussion of the provisions of the Code thatapply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, alldistributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to theextent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporatestockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, andindividual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generallyapplicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 20%) withrespect to distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure toqualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our businessstrategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application ofhighly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limitedjudicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of variousfactual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affectour ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualifyas a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remainqualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See“Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income TaxConsiderations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The 90% annual distribution requirement will decreaseour liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficialtransactions To comply with the 90% distribution requirementapplicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must makedistributions to our stockholders. See “Item 1 — Business— Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualificationas a REIT — Annual Distribution Requirements” included in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K. Although we anticipate that we generally will havesufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distributionrequirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficientcash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we maydecide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary toavoid income and excise taxation. This may be due to timing differences betweenthe actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on theone hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses inarriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductibleexpenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expendituresin excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cashor liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. Inthe event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retaincash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although wecannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends,if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in anothertransaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements.This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. The lease of qualified health care properties to a taxableREIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements We lease certain qualified health care properties totaxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of which the taxableREIT subsidiaries are members), which lessees contract with managers (orrelated parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties.  Therents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated asqualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to anarms-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable REITsubsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor(as defined in the Code).  If any of these conditions are not satisfied, thenthe rents will not be qualifying rents.  See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation —Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Income Tests.” If certain sale-leaseback transactions are notcharacterized by the Internal Revenue Service as “true leases,” we may besubject to adverse tax consequences We have purchased certain properties and leased themback to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactionsin the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to bestructured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “truelease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S.federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specifictransaction, the Internal Revenue Service might take the position that thetransaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some othermanner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged andsuccessfully re-characterized by the Internal Revenue Service, we would not beentitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and 35    cost recovery generallyavailable to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transactionwere so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests orincome tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with theyear of re-characterization.  See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — FederalIncome Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Asset Tests” and “—Income Tests.” Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could berecalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distributionrequirements for a taxable year.  See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — FederalIncome Tax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Annual DistributionRequirements.” Other risk factors We are also subject to other risks. First, our certificateof incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions onshare ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approvalrequirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult foror even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of ourincumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit ordiscourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. Additionally, we are dependent on key personnel.Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executiveofficers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an adverseimpact on our operations. We believe that losing more than one could have amaterial adverse impact on our business. "

 25   This section discusses the most significant factorsthat affect our business, operations and financial condition. It does notdescribe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownershipof our securities. If any of the following risks, as well as other risks anduncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are notmaterial, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In thatevent, the value of our securities could decline. This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documentsincorporated by reference contain statements that constitute “forward-lookingstatements” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws. Theseforward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those regarding: •     the possible expansionof our portfolio;  •     the sale ofproperties;  •     the performance of ouroperators/tenants and properties;  •     our ability to enterinto agreements with new viable tenants for vacant space or for properties thatwe take back from financially troubled tenants, if any; •     our occupancy rates;  •     our ability toacquire, develop and/or manage properties; •     our ability to makedistributions to stockholders;  •     our policies and plansregarding investments, financings and other matters; •     our ability tosuccessfully manage the risks associated with international expansion andoperations;  •     our tax status as areal estate investment trust;  •     our criticalaccounting policies;  •     our ability toappropriately balance the use of debt and equity; •     our ability to accesscapital markets or other sources of funds; and •     our ability to meetour earnings guidance.  When we use words such as “may,” “will,” “intend,”“should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate” or similarexpressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Forward-lookingstatements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks anduncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results maydiffer materially from our expectations. This may be a result of variousfactors, including, but not limited to: •     the status of theeconomy;  •     the status of capitalmarkets, including availability and cost of capital; •     issues facing thehealth care industry, including compliance with, and changes to, regulationsand payment policies, responding to government investigations and punitivesettlements and operators’/tenants’ difficulty in cost-effectively obtainingand maintaining adequate liability and other insurance; •     changes in financingterms;  •     competition within thehealth care, seniors housing and life science industries; •     negative developmentsin the operating results or financial condition of operators/tenants, including,but not limited to, their ability to pay rent and repay loans; •     our ability totransition or sell facilities with profitable results; 26   •     thefailure to make new investments as and when anticipated; •     acts of God affectingour properties;  •     our ability tore-lease space at similar rates as vacancies occur; •     our ability to timelyreinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to assets sold; •     operator/tenant orjoint venture partner bankruptcies or insolvencies; •     the cooperation ofjoint venture partners; •     government regulationsaffecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates and operationalrequirements; •     regulatory approvaland market acceptance of the products and technologies of life science tenants; •     liability or contractclaims by or against operators/tenants; •     unanticipateddifficulties and/or expenditures relating to future acquisitions; •     environmental lawsaffecting our properties;  •     changes in rules orpractices governing our financial reporting; •     the movement of U.S. andCanadian exchange rates; •     other legal andoperational matters, including REIT qualification and key management personnelrecruitment and retention; and •     the risks describedbelow:  Risk factors relatedto our operators’ revenues and expenses Our operators’ revenues are primarily driven byoccupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private payrates. Expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs oflabor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenuesfrom government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressuredue to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating costs continueto increase for our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenuesand/or any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generatingenough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator and the value ofother collateral would have to be relied upon. The continued weakened economy may have an adverseeffect on our operators and tenants, including their ability to access creditor maintain occupancy rates. If the operations, cash flows or financialcondition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by economicconditions, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected. Increased competition may affect our operators’ability to meet their obligations tous  The operators of our properties compete on a local andregional basis with operators of properties and other health care providersthat provide comparable services. We cannot be certain that the operators ofall of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and ratelevels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Ouroperators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future thatcould limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses. Risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may notbe able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that an obligormight become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons.Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict atenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and ourloans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demandimmediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on thecollateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency lawsafford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy orreorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency 27   proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability tocollect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal andinterest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g.,real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investmentproperty, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition aproperty to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease witha tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations,we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of thenew obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we maytake possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successorliabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow maybe adversely affected. Transfers of health care facilities may requireregulatory approvals and these facilitiesmay not have efficient alternative uses Transfers of health care facilities to successoroperators frequently are subject to regulatory approvals or notifications,including, but not limited to, change of ownership approvals under certificateof need (“CON”) or determination of need laws, state licensure laws andMedicare and Medicaid provider arrangements, that are not required fortransfers of other types of real estate. The replacement of a health carefacility operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal,state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacementof the operator licensed to manage the facility. Alternatively, given thespecialized nature of our facilities, we may be required to spend substantialtime and funds to adapt these properties to other uses. If we are unable totimely transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient alternativeuses, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected. Risk factors related to government regulations Our obligors’ businesses are affected by governmentreimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that an operator/tenantreceives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors,primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory andregulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of programoverpayments or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, governmentfunding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specificfacilities) and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoinggovernment investigations and audits at such property. In recent years,government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers dueto budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be ofparamount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make anyassessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reformsmay have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There canbe no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available forservices provided by any property operator, whether the property receivesreimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits onthe scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could havea material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition andresults of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligorto meet its obligations to us. See “Item 1 — Business — CertainGovernment Regulations — Reimbursement” above. Our operators and tenants generally are subject toextensive federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards.  Our operators’or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standardscould result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition offines, suspension or decertification from federal and state health careprograms, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such actions may have aneffect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and,therefore, adversely impact us. See “Item 1 — Business — CertainGovernment Regulations — Other Related Laws” above. Many of our properties may require a license,registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration,or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent afacility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants.These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ability to make rent payments to us.  State and local laws also may regulatethe expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition ofmedical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health carefacilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval from a state agency.See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations —Licensing and Certification” above. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009(“ARRA”), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, provided$87 billion in additional federal Medicaid funding for states’ Medicaidexpenditures between October 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010.  OnAugust 10, 2010, the President signed into law H.R. 1586, which mandated asix-month extension of the increase in federal Medicaid funding for statesthrough June 30, 2011, although the enhanced federal Medicaid funding wasscaled back for the first two quarters of 2011. Under both the ARRA and H.R.1586, states meeting certain eligibility requirements temporarily receivedadditional money in the form of an increase in the federal medical assistancepercentage (“FMAP”). Thus, for a limited period of time, the share of Medicaidcosts that were paid for by the federal government went up, and each state’sshare went down.  No similar extension of increased matching has been offeredsince June 30, 2011, and states’ FMAP rates have returned to levels comparableto pre-ARRA rates. We cannot predict whether states are, or will remain,eligible to receive the additional federal Medicaid funding, or whether the 28   states will have sufficient funds for their Medicaidprograms. We also cannot predict the impact that such broad-based, far-reachinglegislation will have on the U.S. economy or our business. Risk factors related to liability claims and insurancecosts In recent years, skilled nursing and seniors housingoperators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size ofpatient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liabilitycosts have increased in some markets. General and professional liabilityinsurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affectthe property operators’ future operations, cash flows and financial condition,and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability tomeet their obligations to us. Risk factors related to acquisitions We are exposed to the risk that some of ouracquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipateddifficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, includingcontingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significantmanagement attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business.If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and theproject is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of theproject. Moreover, if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt, orboth, to finance future acquisitions, it may reduce our per share financialresults. These costs may negatively affect our results of operations. Unfavorable resolution of pending and futurelitigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial condition.  From time to time, we may be directly involved in anumber of legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We may also be named asdefendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions ofour operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managershave agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against variousclaims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respectivebusinesses. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may havea material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantialcosts and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. Therecan be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorablesettlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation orfuture litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could leadto increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. Risk factors related to joint ventures We have entered into, and may continue in the futureto enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities.Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with othermethods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might becomeinsolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail tomeet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us forguarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time haveeconomic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistentwith our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with ourpartner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve suchdisputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitabilityof the joint venture; and that our partner may be in a position to take action orwithhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests. In addition, ourability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may berestricted. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right totrigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, oracquire our partner’s interest, at a time when we otherwise would not haveinitiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest maybe limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity orother capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interestin the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. Jointventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners, whichcould limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures. Evenwhen we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may requirepartner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property. Risk factors related to our seniors housing operatingproperties  We are exposed to various operational risks withrespect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costsor adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.  These risks includefluctuations in occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable,and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local,and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws,regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of generaland professional liability insurance coverage; state regulation and rights ofresidents related to entrance fees; the availability and increases in cost oflabor (as a result of unionization or otherwise).  Any one or a combination ofthese factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations. 29   Risk factors relatedto life science facilities Our tenants in the life science industry face highlevels of regulation, expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect theirability to make payments to us. Research, development and clinical testing ofproducts and technologies can be very expensive and sources of funds may not beavailable to our life sciences tenants in the future. The products andtechnologies that are developed and manufactured by our life science tenantsmay require regulatory approval prior to being made, marketed, sold and used.The regulatory process can be costly, long and unpredictable. Even after atenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance, the product stillpresents regulatory and liability risks, such as safety concerns, competitionfrom new products and eventually the expiration of patent protection. Thesefactors may affect the ability of our life sciences tenants to make timelypayments to us, which may adversely affect our revenue and operations. Risk factors related to indebtedness Permanent financing for our investments is typicallyprovided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt andequity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. Theincurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged,which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flowto the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturnin the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, or(4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of therating agencies. Our debt agreements contain various covenants,restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisionsrequire us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth andimpose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens andmake investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result indefaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, inaddition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments.These defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition. Risk factors related to our credit ratings We plan to manage the Company to maintain a capitalstructure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurancethat we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades interms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have amaterial adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could inturn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations,liquidity and/or financial condition. Risk factors related to interest rate swaps We enter into interest rate swap agreements from timeto time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. These swapagreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail tohonor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, thesearrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes ininterest rates. When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is arisk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against which the swapis intended to hedge. If such events occur, our results of operations may beadversely affected. Risk factors related to environmental laws Under various federal and state laws, owners oroperators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or releaseof hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for propertydamage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contaminationor exposure to hazardous substances. We may become liable to reimburse thegovernment for damages and costs it incurs in connection with thecontamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on theperson’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarilyresponsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we reviewenvironmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber priorto taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “allappropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocentpurchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon suchassessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject tomaterial environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may bepresent in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination,which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financialcondition or the business or financial condition of our obligors. Risk factors related to facilities that requireentrance fees Certain of our seniors housing facilities require thepayment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may berefundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are subject to substantialoversight by state regulators relating to these funds. As a result of thisoversight, residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights,including, for example, the right to cancel their 30   contractswithin a specified period of time and certain lien rights. The oversight andrights of residents within these facilities may have an effect on the revenueor operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may negativelyimpact us. Risk factors related to facilities under constructionor development At any given time, we may be in the process ofconstructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON andlicense before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use. Theoperator also may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enterinto Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third party payorcontracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessaryCON, licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after thecompletion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earnany revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains alicense or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provideragreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that isable to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and thenecessary provider agreements or contracts. In connection with our renovation, redevelopment,development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, orsuffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy andother required governmental permits and authorizations. These factors couldresult in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, wemay not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render usunable to proceed with our development activities, and we may not be able tocomplete construction and lease-up of a property on schedule, which couldresult in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development,construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to waityears for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cashdistributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations orrefinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money tofund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may notproduce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overallfinancial performance. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particularproperty, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of thatproperty. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based onexpected occupancy and rental rates. If our financial projections with respectto a new property are inaccurate, and the property is unable to achieve theexpected occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we expected inanalyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning orredeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may resultin our failure to meet our profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquirenew properties that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existingoperations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt serviceassociated with that property. We do not know if our tenants will renew theirexisting leases, and if they do not,we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms, or at all We cannot predict whether our tenants will renewexisting leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times.If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants tooccupy those properties or sell them. There can be no assurance that we wouldbe able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with newtenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would beable to lease those properties at all. Our ownership of properties through ground leasesexposes us to the loss of such propertiesupon breach or termination of the ground leases We have acquired an interest in certain of ourproperties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which thebuilding is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the futurethrough the purchase of interests in ground leases. As the lessee under aground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upontermination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us. Illiquidity of real estate investments couldsignificantly impede our ability torespond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Ourability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response tochanges in economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can begiven that we will recognize full value for any property that we are requiredto sell for liquidity reasons. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes inthe performance of our investments could adversely affect our financialcondition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risksinherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, theseniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estateindustry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability tosell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds31    From time to time, we will have cash available from(1) the proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal paymentson our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties, includingnon-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similarfinancial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues andcontinue generating attractive returns, we expect to re-invest these proceedsin a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad varietyof potential investors. This competition for attractive investments maynegatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable tous. Failure to properly manage our rapid growth coulddistract our management or increaseour expenses We have experienced rapid growth and development in arelatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in thefuture. This growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for ourmanagement. Future property acquisitions could place significant additionaldemands on, and require us to expand, our management, resources and personnel.Our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our businessand, in particular, our financial condition, results of operations and cashflows, which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions tostockholders. Our growth could also increase our capital requirements, whichmay require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incuradditional debt. Ownership of property outside the United States may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domesticoperations International development, ownership, and operatingactivities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect toour domestic properties and operations.  These risks include, but are notlimited to, any international currency gain recognized with respect to changesin exchange rates may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95%gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify andmaintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect to therepatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political,regulatory, and economic conditions, including regionally, nationally, andlocally; challenges in managing international operations; challenges ofcomplying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including thoserelating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employmentand legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions withrespect to operations in countries; differences in lending practices and thewillingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; regional orcountry-specific business cycles and economic instability; and changes inapplicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreignoperations.  If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated withinternational expansion and operations, our results of operations and financialcondition may be adversely affected. Risk factors related to changes in currency exchangerates As we expand our operations internationally, currencyexchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financialposition.  We expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue andexpenses in such foreign currencies as the Canadian dollar.  Although we mayenter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions and/orobtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure tofluctuations in the value of foreigncurrencies,we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have amaterial adverse effect on us. We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT We intend to operate as a REIT under the InternalRevenue Code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner.If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequencesthat will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying ourobligations and for distribution to our stockholders because: •     we would not beallowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxableincome and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporaterates; •     we could be subject tothe federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and localtaxes; and •     unless we are entitledto relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to taxas a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we weredisqualified. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a numberof complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and ifwe do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and otherincome taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we coulddistribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we would not berequired to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not requiredto pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid anexcise tax. See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — FederalIncome Tax Considerations” for a discussion of the provisions of the InternalRevenue Code that apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT. 32   In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, alldistributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to theextent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporatestockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, andindividual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generallyapplicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%) withrespect to distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure toqualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our businessstrategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application ofhighly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which thereare only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determinationof various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our controlmay affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe thatwe qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify orremain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See“Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income TaxConsiderations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The 90% annual distribution requirement will decreaseour liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficialtransactions To comply with the 90% distribution requirementapplicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must makedistributions to our stockholders. See “Item 1 — Business— Taxation — Federal Income Tax Considerations — Qualificationas a REIT — Annual Distribution Requirements” included in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K. Although we anticipate that we generally will havesufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distributionrequirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficientcash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we maydecide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary toavoid income and excise taxation. This may be due to timing differences betweenthe actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on theone hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses inarriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductibleexpenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expendituresin excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cashor liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. Inthe event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retaincash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although wecannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends,if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in anothertransaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements.This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. The amount of additional indebtedness we may incur islimited by the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indenturesgoverning our senior unsecured notes. In addition, adverse economic conditionsmay impact the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms onwhich we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable. In thosecircumstances, we may be required to raise additional equity in the capitalmarkets. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which wehave little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and othergeneral market conditions and the market’s perception of our growth potentialand our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and themarket price of the shares of our capital stock. We cannot assure you that wewill be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or tomeet our obligations and commitments as they mature. The lease of qualified health care properties to a taxableREIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements We lease certain qualified health care properties weacquire to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of whichthe taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lessees contract with managers(or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated asqualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to anarms-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable REITsubsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independentcontractor.  If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents willnot be qualifying rents.  See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal IncomeTax Considerations — Qualification as a REIT — Income Tests.” If certain sale-leaseback transactions are notcharacterized by the Internal Revenue Service as “true leases,” we may besubject to adverse tax consequences We have purchased certain properties and leased themback to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter similar transactionsin the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to bestructured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “truelease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S.federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specifictransaction, the Internal Revenue Service might take the position that thetransaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some othermanner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged andsuccessfully re-characterized by the Internal Revenue Service, we would not beentitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generallyavailable to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transactionwere so re-characterized, we 33   might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or incometests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year ofre-characterization.  See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income TaxConsiderations — Qualification as a REIT — Asset Tests” and “— Income Tests.”Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated,which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution requirementsfor a taxable year.  See “Item 1 — Business — Taxation — Federal Income TaxConsiderations — Qualification as a REIT — Annual Distribution Requirements.” Other risk factors We are also subject to other risks. First, our certificateof incorporation and by-laws contain anti-takeover provisions (restrictions onshare ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approvalrequirements for business combinations) that could make it more difficult foror even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of ourincumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit ordiscourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock. Additionally, we are dependent on key personnel.Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executiveofficers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an adverseimpact on our operations. We believe that losing more than one could have amaterial adverse impact on our business. "
9,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2011-02-25,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Forward-Looking    Statements and Risk Factors
     This section discusses the most significant factors that affect    our business, operations and financial condition. It does not    describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our    industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following    risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet    identified or that we currently think are not material, actually    occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In that event,    the value of our securities could decline.     This Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements    that constitute forward-looking statements as that    term is defined in the federal securities laws. These    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,    those regarding:           the possible expansion of our portfolio;           the sale of properties;           the performance of our operators/tenants and properties;           our ability to enter into agreements with new viable tenants for    vacant space or for properties that we take back from    financially troubled tenants, if any;           our occupancy rates;           our ability to acquire, develop    and/or    manage properties;           our ability to make distributions to stockholders;           our policies and plans regarding investments, financings and    other matters;           our tax status as a real estate investment trust;           our critical accounting policies;           our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;           our ability to access capital markets or other sources of    funds; and           our ability to meet our earnings guidance.     When we use words such as may, will,    intend, should, believe,    expect, anticipate, project,    estimate or similar expressions, we are making    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not    guarantees of future performance and involve risks and    uncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and    29Table of Contents    actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This    may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited    to:           the status of the economy;           the status of capital markets, including availability and cost    of capital;           issues facing the health care industry, including compliance    with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies,    responding to government investigations and punitive settlements    and operators/tenants difficulty in cost-effectively    obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;           changes in financing terms;           competition within the health care, senior housing and life    science industries;           negative developments in the operating results or financial    condition of operators/tenants, including, but not limited to,    their ability to pay rent and repay loans;           our ability to transition or sell facilities with profitable    results;           the failure to make new investments as and when anticipated;           acts of God affecting our properties;           our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies    occur;           our ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to    assets sold;           operator/tenant or joint venture partner bankruptcies or    insolvencies;           the cooperation of joint venture partners;           government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid    reimbursement rates and operational requirements;           regulatory approval and market acceptance of the products and    technologies of life science tenants;           liability or contract claims by or against operators/tenants;           unanticipated difficulties    and/or    expenditures relating to future acquisitions;           environmental laws affecting our properties;           changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;           other legal and operational matters, including REIT    qualification and key management personnel recruitment and    retention; and           the risks described below: Risk    factors related to our operators revenues and    expenses     Our investment property operators revenues are primarily    driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if    applicable, and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities    are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities,    taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from    government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under    pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.    Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for    our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues    and/or any    increase in operating expenses result in a property not    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be    relied upon.     The recent credit and liquidity crisis, and the weakened    economy, may have a lingering adverse effect on our operators    and tenants, including their ability to access credit or    maintain occupancy rates. If the operations, cash flows or    financial condition of our operators are materially adversely    impacted by economic conditions, our revenue and operations may    be adversely affected.    30Table of ContentsIncreased    competition may affect our operators ability to meet their    obligations to us     The operators of our properties compete on a local and regional    basis with operators of properties and other health care    providers that provide comparable services. We cannot be certain    that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to    achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable    them to meet all of their obligations to us. Our operators are    expected to encounter increased competition in the future that    could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their    businesses. Risk    factors related to obligor bankruptcies     We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,    which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that    an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency    proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease    agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand    immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our    loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding    obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid    interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other    remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain    rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or    reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to    insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability    to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive    unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to    exercise other rights and remedies.     We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment    property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property    and/or    transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we    have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property    to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided    working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new    obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new    tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may    expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events    occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely    affected. Transfers    of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and    these facilities may not have efficient alternative    uses     Transfers of health care facilities to successor operators    frequently are subject to regulatory approvals or notifications,    including, but not limited to, change of ownership approvals    under certificate of need (CON) laws, state    licensure laws and Medicare and Medicaid provider arrangements,    that are not required for transfers of other types of real    estate. The replacement of a health care facility operator could    be delayed by the approval process of any federal, state or    local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the    replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility.    Alternatively, given the specialized nature of our facilities,    we may be required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt    these properties to other uses. If we are unable to timely    transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient    alternative uses, our revenue and operations may be adversely    affected. Risk    factors related to government regulations     Our obligors businesses are affected by government    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that an    operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues    from government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers,    government funding restrictions (at a program level or with    respect to specific facilities) and interruption or delays in    payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits    at such property. In recent years, government payors have frozen    or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary    pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be    of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We    cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect    any future legislative reforms may have on the financial    condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no    assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available    for services provided by any property operator, whether the    property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or    private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services    reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a    material adverse effect on an obligors liquidity,    financial    31Table of Contents    condition and results of operations, which could adversely    affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us.    See Item 1  Business  Certain    Government Regulations  Reimbursement above.     Our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive    federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure,    certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards.    Our operators or tenants failure to comply with any    of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of    accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines,    suspension or decertification from federal and state health care    programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such    actions may have an effect on our operators or    tenants ability to make lease payments to us and,    therefore, adversely impact us. See    Item 1  Business  Certain    Government Regulations  Other Related Laws    above.     Many of our properties may require a license, registration,    and/or CON    to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON,    or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would    prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the    operators or tenants. These events could materially adversely    affect our operators or tenants ability to make rent    payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the    expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or    acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or    renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or    other similar approval from a state agency. See    Item 1  Business  Certain    Government Regulations  Licensing and    Certification above.     The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009    (ARRA), which was signed into law on    February 17, 2009, provides $87 billion in additional    federal Medicaid funding for states Medicaid expenditures    between October 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. On    August 10, 2010, the President signed into law H.R. 1586,    which mandates a six-month extension of the increase in federal    Medicaid funding for states through June 30, 2011, although    the enhanced federal Medicaid funding is scaled back for the    first two quarters of 2011. Under both the ARRA and H.R. 1586,    states meeting certain eligibility requirements will temporarily    receive additional money in the form of an increase in the    federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). Thus,    for a limited period of time, the share of Medicaid costs that    are paid for by the federal government will go up, and each    states share will go down. We cannot predict whether    states are, or will remain, eligible to receive the additional    federal Medicaid funding, or whether the states will have    sufficient funds for their Medicaid programs. We also cannot    predict the impact that such broad-based, far-reaching    legislation will have on the U.S. economy or our business. Risk    factors related to liability claims and insurance    costs     In recent years, skilled nursing and seniors housing operators    have experienced substantial increases in both the number and    size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and    professional liability costs have increased in some markets.    However, a recent report and state survey found that the    liability insurance market is beginning to stabilize in most    markets. In 2008, national average liability loss costs were    stable for the first time in nearly a decade. State-led tort    reform efforts have greatly contributed to decreasing costs. In    some markets general and professional liability insurance    coverage continues to be restricted or very costly, which in    some cases has caused operators to self-insure. These    developments may adversely affect the property operators    future operations, cash flows and financial condition, and may    have a material adverse effect on the property operators    ability to meet their obligations to us. Risk    factors related to acquisitions     We are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired    properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired    properties might require significant management attention that    would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree    to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the    project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure    completion of the project. Moreover, if we issue equity    securities or incur additional debt, or both, to finance future    acquisitions, it may reduce our per share financial results.    These costs may negatively affect our results of operations.    32Table of ContentsRisk    factors related to joint ventures     We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter    into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or    entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not    be present with other methods of ownership, including the    possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to    make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet    its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us    for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at    any time have economic or other business interests or goals that    are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we    could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could    require us to expend additional resources to resolve such    disputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and    profitability of the joint venture; and that our partner may be    in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our    instructions or requests. In addition, our ability to transfer    our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be    restricted. In some instances, we    and/or our    partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement,    which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our    partners interest, at a time when we otherwise would not    have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our    partners interest may be limited if we do not have    sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital    resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest    in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain    it. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making    authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to    control the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have    a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require    partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of    a property. Risk    factors related to life sciences facilities     Our tenants in the life sciences industry face high levels of    regulation, expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect    their ability to make payments to us. Research, development and    clinical testing of products and technologies can be very    expensive and sources of funds may not be available to our life    sciences tenants in the future. The products and technologies    that are developed and manufactured by our life sciences tenants    may require regulatory approval prior to being made, marketed,    sold and used. The regulatory process can be costly, long and    unpredictable. Even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and    market acceptance, the product still presents regulatory and    liability risks, such as safety concerns, competition from new    products and eventually the expiration of patent protection.    These factors may affect the ability of our life sciences    tenants to make timely payments to us, which may adversely    affect our revenue and operations. Risk    factors related to indebtedness     Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided    through a combination of public and private offerings of debt    and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of    secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may    cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require    us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment    of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn    in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional    financing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or    outlook by one or more of the noted rating agencies.     Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,    create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of    these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments    governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other    indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These    defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business,    results of operations and financial condition. Risk    factors related to our credit ratings     We plan to manage the Company to maintain a capital structure    consistent with our current profile, but there can be no    assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit    ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or    all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse    impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in    turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results    of operations, liquidity    and/or    financial condition.    33Table of ContentsRisk    factors related to interest rate swaps     We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to    manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. These    swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that    counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these    arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be    effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.    When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a    risk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against    which the swap is intended to hedge. If such events occur, our    results of operations may be adversely affected. Risk    factors related to environmental laws     Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of    real estate may be required to respond to the presence or    release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held    liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that    result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous    substances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for    damages and costs it incurs in connection with the    contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person    based on the persons relationship to the property. Our    tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition    of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site    assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to    taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to    meet the all appropriate inquiry standard, which we    believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if    environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we    do not believe that any of our properties are subject to    material environmental contamination. However, environmental    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material    adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the    business or financial condition of our obligors. Risk    factors related to facilities that require entrance    fees     Certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of    an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may    be refundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are    subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to    these funds. As a result of this oversight, residents of these    facilities may have a variety of rights, including, for example,    the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of    time and certain lien rights. The oversight and rights of    residents within these facilities may have an effect on the    revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and    therefore may negatively impact us. Risk    factors related to facilities under construction or    development     At any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one    or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON and    license before they can be utilized by the operator for their    intended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and    Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid    provider agreements    and/or third    party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable    to obtain the necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider    agreements or contracts after the completion of construction,    there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on    the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license    or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary    provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract    with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate    the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider    agreements or contracts.     In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development    and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain,    or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use,    building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and    authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or    our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be    able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us    unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may    not be able to complete construction and    lease-up of    a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt    service expense or construction costs.     Additionally, the time frame required for development,    construction and    lease-up of    these properties means that we may have to wait years for    significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash    distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from    operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to    borrow    34Table of Contents    additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and    acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we    expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial    performance.     In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property,    we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of    that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our    investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. If our    financial projections with respect to a new property are    inaccurate, and the property is unable to achieve the expected    occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we    expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs    of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove    to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our    profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties    that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing    operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and    debt service associated with that property. We do    not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases, and if    they do not, we may be unable to lease the properties on as    favorable terms, or at all     We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases    at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times.    If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find    other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them. There can    be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable    replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on    terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would    be able to lease those properties at all. Our    ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the    loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground    leases     We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by    acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the    building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in    the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases.    As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the    possibility of losing the property upon termination of the    ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us. Illiquidity    of real estate investments could significantly impede our    ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our    properties     Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to    quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to    changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No    assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for    any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons.    Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance    of our investments could adversely affect our financial    condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed    to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real    estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care    industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could    adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to    sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Risk    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds     From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master    leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to    maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive    returns, we expect to re-invest these proceeds in a timely    manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad    variety of potential investors. This competition for attractive    investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely    investments on terms acceptable to us. Failure    to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our    management or increase our expenses     We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively    short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in    the future. This growth has resulted in increased levels of    responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions    could place significant additional demands on, and require us to    expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure to    manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business    and, in particular, our financial condition, results of    operations and cash flows, which could negatively    35Table of Contents    affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our    growth could also increase our capital requirements, which may    require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and    incur additional debt. We    might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a    REIT     We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code    and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a    manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious    income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds    available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to    our stockholders because:           we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to    stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be    subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate    rates;           we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and    possibly increased state and local taxes; and           unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we    could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which we were disqualified.     Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of    U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in    our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our    stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we would not be    required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT    is not required, in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an    excise tax, to pay dividends to stockholders. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax Considerations for    a discussion of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that    apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a REIT.     In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions    to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the    extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits,    although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the    dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be    eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to    long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%)    with respect to distributions.     As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a    REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business    strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common    stock.     Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly    technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which    there are only limited judicial and administrative    interpretations. The determination of various factual matters    and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our    ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that    we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue    to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal    income tax purposes. See Item 1     Business  Taxation  Federal Income Tax    Considerations included in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K. The    90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity    and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial    transactions     To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to    REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make    distributions to our stockholders. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax    Considerations  Qualification as a REIT     Annual Distribution Requirements included in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient    cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT    distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to    time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to    meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may decide to    retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be    necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due    to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and    actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the    inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in    arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition,    non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or    repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash    deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or    liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution    requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we    deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue    additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that    we will be able to do so), pay taxable    36Table of Contents    stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or    securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable    us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require    us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations.     The amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by    the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures    governing our senior unsecured notes. In addition, adverse    economic conditions may impact the availability of additional    funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow    additional funds to become unfavorable. In those circumstances,    we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital    markets. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors    over which we have little or no control, including rising    interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions    and the markets perception of our growth potential and our    current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and    the market price of the shares of our capital stock. We cannot    assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary    to make future investments or to meet our obligations and    commitments as they mature. The    lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT    subsidiary is subject to special requirements     We intend to lease certain qualified health care properties we    acquire from operators to a taxable REIT subsidiary (or a    limited liability company of which the taxable REIT subsidiary    is a member), which lessee will contract with such operators (or    a related party) to operate the health care operations at these    properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee    structure will be treated as qualifying rents from real property    if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a    qualified health care property with a taxable REIT subsidiary    and (2) the operator qualifies as an eligible independent    contractor. If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then    the rents will not be qualifying rents. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax    Considerations  Qualification as a REIT     Income Tests. If    certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the    IRS as true leases, we may be subject to adverse tax    consequences     We may purchase properties and lease them back to the sellers of    such properties. We intend for any such sale-leaseback    transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease    will be characterized as a true lease, thereby    allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for    U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the    terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the    position that the transaction is not a true lease    but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event    any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully    re-characterized by the IRS, we would not be entitled to claim    the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally    available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a    sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might    fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and,    consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year    of re-characterization. See Item 1     Business  Taxation  Federal Income Tax    Considerations  Qualification as a REIT     Asset Tests and  Income Tests.    Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be    recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual    distribution requirements for a taxable year. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax    Considerations  Qualification as a REIT     Annual Distribution Requirements. Other    risk factors     We are also subject to other risks. First, our Second Restated    Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated    By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions (staggered board    provisions, restrictions on share ownership and transfer and    super majority stockholder approval requirements for business    combinations) that could make it more difficult for or even    prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of    our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that    inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market    value of our common stock.     Additionally, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we    have entered into employment agreements with our executive    officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily,    have an adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing    more than one could have a material adverse impact on our    business.    37Table of Contents"
7,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2010-02-26,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Forward-Looking    Statements and Risk Factors
     This section discusses the most significant factors that affect    our business, operations and financial condition. It does not    describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our    industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following    risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet    identified or that we currently think are not material, actually    occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In that event,    the value of our securities could decline.     This Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements    that constitute forward-looking statements as that    term is defined in the federal securities laws. These    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,    those regarding:           the possible expansion of our portfolio;           the sale of properties;           the performance of our operators/tenants and properties;           our ability to enter into agreements with new viable tenants for    vacant space or for properties that we take back from    financially troubled tenants, if any;           our occupancy rates;           our ability to acquire, develop    and/or    manage properties;           our ability to make distributions to stockholders;           our policies and plans regarding investments, financings and    other matters;           our tax status as a real estate investment trust;           our critical accounting policies;           our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;           our ability to access capital markets or other sources of    funds; and           our ability to meet our earnings guidance.     When we use words such as may, will,    intend, should, believe,    expect, anticipate, project,    estimate or similar expressions, we are making    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not    guarantees of future performance and involve risks and    uncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and    actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This    may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited    to:           the status of the economy;           the status of capital markets, including availability and cost    of capital;           issues facing the health care industry, including compliance    with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies,    responding to government investigations and punitive settlements    and operators/tenants difficulty in cost-effectively    obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;           changes in financing terms;    28Table of Contents           competition within the health care and senior housing industries;           negative developments in the operating results or financial    condition of operators/tenants, including, but not limited to,    their ability to pay rent and repay loans;           our ability to transition or sell facilities with profitable    results;           the failure to make new investments as and when anticipated;           acts of God affecting our properties;           our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies    occur;           our ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to    assets sold;           operator/tenant bankruptcies or insolvencies;           government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid    reimbursement rates and operational requirements;           liability or contract claims by or against operators/tenants;           unanticipated difficulties    and/or    expenditures relating to future acquisitions;           environmental laws affecting our properties;           changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;           other legal and operational matters, including REIT    qualification and key management personnel recruitment and    retention; and           the risks described below: Risk    factors related to our operators revenues and    expenses     Our investment property operators revenues are primarily    driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if    applicable, and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities    are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities,    taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from    government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under    pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.    Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for    our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues    and/or any    increase in operating expenses result in a property not    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be    relied upon.     The ongoing credit and liquidity crisis, and the weakening    economy, may have an adverse effect on our operators and    tenants, including their ability to access credit or maintain    occupancy rates. If the operations, cash flows or financial    condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by    the current economic conditions, our revenue and operations may    be adversely affected. Increased    competition may affect our operators ability to meet their    obligations to us     The operators of our properties compete on a local and regional    basis with operators of properties and other health care    providers that provide comparable services. We cannot be certain    that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to    achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable    them to meet all of their obligations to us. Our operators are    expected to encounter increased competition in the future that    could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their    businesses. Risk    factors related to obligor bankruptcies     We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,    which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that    an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency    proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease    agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand    immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our    loans    29Table of Contents    provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation,    demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest,    foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the    bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party    that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An obligor in    bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to    limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of    a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case    of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies.     We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment    property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property    and/or    transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we    have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property    to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided    working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new    obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new    tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may    expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events    occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely    affected. Transfers    of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and    these facilities may not have efficient alternative    uses     Transfers of health care facilities to successor operators    frequently are subject to regulatory approvals, including change    of ownership approvals under certificate of need    (CON) laws, state licensure laws and Medicare and    Medicaid provider arrangements, that are not required for    transfers of other types of real estate. The replacement of an    operator could be delayed by the approval process of any    federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the    facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage    the facility. Alternatively, given the specialized nature of our    facilities, we may be required to spend substantial time and    funds to adapt these properties to other uses. If we are unable    to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find    efficient alternative uses, our revenue and operations may be    adversely affected. Risk    factors related to government regulations     Our obligors businesses are affected by government    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that an    operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues    from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers,    government funding restrictions (at a program level or with    respect to specific facilities) and interruption or delays in    payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and    audits at such property. In recent years, governmental payors    have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to    budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely    continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state    authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate    timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the    financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be    no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be    available for services provided by any property operator,    whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare,    Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of    services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could    have a material adverse effect on an obligors liquidity,    financial condition and results of operations, which could    adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its    obligations to us. See Item 1     Business  Certain Government Regulations     Reimbursement above.     Our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive    federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection    laws and regulations. Our operators or tenants    failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of    accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines,    suspension or decertification from federal and state health care    programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such    actions may have an effect on our operators or    tenants ability to make lease payments to us and,    therefore, adversely impact us. See    Item 1  Business  Certain    Government Regulations  Other Related Laws    above.     Many of our properties may require a license    and/or CON    to operate. Failure to obtain a license or CON, or loss of a    required license or CON would prevent a facility from operating    in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events    could materially adversely affect our operators or    tenants ability to make rent payments to us. State and    local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition    of new beds or services or acquisition of    30Table of Contents    medical equipment, and the construction of health care    facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval. See    Item 1  Business  Certain    Government Regulations  Licensing and    Certification above.     The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, which was    signed into law on February 17, 2009, provides    $87 billion in additional federal Medicaid funding for    states Medicaid expenditures between October 1, 2008    and December 31, 2010. Under this Act, states meeting    certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive    additional money in the form of an increase in the federal    medical assistance percentage (FMAP). Thus, for a limited period    of time, the share of Medicaid costs that are paid for by the    federal government will go up, and each states share will    go down. We cannot predict whether states are, or will remain,    eligible to receive the additional federal Medicaid funding, or    whether the states will have sufficient funds for their Medicaid    programs. We also cannot predict the impact that this    broad-based, far-reaching legislation will have on the    U.S. economy or our business. Risk    factors related to liability claims and insurance    costs     In recent years, skilled nursing and seniors housing operators    have experienced substantial increases in both the number and    size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and    professional liability costs have increased in some markets.    However, a recent report and state survey found that the    liability insurance market is beginning to stabilize in most    markets. In 2008, national average liability loss costs were    stable for the first time in nearly a decade. State-led tort    reform efforts have greatly contributed to decreasing costs. In    some markets general and professional liability insurance    coverage continues to be restricted or very costly, which may    adversely affect the property operators future operations,    cash flows and financial condition, and may have a material    adverse effect on the property operators ability to meet    their obligations to us. Risk    factors related to acquisitions     We are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired    properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired    properties might require significant management attention that    would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree    to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the    project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure    completion of the project. Moreover, if we issue equity    securities or incur additional debt, or both, to finance future    acquisitions, it may reduce our per share financial results.    These costs may negatively affect our results of operations. Risk    factors related to joint ventures     We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter    into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or    entities. Joint venture investments involve risks, including the    possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise    refuse to make capital contributions when due; that our partner    might at any time have investment goals which are inconsistent    with ours; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our    partner, which could require us to expend additional resources    to resolve such disputes; and that our partner may be in a    position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our    instructions or requests. In addition, our ability to transfer    our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be    restricted. In some instances, we and our partner may each have    the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause    us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners interest,    at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a    transaction. Joint ventures require us to share decision-making    authority with our partners, which limits our ability to control    the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a    controlling interest, certain major decisions may require    partner approval. Risk    factors related to life sciences facilities     Our tenants in the life sciences industry face high levels of    regulation, expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect    their ability to make payments to us. Research, development and    clinical testing of products and technologies can be very    expensive and sources of funds may not be available to our life    sciences tenants in the future. The products and technologies    that are developed and manufactured by our life sciences tenants    may require regulatory approval prior to being made, marketed,    sold and used. The regulatory process can be costly, long and    31Table of Contents    unpredictable. Even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and    market acceptance, the product still presents regulatory and    liability risks, such as safety concerns, competition from new    products and eventually the expiration of patent protection.    These factors may affect the ability of our life sciences    tenants to make timely payments to us, which may adversely    affect our revenue and operations. Risk    factors related to indebtedness     Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided    through a combination of public and private offerings of debt    and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of    secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may    cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require    us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment    of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn    in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional    financing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or    outlook by one or more of the noted rating agencies.     Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,    create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of    these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments    governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other    indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These    defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business,    results of operations and financial condition. Risk    factors related to our credit ratings     As of February 12, 2010, our senior unsecured notes were    rated Baa2 (stable), BBB- (positive) and BBB (stable) by    Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors    Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, respectively. We plan to    manage the Company to maintain investment grade status with a    capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there    can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current    credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by    any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material    adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which    could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated    results of operations, liquidity    and/or    financial condition. Risk    factors related to interest rate swaps     We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to    manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. These    swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that    counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these    arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be    effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.    When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a    risk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against    which the swap is intended to hedge. If such events occur, our    results of operations may be adversely affected. Risk    factors related to environmental laws     Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of    real estate may be required to respond to the presence or    release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held    liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that    result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous    substances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for    damages and costs it incurs in connection with the    contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person    based on the persons relationship to the property. Our    tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition    of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site    assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to    taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to    meet the all appropriate inquiry standard, which we    believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if    environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we    do not believe that any of our properties are subject to    material environmental contamination. However, environmental    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material    adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the    business or financial condition of our obligors.    32Table of Contents Risk    factors related to facilities that require entrance    fees     Certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of    an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may    be refundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are    subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to    these funds. As a result of this oversight, residents of these    facilities may have a variety of rights, including, for example,    the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of    time and certain lien rights. The oversight and rights of    residents within these facilities may have an effect on the    revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and    therefore may negatively impact us. Risk    factors related to facilities under construction or    development     At any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one    or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON and    license before they can be utilized by the operator for their    intended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and    Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid    provider agreements    and/or third    party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable    to obtain the necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider    agreements or contracts after the completion of construction,    there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on    the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license    or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary    provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract    with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate    the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider    agreements or contracts.     In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development    and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain,    or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use,    building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and    authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or    our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be    able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us    unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may    not be able to complete construction and    lease-up of    a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt    service expense or construction costs.     Additionally, the time frame required for development,    construction and    lease-up of    these properties means that we may have to wait years for    significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash    distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from    operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to    borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly    developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow    that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall    financial performance.     In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property,    we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of    that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our    investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. If our    financial projections with respect to a new property are    inaccurate, and the property is unable to achieve the expected    occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we    expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs    of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove    to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our    profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties    that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing    operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and    debt service associated with that property. We do    not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases, and if    they do not, we may be unable to lease the properties on as    favorable terms, or at all     We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases    at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times    through 2079. If these leases are not renewed, we would be    required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or    sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to    identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with    new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or    that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our    ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the    loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground    leases     We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by    acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the    building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in    the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases.    As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the    possibility of losing the property upon termination of the    ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.    33Table of ContentsIlliquidity    of real estate investments could significantly impede our    ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our    properties     Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to    quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to    changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No    assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for    any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons.    Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance    of our investments could adversely affect our financial    condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed    to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real    estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care    industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could    adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to    sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Risk    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds     From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master    leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to    maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive    returns, we expect to re-invest these proceeds in a timely    manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad    variety of potential investors. This competition for attractive    investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely    investments on terms acceptable to us. Failure    to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our    management or increase our expenses     We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively    short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in    the future. This growth has resulted in increased levels of    responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions    could place significant additional demands on, and require us to    expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure to    manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business    and, in particular, our financial condition, results of    operations and cash flows, which could negatively affect our    ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our growth could    also increase our capital requirements, which may require us to    issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur    additional debt. We    might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a    REIT     We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code    and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a    manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious    tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds    available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to    our stockholders for each of the years involved because:           we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to    stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be    subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;           we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and    possibly increased state and local taxes; and           unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we    could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which we were disqualified.     Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of    federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the    amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not    qualify as a REIT, we would not be required to make    distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not required,    in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax, to pay    dividends to stockholders. See Item 1     Business  Federal Income Tax Considerations for    a discussion of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that    apply to us and the effects of non-qualification.     In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions    to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the    extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits,    although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the    dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be    eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to    long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%)    with respect to distributions.     As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a    REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business    strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common    stock.    34Table of Contents    Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly    technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which    there are only limited judicial and administrative    interpretations. The determination of various factual matters    and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our    ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that    we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue    to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax Considerations    included in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K. The    90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity    and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial    transactions     To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to    REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make    distributions to our stockholders. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax    Considerations  Qualification as a REIT     Annual Distribution Requirements included in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient    cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT    distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to    time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to    meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may decide to    retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be    necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due    to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and    actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the    inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in    arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition,    non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or    repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash    deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or    liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution    requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we    deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue    additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that    we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if    possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a    transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution    requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to    meet our obligations.     The amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by    the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures    governing our senior unsecured notes. In addition, adverse    economic conditions may impact the availability of additional    funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow    additional funds to become unfavorable. In those circumstances,    we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital    markets. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors    over which we have little or no control, including rising    interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions    and the markets perception of our growth potential and our    current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and    the market price of the shares of our capital stock. We cannot    assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary    to make future investments or to meet our obligations and    commitments as they mature. Other    risk factors     We are also subject to other risks. First, our Second Restated    Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated    By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions (staggered board    provisions, restrictions on share ownership and transfer and    super majority stockholder approval requirements for business    combinations) that could make it more difficult for or even    prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of    our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that    inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market    value of our common stock.     Additionally, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we    have entered into employment agreements with our executive    officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily,    have an adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing    more than one could have a material adverse impact on our    business. "
17,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2009-03-02,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Forward-Looking    Statements and Risk Factors
     This section discusses the most significant factors that affect    our business, operations and financial condition. It does not    describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our    industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following    risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet    identified or that we currently think are not material, actually    occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In that event,    the value of our securities could decline.     This Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements    that constitute forward-looking statements as that    term is defined in the federal securities laws. These    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,    those regarding:           the possible expansion of our portfolio;           the sale of properties;           the performance of our operators/tenants and properties;           our ability to enter into agreements with new viable tenants for    vacant space or for properties that we take back from    financially troubled tenants, if any;           our occupancy rates;           our ability to acquire, develop    and/or    manage properties;           our ability to make distributions to stockholders;           our policies and plans regarding investments, financings and    other matters;           our tax status as a real estate investment trust;           our critical accounting policies;           our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;           our ability to access capital markets or other sources of    funds; and           our ability to meet our earnings guidance.     When we use words such as may, will,    intend, should, believe,    expect, anticipate, project,    estimate or similar expressions, we are making    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not    guarantees of future performance and involve risks and    uncertainties. Our expected results may not be achieved, and    28Table of Contents    actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This    may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited    to:           the status of the economy;           the status of capital markets, including availability and cost    of capital;           issues facing the health care industry, including compliance    with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies,    responding to government investigations and punitive settlements    and operators/tenants difficulty in cost-effectively    obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;           changes in financing terms;           competition within the health care and senior housing industries;           negative developments in the operating results or financial    condition of operators/tenants, including, but not limited to,    their ability to pay rent and repay loans;           our ability to transition or sell facilities with profitable    results;           the failure to make new investments as and when anticipated;           acts of God affecting our properties;           our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies    occur;           our ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to    assets sold;           operator/tenant bankruptcies or insolvencies;           government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid    reimbursement rates and operational requirements;           liability or contract claims by or against operators/tenants;           unanticipated difficulties    and/or    expenditures relating to future acquisitions;           environmental laws affecting our properties;           changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;           other legal and operational matters, including REIT    qualification and key management personnel recruitment and    rentention; and           the risks described below: Risk    factors related to our operators revenues and    expenses     Our investment property operators revenues are primarily    driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if    applicable, and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities    are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities,    taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from    government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under    pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.    Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for    our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues    and/or any    increase in operating expenses result in a property not    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be    relied upon.     The recent and ongoing credit and liquidity crisis, and the    weakening economy, may have an adverse effect on our operators    and tenants, including their ability to access credit or    maintain occupancy rates. If the operations, cash flows or    financial condition of our operators are materially adversely    impacted by the current economic conditions, our revenue and    operations may be adversely affected.    29Table of ContentsIncreased    competition may affect our operators ability to meet their    obligations to us     The operators of our properties compete on a local and regional    basis with operators of properties and other health care    providers that provide comparable services. We cannot be certain    that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to    achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable    them to meet all of their obligations to us. Our operators are    expected to encounter increased competition in the future that    could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their    businesses. Risk    factors related to obligor bankruptcies     We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,    which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that    an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency    proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease    agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand    immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our    loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding    obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid    interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other    remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain    rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or    reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to    insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability    to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive    unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to    exercise other rights and remedies.     We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment    property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property    and/or    transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we    have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property    to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided    working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new    obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new    tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may    expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events    occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely    affected. Transfers    of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and    these facilities may not have efficient alternative    uses     Transfers of health care facilities to successor operators    frequently are subject to regulatory approvals, including change    of ownership approvals under certificate of need    (CON) laws, state licensure laws and Medicare and    Medicaid provider arrangements, that are not required for    transfers of other types of real estate. The replacement of an    operator could be delayed by the approval process of any    federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the    facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage    the facility. Alternatively, given the specialized nature of our    facilities, we may be required to spend substantial time and    funds to adapt these properties to other uses. If we are unable    to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find    efficient alternative uses, our revenue and operations may be    adversely affected. Risk    factors related to government regulations     Our obligors businesses are affected by government    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that an    operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues    from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers,    government funding restrictions (at a program level or with    respect to specific facilities) and interruption or delays in    payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and    audits at such property. In recent years, governmental payors    have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to    budgetary pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely    continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state    authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate    timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the    financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be    no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be    available for services provided by any property operator,    whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare,    Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of    services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could    have a material adverse effect on an obligors liquidity,    financial    30Table of Contents    condition and results of operations, which could adversely    affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us.    See Item 1  Business  Certain    Government Regulations  Reimbursement above.     Our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive    federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection    laws and regulations. Our operators or tenants    failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of    accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines,    suspension or decertification from federal and state health care    programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such    actions may have an effect on our operators or    tenants ability to make lease payments to us and,    therefore, adversely impact us. See    Item 1  Business  Certain    Government Regulations  Other Related Laws    above.     Many of our properties may require a license    and/or CON    to operate. Failure to obtain a license or CON, or loss of a    required license or CON would prevent a facility from operating    in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events    could materially adversely affect our operators or    tenants ability to make rent payments to us. State and    local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition    of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and    the construction of health care facilities, by requiring a CON    or other similar approval. See Item 1     Business  Certain Government Regulations     Licensing and Certification above.     The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, which was    signed into law on February 17, 2009, provides    $87 billion in additional federal Medicaid funding for    states Medicaid expenditures between October 1, 2008    and December 31, 2010. Under this Act, states meeting    certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive    additional money in the form of an increase in the federal    medical assistance percentage (FMAP). Thus, for a limited period    of time, the share of Medicaid costs that are paid for by the    federal government will go up, and each states share will    go down. We cannot predict whether states are, or will remain,    eligible to receive the additional federal Medicaid funding, or    whether the states will have sufficient funds for their Medicaid    programs. We also cannot predict the impact that this    broad-based, far-reaching legislation will have on the    U.S. economy or our business. Risk    factors related to liability claims and insurance    costs     Long-term care property operators (skilled nursing facilities,    assisted living facilities, and independent living/continuing    care retirement communities) have experienced substantial    increases in both the number and size of patient care liability    claims in recent years. As a result, general and professional    liability costs have increased in some markets. No assurances    can be given that the climate for long-term care general and    professional liability insurance will improve in any states    where the property operators conduct business. Insurance    companies may reduce or stop writing general and professional    liability policies for long-term care facilities. Thus, general    and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted    or very costly, which may adversely affect the property    operators future operations, cash flows and financial    condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the    property operators ability to meet their obligations to us. Risk    factors related to acquisitions     We are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired    properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired    properties might require significant management attention that    would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree    to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the    project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure    completion of the project. Moreover, if we issue equity    securities or incur additional debt, or both, to finance future    acquisitions, it may reduce our per share financial results.    These costs may negatively affect our results of operations. Risk    factors related to indebtedness     Permanent financing for our investments is typically provided    through a combination of public and private offerings of debt    and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of    secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may    cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require    us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment    of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn    in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional    financing, or (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or    outlook by one or more of the noted rating agencies.    31Table of Contents    Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and    events of default. Among other things, these provisions require    us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth    and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness,    create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of    these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments    governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other    indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These    defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business,    results of operations and financial condition. Risk    factors related to our credit ratings     As of February 16, 2009, our senior unsecured notes were    rated Baa2 (stable), BBB- (stable) and BBB (stable) by    Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors    Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, respectively. We plan to    manage the Company to maintain investment grade status with a    capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there    can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current    credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by    any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material    adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which    could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated    results of operations, liquidity    and/or    financial condition. Risk    factors related to interest rate swaps     We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to    manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. These    swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that    counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these    arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be    effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.    When we use forward-starting interest rate swaps, there is a    risk that we will not complete the long-term borrowing against    which the swap is intended to hedge. If such events occur, our    results of operations may be adversely affected. Risk    factors related to environmental laws     Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of    real estate may be required to respond to the presence or    release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held    liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that    result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous    substances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for    damages and costs it incurs in connection with the    contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person    based on the persons relationship to the property. Our    tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition    of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site    assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to    taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to    meet the all appropriate inquiry standard, which we    believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if    environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we    do not believe that any of our properties are subject to    material environmental contamination. However, environmental    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material    adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the    business or financial condition of our obligors. Risk    factors related to facilities that require entrance    fees     Certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of    an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may    be refundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are    subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to    these funds. As a result of this oversight, residents of these    facilities may have a variety of rights, including, for example,    the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of    time and certain lien rights. The oversight and rights of    residents within these facilities may have an effect on the    revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and    therefore may negatively impact us. Risk    factors related to facilities under construction or    development     At any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one    or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON and    license before they can be utilized by the operator for their    intended use. The operator also may need to obtain Medicare and    Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid    provider agreements    32Table of Contentsand/or third    party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable    to obtain the necessary CON, licensure, certification, provider    agreements or contracts after the completion of construction,    there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on    the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license    or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary    provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract    with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate    the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider    agreements or contracts.     In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development    and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain,    or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use,    building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and    authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or    our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be    able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us    unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may    not be able to complete construction and    lease-up of    a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt    service expense or construction costs.     Additionally, the time frame required for development,    construction and    lease-up of    these properties means that we may have to wait years for    significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash    distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from    operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to    borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly    developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow    that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall    financial performance.     In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property,    we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of    that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our    investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. If our    financial projections with respect to a new property are    inaccurate, and the property is unable to achieve the expected    occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we    expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs    of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove    to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our    profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties    that are not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing    operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and    debt service associated with that property. We do    not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases, and if    they do not, we may be unable to lease the properties on as    favorable terms, or at all     We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases    at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times    through 2045. If these leases are not renewed, we would be    required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or    sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to    identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with    new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or    that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our    ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the    loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground    leases     We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by    acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the    building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in    the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases.    As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the    possibility of losing the property upon termination of the    ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us. Illiquidity    of real estate investments could significantly impede our    ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our    properties     Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to    quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to    changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No    assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for    any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons.    Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance    of our investments could adversely affect our financial    condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed    to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real    estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and healthcare    industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could    adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to    sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.    33Table of ContentsRisk    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds     From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master    leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to    maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive    returns, we expect to re-invest these proceeds in a timely    manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad    variety of potential investors. This competition for attractive    investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely    investments on terms acceptable to us. Failure    to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our    management or increase our expenses     We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively    short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in    the future. Our rapid growth has resulted in increased levels of    responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions    could place significant additional demands on, and require us to    expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure to    manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business    and, in particular, our financial condition, results of    operations and cash flows, which could negatively affect our    ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our rapid growth    could also increase our capital requirements, which may require    us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur    additional debt. We    might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a    REIT     We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code    and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a    manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious    tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds    available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to    our stockholders for each of the years involved because:           we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to    stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be    subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;           we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and    possibly increased state and local taxes; and           unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we    could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which we were disqualified.     Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of    federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the    amount we could distribute to our stockholders. Also, if we were    not a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions to    stockholders since a non-REIT is not required, in order to avoid    an excise tax, to pay dividends to stockholders amounting to at    least the sum of: (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for    the year; (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain income for such    year (other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay    tax on); and (3) any undistributed taxable income from    preceding periods. See Item 1     Business  Federal Income Tax Considerations for    a discussion of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that    apply to us and the effects of non-qualification.     In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions    to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the    extent of our current and accumulated earning and profits,    although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the    dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be    eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to    long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%)    with respect to distributions.     As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a    REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business    strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common    stock.     Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly    technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which    there are only limited judicial and administrative    interpretations. The determination of various factual matters    and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our    ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that    we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue    to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax Considerations    included in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K.    34Table of ContentsThe    90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity    and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial    transactions     To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to    REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make    distributions to our stockholders. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax    Considerations  Qualification as a REIT     Annual Distribution Requirements included in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient    cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT    distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to    time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to    meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may decide to    retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be    necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due    to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and    actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the    inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in    arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition,    non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or    repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash    deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or    liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution    requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we    deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue    additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that    we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if    possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a    transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution    requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to    meet our obligations.     The amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by    the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures    governing our senior unsecured notes. In addition, adverse    economic conditions may impact the availability of additional    funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow    additional funds to become unfavorable. In those circumstances,    we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital    markets. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors    over which we have little or no control, including rising    interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions    and the markets perception of our growth potential and our    current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and    the market price of the shares of our capital stock. We cannot    assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary    to make future investments or to meet our obligations and    commitments as they mature. Other    risk factors     We are also subject to other risks. First, our Second Restated    Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws    contain anti-takeover provisions (staggered board provisions,    restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority    stockholder approval requirements for business combinations)    that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third    party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent    Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that inhibit or    discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of    our common stock.     Additionally, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we    have entered into employment agreements with our executive    officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily,    have an adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing    more than one could have a material adverse impact on our    business. "
1,WELL,WELLTOWER INC,2008-02-28,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Forward-Looking    Statements and Risk Factors
     This section discusses the most significant factors that affect    our business, operations and financial condition. It does not    describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our    industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following    risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet    identified or that we currently think are not material, actually    occur, we could be materially adversely affected. In that event,    the value of our securities could decline.     This Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements    that constitute forward-looking statements as that    term is defined in the federal securities laws. These    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,    those regarding:           the possible expansion of our portfolio;           the sale of properties;           the performance of our operators/tenants and properties;           our ability to enter into agreements with new viable tenants for    properties that we take back from financially troubled tenants,    if any;           our ability to retain or increase occupancies in our medical    office buildings at similar or higher rates;           our ability to make distributions to stockholders;           our policies and plans regarding investments, financings and    other matters;           our tax status as a real estate investment trust;           our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;           our ability to access capital markets or other sources of    funds; and           our ability to meet our earnings guidance.     When we use words such as may, will,    intend, should, believe,    expect, anticipate, estimate    or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking    statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of    future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Our    expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may    differ materially from our expectations. This may be a result of    various factors, including, but not limited to:           the status of the economy;           the status of capital markets, including prevailing interest    rates;           issues facing the health care industry, including compliance    with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies,    responding to government investigations and punitive settlements    and operators/tenants difficulty in cost-effectively    obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;           changes in financing terms;    26Table of Contents           competition within the health care and senior housing industries;           negative developments in the operating results or financial    condition of operators/tenants, including, but not limited to,    their ability to pay rent and repay loans;           our ability to transition or sell facilities with profitable    results;           the failure to make new investments as and when anticipated;           the failure of closings to occur as and when anticipated;           acts of God affecting our properties;           our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies    occur;           our ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to    assets sold;           operator/tenant bankruptcies or insolvencies;           government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid    reimbursement rates and operational requirements;           liability or contract claims by or against operators/tenants;           unanticipated difficulties    and/or    expenditures relating to future acquisitions;           environmental laws affecting our properties;           changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;           other legal and operational matters, including REIT    qualification and key management personnel recruitment and    rentention; and           the risks described below: Risk    factors related to our operators revenues and    expenses     Our investment property operators revenues are primarily    driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if    applicable, and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities    are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities,    taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from    government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under    pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.    Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for    our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues    and/or any    increase in operating expenses result in a property not    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be    relied upon. Risk    factors related to obligor bankruptcies     We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,    which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that    an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency    proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease    agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand    immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our    loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding    obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid    interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other    remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain    rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or    reorganization. An obligor in bankruptcy or subject to    insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability    to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive    unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to    exercise other rights and remedies.     We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment    property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property    and/or    transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we    have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property    to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided    working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new    obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new    tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may    expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events    occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely    affected.    27Table of ContentsTransfers    of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and    these facilities may not have efficient alternative    uses     Transfers of health care facilities to successor operators    frequently are subject to regulatory approvals, including change    of ownership approvals under certificate of need    (CON) laws and Medicare and Medicaid provider    arrangements, that are not required for transfers of other types    of real estate. The replacement of an operator could be delayed    by the approval process of any federal, state or local agency    necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of    the operator licensed to manage the facility. Alternatively,    given the specialized nature of our facilities, we may be    required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt these    properties to other uses. If we are unable to timely transfer    properties to successor operators or find efficient alternative    uses, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected. Risk    factors related to government regulations     Our obligors businesses are affected by government    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that an    operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues    from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries, government    funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to    specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due    to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such    property. In recent years, governmental payors have frozen or    reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary    pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be    of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We    cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect    any future legislative reforms may have on the financial    condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no    assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available    for services provided by any property operator, whether the    property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or    private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services    reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a    material adverse effect on an obligors liquidity,    financial condition and results of operations, which could    adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its    obligations to us. See Item 1     Business  Certain Government Regulations     Reimbursement above.     Our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive    federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection    laws and regulations. Our operators or tenants    failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of    accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines,    suspension or decertification from federal and state health care    programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such    actions may have an effect on our operators or    tenants ability to make lease payments to us and,    therefore, adversely impact us.     Many of our properties may require a license    and/or CON    to operate. Failure to obtain a license or CON, or loss of a    required license or CON would prevent a facility from operating    in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events    could materially adversely affect our operators or    tenants ability to make rent payments to us. State and    local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition    of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and    the construction of health care facilities, by requiring a CON    or other similar approval. Risk    factors related to liability claims and insurance    costs     Long-term care property operators (skilled nursing facilities,    assisted living facilities, and independent living/continuing    care retirement communities) have experienced substantial    increases in both the number and size of patient care liability    claims in recent years. As a result, general and professional    liability costs have increased in some markets. No assurances    can be given that the climate for long-term care general and    professional liability insurance will improve in any states    where the property operators conduct business. Insurance    companies may reduce or stop writing general and professional    liability policies for long-term care facilities. Thus, general    and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted    or very costly, which may adversely affect the property    operators future operations, cash flows and financial    condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the    property operators ability to meet their obligations to us. Risk    factors related to acquisitions     We are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired    properties, including contingent liabilities, and    28Table of Contents    acquired properties might require significant management    attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing    business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an    operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to    take steps to ensure completion of the project. Moreover, if we    issue equity securities or incur additional debt, or both, to    finance future acquisitions, it may reduce our per share    financial results. These costs may negatively affect our results    of operations. Risk    factors related to environmental laws     Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of    real estate may be required to respond to the presence or    release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held    liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that    result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous    substances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for    damages and costs it incurs in connection with the    contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person    based on the persons relationship to the property. Our    tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition    of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site    assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to    taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to    meet the all appropriate inquiry standard, which we    believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if    environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we    do not believe that any of our properties are subject to    material environmental contamination. However, environmental    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material    adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the    business or financial condition of our obligors. Risk    factors related to facilities that require entrance    fees     Certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of    an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may    be refundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are    subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to    these funds. As a result of this oversight, residents of these    facilities may have a variety of rights, including, for example,    the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of    time and certain lien rights. The oversight and rights of    residents within these facilities may have an effect on the    revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and    therefore may negatively impact us. Risk    factors related to facilities under construction or    development     At any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one    or more new facilities that ultimately will require a CON and    license before they can be utilized by the operator for their    intended use. The operator also will need to obtain Medicare and    Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid    provider agreements or third party payor contracts. In the event    that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary CON,    licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after    the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not    be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the    initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate    the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or    contracts or we can find and contract with a new operator that    is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its    intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts.     In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development    and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain,    or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use,    building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and    authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or    our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be    able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us    unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may    not be able to complete construction and    lease-up of    a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt    service expense or construction costs.     Additionally, the time frame required for development,    construction and    lease-up of    these properties means that we may have to wait years for    significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash    distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from    operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to    borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly    developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow    that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall    financial performance.     In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property,    we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of    that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our    investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. If our    financial projections with respect to a new property are    inaccurate, and the    29Table of Contents    property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental    rates, it may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our    investment. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or    redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate,    which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals.    Additionally, we may acquire new properties that are not fully    leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may be    insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service    associated with that property. We do    not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases, and if    they do not, we may be unable to lease the properties on as    favorable terms, or at all     We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases    at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times    through 2029. If these leases are not renewed, we would be    required to find other tenants to occupy those properties. There    can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable    replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on    terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would    be able to lease those properties at all. Our    ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the    loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground    leases     We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by    acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the    building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in    the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases.    As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the    possibility of losing the property upon termination of the    ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us. Illiquidity    of real estate investments could significantly impede our    ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our    properties     Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to    quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to    changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No    assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for    any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons.    Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance    of our investments could adversely affect our financial    condition and results of operations. Risk    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds     From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master    leases or similar financial support arrangements. We must    re-invest these proceeds, on a timely basis, in properties or in    qualified short-term investments. We compete for real estate    investments with a broad variety of potential investors. This    competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our    ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us.    Delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues    and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders. Failure    to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our    management or increase our expenses     We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively    short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in    the future. Our rapid growth has resulted in increased levels of    responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions    could place significant additional demands on, and require us to    expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure to    manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business    and, in particular, our financial condition, results of    operations and cash flows, which could negatively affect our    ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our rapid growth    could also increase our capital requirements, which may require    us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur    additional debt. We    might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a    REIT     We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code    and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a    manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious    tax consequences that will    30Table of Contents    substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our    obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of    the years involved because:           we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to    stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be    subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;           we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and    possibly increased state and local taxes; and           unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we    could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which we were disqualified.     Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of    federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the    amount we could distribute to our stockholders. Also, if we were    not a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions to    stockholders since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends    to stockholders amounting to at least the sum of (1) 85% of    our REIT ordinary income for the year, (2) 95% of our REIT    capital gain income for such year (other than capital gain that    we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (3) any    undistributed taxable income from preceding periods. See    Item 1  Business  Federal    Income Tax Considerations for a discussion of the    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that apply to us and the    effects of non-qualification.     In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions    to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the    extent of our current and accumulated earning and profits,    although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the    dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be    eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to    long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%)    with respect to distributions.     As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a    REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business    strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common    stock.     Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly    technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which    there are only limited judicial and administrative    interpretations. The determination of various factual matters    and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our    ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that    we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue    to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax Considerations    included in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K. The    90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity    and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial    transactions     To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to    REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make    distributions to our stockholders. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation  Federal Income Tax    Considerations  Qualification as a REIT     Annual Distribution Requirements included in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient    cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT    distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to    time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to    meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain    cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to    avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due to the timing    differences between the actual receipt of income and actual    payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the    inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in    arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition,    non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or    repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash    deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or    liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution    requirement. In the event that timing differences occur or we    deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue    additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that    we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if    possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a    transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution    requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to    meet our obligations. Other    risk factors     We are also subject to other risks. First, our Second Restated    Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws    contain anti-takeover provisions (staggered board provisions,    restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority    stockholder approval requirements for business combinations)    that could make it    31Table of Contents    more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring    us without the approval of our incumbent Board of Directors.    Provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover    attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.     Additionally, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we    have entered into employment agreements with our executive    officers, losing any one of them could, at least temporarily,    have an adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing    more than one would have a material adverse impact on our    business. "

     This Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements    that constitute forward-looking statements as that    term is defined in the federal securities laws. These    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,    those regarding:           the possible expansion of our portfolio;           the sale of properties;           the performance of our operators/tenants and properties;           our ability to enter into agreements with new viable tenants for    properties that we take back from financially troubled tenants,    if any;           our ability to retain or increase occupancies in our medical    office buildings at similar or higher rates;           our ability to make distributions to stockholders;           our policies and plans regarding investments, financings and    other matters;           our tax status as a real estate investment trust;           our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity;           our ability to access capital markets or other sources of    funds; and           our ability to meet our earnings guidance.     When we use words such as may, will,    intend, should, believe,    expect, anticipate, estimate    or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking    statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of    26Table of Contents    future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Our    expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may    differ materially from our expectations. This may be a result of    various factors, including, but not limited to:           the status of the economy;           the status of capital markets, including prevailing interest    rates;           issues facing the health care industry, including compliance    with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies and    operators/tenants difficulty in cost-effectively    obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;           changes in financing terms;           competition within the health care and senior housing industries;           negative developments in the operating results or financial    condition of operators, including, but not limited to, their    ability to pay rent and repay loans;           our ability to transition or sell facilities with profitable    results;           the failure to make new investments as and when anticipated;           the failure of closings to occur as and when anticipated;           acts of God affecting our properties;           our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies    occur;           our ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to    assets sold;           operator bankruptcies or insolvencies;           government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid    reimbursement rates;           liability or contract claims by or against operators;           unanticipated difficulties    and/or    expenditures relating to future acquisitions;           environmental laws affecting our properties;           changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting;           other legal and operational factors, including REIT    qualification and key management personnel recruitment and    retention; and           the risks described below: Risk    factors related to our operators revenues and    expenses     Our investment property operators revenues are primarily    driven by occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if    applicable, and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities    are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities,    taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from    government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under    pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls.    Liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for    our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues    and/or any    increase in operating expenses result in a property not    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be    relied upon. Risk    factors related to obligor bankruptcies     We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,    which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that    an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency    proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease    agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand    immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our    loans    27Table of Contents    provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation,    demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest,    foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the    bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party    that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An obligor in    bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to    limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of    a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case    of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies.     We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment    property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property    and/or    transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we    have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property    to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided    working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new    obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new    tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may    expose us to certain successor liabilities. Should such events    occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely    affected. Transfers    of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and    these facilities may not have efficient alternative    uses     Transfers of health care facilities to successor operators may    be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for    transfers of other types of real estate. The replacement of an    operator could be delayed by the approval process of any    federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the    facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage    the facility. Alternatively, given the specialized nature of our    facilities, we may be required to spend substantial time and    funds to adapt these properties to other uses. If we are unable    to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find    efficient alternative uses, our revenue and operations may be    adversely affected. Risk    factors related to government regulations     Our obligors businesses are affected by government    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that an    operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues    from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries, government    funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to    specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due    to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such    property. In recent years, governmental payors have frozen or    reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary    pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be    of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We    cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect    any future legislative reforms may have on the financial    condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no    assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be    available for services provided by any property operator,    whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare,    Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of    services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could    have a material adverse effect on an obligors liquidity,    financial condition and results of operations, which could    adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its    obligations to us. See Item 1     Business  Certain Government Regulations     Reimbursement above.     Our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive    federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection    laws and regulations. Our operators or tenants    failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of    accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines,    suspension or decertification from federal and state health care    programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. Such    actions may have an effect on our operators or    tenants ability to make lease payments to us and,    therefore, adversely impact us.     Many of our medical properties may require a license    and/or    certificate of need to operate. Failure to obtain a license or    certificate of need, or loss of a required license or    certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in    the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events    could materially adversely affect our operators or    tenants ability to make rent payments to us. State and    local laws also may regulate expansion, including the addition    of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and    the construction of health care facilities, by requiring a    certificate of need or other similar approval.    28Table of Contents Risk    factors related to liability claims and insurance    costs     Long-term care property operators (skilled nursing facilities,    assisted living facilities, and independent living/continuing    care retirement communities) have experienced substantial    increases in both the number and size of patient care liability    claims in recent years, particularly in the states of Texas and    Florida. As a result, general and professional liability costs    have increased and may continue to increase. Long-term care    liability insurance rates are increasing nationwide because of    large jury awards. Over the past four years, both Texas and    Florida have adopted skilled nursing property liability laws    that modify or limit tort damages. Despite some of these    reforms, the long-term care industry overall continues to    experience very high general and professional liability costs.    Insurance companies have responded to this claims crisis by    severely restricting their capacity to write long-term care    general and professional liability policies. No assurances can    be given that the climate for long-term care general and    professional liability insurance will improve in any of the    foregoing states or any other states where the property    operators conduct business. Insurance companies may continue to    reduce or stop writing general and professional liability    policies for long-term care facilities. Thus, general and    professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or    very costly, which may adversely affect the property    operators future operations, cash flows and financial    condition, and may have a material adverse effect on the    property operators ability to meet their obligations to us. Risk    factors related to acquisitions     We are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired    properties, including contingent liabilities, and newly acquired    properties might require significant management attention that    would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree    to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the    project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure    completion of the project. Moreover, if we issue equity    securities or incur additional debt, or both, to finance future    acquisitions, it may reduce our per share financial results.    These costs may negatively affect our results of operations. Risk    factors related to environmental laws     Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of    real estate may be required to respond to the presence or    release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held    liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that    result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous    substances. We may become liable to reimburse the government for    damages and costs it incurs in connection with the    contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person    based on the persons relationship to the property. Our    tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition    of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site    assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to    taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to    meet the all appropriate inquiry standard, which we    believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if    environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we    do not believe that any of our properties are subject to    material environmental contamination. However, environmental    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material    adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the    business or financial condition of our obligors. Risk    factors related to facilities that require entrance    fees     Certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of    an upfront entrance fee by the resident, a portion of which may    be refundable by the operator. Some of these facilities are    subject to substantial oversight by state regulators. As a    result of this oversight, residents of these facilities may have    a variety of rights, including, for example, the right to cancel    their contracts within a specified period of time and certain    lien rights. The oversight and rights of residents within these    facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of    the operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively    impact us.    29Table of Contents Risk    factors related to facilities under construction or    development     At any given time, we may be in the process of constructing one    or more new facilities that ultimately will require a license    before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended    use. The operator also will need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid    provider agreements or third party payor contracts. In the event    that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure,    provider agreements on contracts  after the completion of    construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn    any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator    obtains a license to operate the new facility and the necessary    provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract    with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate    the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider    agreements or contracts.     In connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development    and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain,    or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use,    building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and    authorizations. These factors could result in increased costs or    our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may not be    able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us    unable to proceed with our development activities, and we may    not be able to complete construction and    lease-up of    a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt    service expense or construction costs.     Additionally, the time frame required for development,    construction and    lease-up of    these properties means that we may have to wait years for    significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash    distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from    operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to    borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly    developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow    that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall    financial performance.     In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property,    we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of    that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our    investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. If our    financial projections with respect to a new property are    inaccurate, and the property is unable to achieve the expected    occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we    expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs    of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove    to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our    profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties    not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may    be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service    associated with that property. We do    not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases, and if    they do not, we may be unable to lease the properties on as    favorable terms, or at all     We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases    at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times    through 2021. If these leases are not renewed, we would be    required to find other tenants to occupy those properties. There    can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable    replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on    terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would    be able to lease those properties at all. Our    ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the    loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground    leases     We have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by    acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the    building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in    the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases.    As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the    possibility of losing the property upon termination of the    ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.    30Table of Contents Illiquidity    of real estate investments could significantly impede our    ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our    properties     Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to    quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to    changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No    assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for    any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons.    Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance    of our investments could adversely affect our financial    condition and results of operations. Risk    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds     From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master    leases or similar financial support arrangements. We must    re-invest these proceeds, on a timely basis, in properties or in    qualified short-term investments. We compete for real estate    investments with a broad variety of potential investors. This    competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our    ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us.    Delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues    and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders. Failure    to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our    management or increase our expenses     We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively    short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in    the future. Our rapid growth has resulted in increased levels of    responsibility for our management. Future property acquisitions    could place significant additional demands on, and require us to    expand, our management, resources and personnel. Our failure to    manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business    and, in particular, our financial condition, results of    operations and cash flows, which could negatively affect our    ability to make distributions to stockholders. Our rapid growth    could also increase our capital requirements, which may require    us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur    additional debt. Other    risk factors     We are also subject to a number of other risks. First, we might    fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. We intend to    operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe we    have and will continue to operate in such a manner. Since REIT    qualification requires us to meet a number of complex    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of    federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the    amount we could distribute to our stockholders. Also, if we were    not a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions to    stockholders since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends    to stockholders amounting to at least the sum of (1) 85% of our    REIT ordinary income for such year (other than capital gain that    we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (2) any undistributed    taxable income from preceding periods. See    Item 1  Business     Taxation for a discussion of the provisions of the    Internal Revenue Code that apply to us and the effects of    non-qualification.     Second, our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and    Amended and Restated By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions    (staggered board provisions, restrictions on share ownership and    transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements    for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for    or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the    approval of our incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and    agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could    reduce the market value of our common stock.     Third, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we have    entered into employment agreements with our executive officers,    losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an    adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more    than one would have a material adverse impact on our business.    31Table of Contents "

This    may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited    to:           the status of the economy;           the status of capital markets, including prevailing interest    rates;           serious issues facing the health care industry, including    compliance with, and changes to, regulations and payment    policies and operators difficulty in obtaining and    maintaining adequate liability and other insurance;           changes in financing terms;           competition within the health care and senior housing industries;           negative developments in the operating results or financial    condition of operators, including, but not limited to, their    ability to pay rent and repay loans;           the Companys ability to transition or sell facilities with    profitable results;           the failure of closings to occur as and when anticipated;           acts of God affecting our properties;           our ability to reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to assets    sold;           operator bankruptcies or insolvencies;           government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid    reimbursement rates;           liability claims and insurance costs for our operators;           unanticipated difficulties    and/or    expenditures relating to future acquisitions;           environmental laws affecting our properties;           delays in reinvestment of sale proceeds;           changes in rules or practices governing the Companys    financial reporting;           other factors, including REIT qualification, anti-takeover    provisions and key management personnel; and           the risks described below: Risk    factors related to our operators revenues and    expenses     Our facility operators revenues are primarily driven by    occupancy, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable,    and private pay rates. Expenses for these facilities are    primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes,    insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government    reimbursement have, and may continue, to come under pressure due    to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Liability    insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our    operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues    and/or any    increase in operating expenses result in a facility not    generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our    operator and the value of other collateral would have to be    relied upon.    26Table of ContentsRisk    factors related to operator bankruptcies     We are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to    meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us,    which may result in an operator bankruptcy or insolvency, or    that an operator might become subject to bankruptcy or    insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating    lease agreements provide us with the right to evict an operator,    demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies,    and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding    obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid    interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other    remedies, the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party    that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. An operator in    bankruptcy may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect    unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid    principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise    other rights and remedies.     We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate    taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of a facility,    avoid the imposition of liens on a facility    and/or    transition a facility to a new operator. In some instances, we    have terminated our lease with an operator and relet the    facility to another operator. In some of those situations, we    have provided working capital loans to and limited    indemnification of the new operator. If we cannot transition a    leased facility to a new operator, we may take possession of    that facility, which may expose us to certain successor    liabilities. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating    cash flow may be adversely affected. Risk    factors related to government regulations     Our operators businesses are affected by government    reimbursement and private payor rates. To the extent that a    facility receives a significant portion of its revenues from    governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such    revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes,    retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments    or set-offs, administrative rulings, policy interpretations,    payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries, government    funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to    specific facilities) and interruption or delays in payments due    to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such    facility. In recent years, governmental payors have frozen or    reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary    pressures. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be    of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We    cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect    any future legislative reforms may have on the financial    condition of the skilled nursing industry, the specialty care    industry or the health care industry in general. There can be no    assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be    available for services provided by any facility operator,    whether the facility receives reimbursement from Medicare,    Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of    services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could    have a material adverse effect on an operators liquidity,    financial condition and results of operations, which could    adversely affect the ability of an operator to meet its    obligations to us. In addition, the replacement of an operator    that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the    approval process of any federal, state or local agency necessary    for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the    operator licensed to manage the facility. See    Item 1  Business  Certain    Government Regulations  Reimbursement    above. Risk    factors related to liability claims and insurance    costs     Long-term care facility operators (skilled nursing facilities,    assisted living facilities, and independent living/continuing    care retirement communities) have experienced substantial    increases in both the number and size of patient care liability    claims in recent years, particularly in the states of Texas and    Florida. As a result, general and professional liability costs    have increased and may continue to increase. Long-term care    liability insurance rates are increasing nationwide because of    large jury awards in states like Texas and Florida. Over the    past four years, both Texas and Florida have adopted skilled    nursing facility liability laws that modify or limit tort    damages. Despite some of these reforms, the long-term care    industry overall continues to experience very high general and    professional liability costs. Insurance companies have responded    to this claims crisis by severely restricting their capacity to    write long-term care general and professional liability    policies. No assurances can be given that the climate for    long-term care general and professional liability insurance will    improve in any of the foregoing states or any other states where    the facility operators conduct business. Insurance companies may    continue to reduce or stop writing general and professional    liability policies for long-term care facilities. Thus, general    professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or    very costly, which may adversely affect the facility    operators future    27Table of Contents    operations, cash flows and financial condition, and may have a    material adverse effect on the facility operators ability    to meet their obligations to us. Risk    factors related to acquisitions     We are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not    prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated    difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired    properties, including contingent liabilities, and newly acquired    properties might require significant management attention that    would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree    to provide construction funding to an operator and the project    is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion    of the project or we could lose the property. Moreover, if we    issue equity securities or incur additional debt, or both, to    finance future acquisitions, it may reduce our per share    financial results. These costs may negatively affect our results    of operations. Risk    factors related to environmental laws     Under various federal and state laws, owners or operators of    real estate may be required to respond to the release of    hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for    property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from    environmental contamination. These laws also expose us to the    possibility that we may become liable to reimburse the    government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with    the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a    person based on the persons relationship to the property.    Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the    condition of the property and since we are a passive landlord,    we do not participate in the management of any    property in which we have an interest. Moreover, we review    environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or    encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments    are designed to meet the all appropriate inquiry    standard, which qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense    if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments,    we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to    material environmental contamination. However, environmental    liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur    costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material    adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Risk    factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds     From time to time, we will have cash available from (1) the    proceeds of sales of our securities, (2) principal payments    on our loans receivable and (3) the sale of properties,    including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master    leases or similar financial support arrangements. We must    re-invest these proceeds, on a timely basis, in properties or in    qualified short-term investments. We compete for real estate    investments with a broad variety of potential investors. This    competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our    ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us.    Delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues    and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders. Other    risk factors     We are also subject to a number of other risks. First, we might    fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. We intend to    operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe we    have and will continue to operate in such a manner. Since REIT    qualification requires us to meet a number of complex    requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them,    and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of    federal taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the    amount we could distribute to our stockholders. Also, if we were    not a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions to    stockholders since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends    to stockholders amounting to at least 90% of its annual taxable    income (including 100% of capital gains). See    Item 1  Business  Taxation    for a discussion of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code    that apply to us and the effects of non-qualification.     Second, our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and    Amended and Restated By-Laws contain anti-takeover provisions    (staggered board provisions, restrictions on share ownership and    transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements    for business combinations) that could make it more difficult for    or even prevent    28Table of Contents    a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our    incumbent Board of Directors. Provisions and agreements that    inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market    value of our common stock.     Third, we are dependent on key personnel. Although we have    entered into employment agreements with our executive officers,    losing any one of them could, at least temporarily, have an    adverse impact on our operations. We believe that losing more    than one would have a material adverse impact on our business. "
