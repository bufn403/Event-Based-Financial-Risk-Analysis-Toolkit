RISK FACTORS.Risks Related to Our Distribution StructureOur failure to continue to attract new recruits, retain sales representatives or license or maintain the licensing of our sales representatives would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.New sales representatives provide us with access to new clients, enable us to increase sales and provide the next generation of successful sales representatives. As is typical with distribution businesses, we experience a high rate of turnover among our part-time sales representatives, which requires us to attract, retain and motivate a large number of sales representatives. Recruiting is performed by our current sales representatives, and the effectiveness of our recruiting  20Table of Contentsis generally dependent upon our reputation as a provider of a rewarding and potentially lucrative income opportunity, as well as the general competitive and economic environment. Whether recruits are motivated to complete their training and licensing requirements and to commit to selling our products is largely dependent upon the effectiveness of our compensation and promotional programs and the competitiveness of such programs compared with other companies, including other part-time business opportunities.If our new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient interest to attract new recruits, motivate them to become licensed sales representatives and maintain their licenses and incentivize them to sell our products and recruit other new sales representatives, our business would be materially adversely affected.Furthermore, if we or any other businesses with a similar distribution structure engage in practices resulting in increased negative public attention for our business model, the resulting reputational challenges could adversely affect our ability to attract new recruits. Companies such as ours that use independent agents to sell directly to customers can be the subject of negative commentary on website postings, social media and other non-traditional media. This negative commentary can spread inaccurate or incomplete information about distribution companies in general or our company in particular, which can make our recruiting more difficult.From time to time, various jurisdictions make changes to the state or provincial licensing examination process that may make it more difficult for our sales representatives to obtain their life insurance licenses. The Canadian Insurance Services Regulatory Organizations (“CISRO”) is developing a new unified provincial life insurance licensing examination program to be implemented in early 2016 that could significantly increase the cost, time and difficulty for our agents to obtain their life insurance licenses in Canada. If CISRO’s new licensing system is implemented as currently described, it could ultimately result in a decline in the number of our licensed representatives in Canada and our business could be materially adversely affected.Certain of our key RVPs have large sales organizations that include thousands of downline sales representatives. These key RVPs are responsible for attracting, motivating, supporting and assisting the sales representatives in their sales organizations. The loss of one or more key RVPs together with a substantial number of their sales representatives for any reason could materially adversely affect our financial results and could impair our ability to attract new sales representatives.There are a number of laws and regulations that could apply to our distribution model, which subject us to the risk that we may have to modify our distribution structure.In the past, certain distribution models that use independent agents to sell directly to customers have been subject to challenge under various laws, including laws relating to business opportunities, franchising and unfair or deceptive trade practices.In general, state business opportunity and franchise laws in the United States prohibit sales of business opportunities or franchises unless the seller provides potential purchasers with a pre-sale disclosure document that has first been filed with a designated state agency and grants purchasers certain legal recourse against sellers of business opportunities and franchises. In Canada, the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have enacted legislation dealing with franchising, which typically requires mandatory disclosure to prospective franchisees.We have not been, and are not currently, subject to business opportunity laws because the amounts paid by our new representatives to us: (i) are less than the minimum thresholds set by many state statutes and (ii) are not fees paid for the right to participate in a business, but rather are for bona fide expenses such as state-required insurance examinations and pre-licensing training. We have not been, and are not currently, subject to franchise laws for similar reasons. However, there is a risk that a governmental agency or court could disagree with our assessment or that these laws and regulations could change. In addition, although we do not believe that the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"")'s Business Opportunity Rule applies to our company, it could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Becoming subject to business opportunity or franchise laws or regulations could require us to provide certain disclosures and regulate the manner in which we recruit our sales representatives that may increase the expense of, or adversely impact our success in, recruiting new sales representatives and make it more difficult for us to successfully attract and recruit new sales representatives.There are various laws and regulations that prohibit fraudulent or deceptive schemes known as pyramid schemes. In general, a pyramid scheme is defined as an arrangement in which new participants are required to pay a fee to participate in the organization and then receive compensation primarily for recruiting other persons to participate, either directly or through sales of goods or services that are merely disguised payments for recruiting others. The application of these laws and regulations to a given set of business practices is inherently fact-based and, therefore, is subject to interpretation by applicable enforcement authorities. Our sales representatives are paid commissions based on sales of our products and services to bona fide purchasers, and for this and other reasons we do not believe that we are subject to laws regulating  21Table of Contentspyramid schemes. Moreover, our sales representatives are not required to purchase any of the products marketed by us. However, even though we believe that our distribution practices are currently in compliance with, or exempt from, these laws and regulations, there is a risk that a governmental agency or court could disagree with our assessment or that these laws and regulations could change, which may require us to cease our operations in certain jurisdictions or result in other costs or fines.There are also federal, state and provincial laws of general application, such as the FTC Act, and state or provincial unfair and deceptive trade practices laws that could potentially be invoked to challenge aspects of our recruiting of sales representatives and compensation practices. In particular, our recruiting efforts include promotional materials for recruits that describe the potential opportunity available to them if they join our sales force. These materials, as well as our other recruiting efforts and those of our sales representatives, are subject to scrutiny by the FTC and state and provincial enforcement authorities with respect to misleading statements, including misleading earnings claims made to convince potential new recruits to join our sales force. If claims made by us or by our sales representatives are deemed to be misleading, it could result in violations of the FTC Act or comparable state and provincial statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices or result in reputational harm.Being subject to, or out of compliance with, the aforementioned laws and regulations could require us to change our distribution structure, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Regulators could adopt laws or interpret existing laws in a way that would require retroactive changes to our business, accounting practices, or redundant reserve financing structure. Any such retroactive changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of our sales representatives is successfully challenged.Our sales representatives are independent contractors who operate their own businesses. In the past, we have been successful in defending our company in various contexts before courts and governmental agencies against claims that our sales representatives should be treated like employees. Although we believe that we have properly classified our representatives as independent contractors, there is nevertheless a risk that the IRS or another authority will take a different view. Furthermore, the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact-sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent sales representatives are subject to change or interpretation by various authorities.The classification of workers as independent contractors has been the subject of federal legislative and regulatory interest over the last several years, with proposals being made that call for greater scrutiny of independent contractor classifications and greater penalties for companies who wrongly classify workers as independent contractors instead of employees. Thus far, none of these proposals has been enacted by the federal government. In 2012, the DOL reiterated its intention first communicated in 2010 to gather information and pursue rulemaking under the Fair Labor Standards Act referred to as “Right to Know”. If rules are adopted, companies such as Primerica that utilize independent contractors may be required to give each potential independent contractor information about that status, including how the classification was determined, an individual's rights to challenge his or her classification and disclosures of all of the possible downsides (such as lack of benefits and lack of pay protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act) of being categorized as an independent contractor. Several states are considering similar efforts. We cannot predict the outcome of these legislative and regulatory efforts, but we expect the topic of independent contractor classification to remain active.If a federal, state or provincial authority enacts legislation or adopts regulations that change the manner in which employees and independent contractors are classified or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws and regulations, including in respect of tax withholding, social security payments and recordkeeping, or we may be required to modify our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with federal, state, or provincial tax or employment laws or with respect to any applicable employee benefit plan.The Company or its independent sales representatives' violation of, or non-compliance with, laws and regulations and the related claims and proceedings could expose us to material liabilities.Extensive federal, state, provincial and territorial laws regulate our products and our relationships with our clients, imposing certain requirements that our sales representatives must follow. At any given time, we may have pending state, federal or provincial examinations or inquiries of our investment and savings products and insurance businesses. In  22Table of Contentsaddition to imposing requirements that sales representatives must follow in their dealings with clients, these laws and regulations generally require us to maintain a system of supervision to attempt to ensure that our sales representatives comply with the requirements to which they are subject. We have developed policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations. However, despite these compliance and supervisory efforts, the breadth of our operations and the broad regulatory requirements could result in oversight failures and instances of non-compliance or misconduct on the part of our sales representatives.From time to time, we are subject to private litigation as a result of alleged misconduct by our sales representatives. Examples include claims that a sales representative's failure to disclose underwriting-related information regarding the insured on an insurance application resulted in the denial of a life insurance policy claim, and with respect to investment and savings products sales, errors or omissions that a sales representative made in connection with an account. In addition to the potential for non-compliance with laws or misconduct applicable to our existing product offerings, we could experience similar regulatory issues or litigation with respect to new products. Non-compliance or misconduct by our sales representatives could result in adverse findings in either examinations or litigation and could subject us to sanctions, monetary liabilities, restrictions on or the loss of the operation of our business, claims against us or reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any failure to protect the confidentiality of client information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Pursuant to federal laws, various federal agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, most states and some provinces have enacted laws, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. Many of our sales representatives and employees have access to, and routinely process, personal information of clients through a variety of media, including the Internet and software applications. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, our company, our employees and our sales representatives. It is possible that a sales representative or employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if our sales representatives or employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Insurance Business and ReinsuranceWe may face significant losses if our actual experience differs from our expectations regarding mortality or persistency.We set prices for life insurance policies based upon expected claim payment patterns derived from assumptions we make about the mortality rates, or likelihood of death, of our policyholders in any given year. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual mortality rates compare to our pricing assumptions. For example, if mortality rates are higher than those assumed in our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make more death benefit payments under our life insurance policies or to make such payments sooner than we had projected, which may decrease the profitability of our term life insurance products and result in an increase in the cost of our subsequent reinsurance transactions.The prices and expected future profitability of our life insurance products are also based, in part, upon assumptions related to persistency. Actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse effect on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy. Actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse effect on profitability in the later years of a block of policies because the anticipated claims experience is higher in these later years. If actual persistency is significantly different from that assumed in our pricing assumptions, our reserves for future policy benefits may prove to be inadequate. We are precluded from adjusting premiums on our in-force business during the initial term of the policies, and our ability to adjust premiums on in-force business after the initial policy term is limited to the maximum premium rates in the policy.Our assumptions and estimates regarding mortality and persistency require us to make numerous judgments and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the actual persistency or ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claim payments on a block of policies, the timing of those payments, or whether the assets supporting these contingent future payment obligations will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of claims. If we conclude that our future policy benefit reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover actual or expected  23Table of Contentsclaims payments and the scheduled amortization of our deferred policy acquisition costs (""DAC"") assets, we would be required to first accelerate our amortization of the DAC assets and then increase our future policy benefit reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The occurrence of a catastrophic event could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events, which could cause a large number of premature deaths of our insureds. A catastrophic event could also cause significant volatility in global financial markets and disrupt the economy. Although we have ceded a significant majority of our mortality risk to reinsurers, a catastrophic event could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims resulting from a catastrophic event could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any quarter or year and could also materially harm the financial condition of our reinsurers, which would increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new business could also be adversely affected.In addition, most of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business require life insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which raise funds to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed issuers. It is possible that a catastrophic event could require extraordinary assessments on our insurance companies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance business is highly regulated, and statutory and regulatory changes may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Life insurance statutes and regulations are generally designed to protect the interests of the public and policyholders.  Those interests may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. Currently, in the United States, the power to regulate insurance resides almost exclusively with the states. The laws of the various U.S. jurisdictions grant state insurance regulators broad powers to regulate almost all aspects of our insurance business. Much of this state regulation follows model statutes or regulations developed or amended by the NAIC, which is composed of the insurance commissioners of each U.S. jurisdiction. The NAIC re-examines and amends existing model laws and regulations (including holding company regulations) in addition to determining whether new ones are needed.The U.S. Congress continues to examine the current condition of U.S. state-based insurance regulation to determine whether to impose federal regulation and to allow optional federal insurance company incorporation. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office and authorized it to, among other things, study methods to modernize and improve insurance regulation, including uniformity and the feasibility of federal regulation. We cannot predict with certainty whether, or in what form, reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will materially affect our business. Changes in federal statutes, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, financial services regulation and federal taxation, in addition to changes to state statutes and regulations, may be more restrictive than current requirements or may result in higher costs, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are currently undergoing targeted multi-state treasurer audits with respect to unclaimed property laws, and Primerica Life and NBLIC are engaged in targeted multi-state market conduct examinations with respect to their claims-paying practices. The Treasurer of the State of West Virginia brought a suit against Primerica Life and other insurance companies alleging violations of the West Virginia unclaimed property act. The suit was dismissed, and the Treasurer has appealed. Other jurisdictions may pursue similar audits examinations and litigation. The potential outcome of such actions is difficult to predict but could subject us to adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, settlement payments, additional payments to beneficiaries and additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws. We cannot predict with certainty the effect these proceedings may have on the conduct of our business, financial condition and results of operations.Provincial and federal insurance laws regulate all aspects of our Canadian insurance business. Changes to provincial or federal statutes and regulations may be more restrictive than current requirements or may result in higher costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If OSFI determines that our corporate actions do not comply with applicable Canadian law, Primerica Life Canada could face sanctions or fines, and Primerica Life Canada could be subject to increased capital requirements or other requirements deemed appropriate by OSFI.We received approval from the Minister of Finance (Canada) under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada) in connection with our indirect acquisition of Primerica Life Canada. The Minister expects that a person controlling a federal insurance company will provide ongoing financial, managerial or operational support to its subsidiary should such support prove  24Table of Contentsnecessary, and has required us to sign a support principle letter to that effect. This ongoing support may take the form of additional capital, the provision of managerial expertise or the provision of support in such areas as risk management, internal control systems and training. However, the letter does not create a legal obligation on the part of the person to provide the support. In the event that OSFI determines Primerica Life Canada is not receiving adequate support from the Parent under applicable Canadian law, Primerica Life Canada may be subject to increased capital requirements or other requirements deemed appropriate by OSFI.If there were to be extraordinary changes to statutory or regulatory requirements in the United States or Canada, we may be unable to fully comply with or maintain all required insurance licenses and approvals. Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have all requisite licenses and approvals, or do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our insurance activities or impose fines or penalties on us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation or regulatory initiatives may have on the conduct of our business.A decline in the regulatory capital ratios of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and ratings agencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to RBC standards (imposed under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of domicile). The RBC formula for U.S. life insurance companies generally establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to report their results of RBC calculations annually to the applicable state department of insurance and the NAIC. Our Canadian life insurance subsidiary is subject to minimum continuing capital and surplus requirements (“MCCSR”), and Tier 1 capital ratio requirements, and is required to provide its MCCSR and Tier 1 capital ratio calculations to the Canadian regulators. The capitalization of our insurance subsidiaries is maintained at levels in excess of the effective minimum requirements of the NAIC in the United States and OSFI in Canada. In any particular year, statutory capital and surplus amounts and RBC and MCCSR ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which is sensitive to equity and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in their reserve requirements, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in their investment portfolios, the credit ratings of investments held in their portfolios, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates, credit market volatility, changes in consumer behavior, as well as changes to the NAIC's RBC formula or the MCCSR calculation of OSFI. Many of these factors are outside of our control.Our financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC and MCCSR ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. Ratings agencies may change their internal models, effectively increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to maintain their current ratings. In addition, ratings agencies may downgrade the invested assets held in our portfolio, which could result in a reduction of their capital and surplus. Changes in statutory accounting principles could also adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries' ability to meet minimum RBC, MCCSR and statutory capital and surplus requirements. There is no assurance that our insurance subsidiaries will not need additional capital or, if needed, that we will be able to provide it to maintain the targeted RBC and MCCSR levels to support their business operations.The failure of any of our insurance subsidiaries to meet its applicable RBC and MCCSR requirements or minimum capital and surplus requirements could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed by insurance regulators, including limitations on its ability to write additional business, supervision by regulators or seizure or liquidation. Any corrective action imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A decline in RBC or MCCSR also limits the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions and could be a factor in causing ratings agencies to downgrade the financial strength ratings of all our insurance subsidiaries. Such downgrades would have an adverse effect on our ability to write new insurance business and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to redeploy capital through reserve financing transactions.From time to time, management considers methods for the deployment of capital, including through the use of redundant reserve financing transactions. Certain state regulators, as well as the NAIC, have been reviewing the use of captive insurance companies for the purpose of redundant reserve financing transactions, and it is uncertain whether state regulators will continue to approve such transactions going forward. Management currently intends to pursue a redundant reserve financing transaction for Primerica Life in 2014. However, there is a possibility that state regulators will not  25Table of Contentsapprove such a transaction and, as a result, Primerica Life may not be able to redeploy capital to the Parent Company through reserve financing transactions.A ratings downgrade by a ratings organization could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Each of our insurance subsidiaries, with the exception of Peach Re, has been assigned a financial strength rating by A.M. Best. Primerica Life currently also has an insurer financial strength rating from Standard & Poor's and Moody's. NBLIC, Primerica Life Canada, and Peach Re are not rated by Standard & Poor's and Moody's.The financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic review using, among other things, the ratings agencies' proprietary capital adequacy models, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and are not intended for the protection of stockholders or as a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities. Our financial strength ratings will affect our competitive position relative to other insurance companies. If the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries fall below certain levels, some of our policyholders may move their business to our competitors. In addition, the models used by ratings agencies to determine financial strength are different from the capital requirements set by insurance regulators.Ratings organizations review the financial performance and financial conditions of insurance companies, and provide opinions regarding financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders. A downgrade in the financial strength ratings of any of our insurance subsidiaries, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations by, among other things:•reducing sales of insurance products;•adversely affecting our relationships with our sales representatives;•materially increasing the amount of policy cancellations by our policyholders;•requiring us to reduce prices to remain competitive; and•adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all.If the rating agencies or regulators change their approach to financial strength ratings and statutory capital requirements, we may need to take action to maintain current ratings and capital adequacy ratios, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, the Parent Company currently has investment grade credit ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and A.M. Best for its senior unsecured debt. These ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations and are important factors in its ability to access liquidity in the debt markets. A rating downgrade by a rating agency can occur at any time if the rating agency perceives an adverse change in our financial condition, results of operations or ability to service debt. If such a downgrade occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including adversely limiting our access to capital in the unsecured debt market and potentially increasing the cost of such debt.Credit deterioration in, and the effects of interest rate fluctuations on, our invested asset portfolio could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.A large percentage of our invested asset portfolio is invested in fixed-income securities. As a result, credit deterioration and interest rate fluctuations could materially affect the value and earnings of our invested asset portfolio. Fixed-income securities decline in value if there is no active trading market for the securities or the market's impression of, or the ratings agencies' views on, the credit quality of an issuer worsens. During periods of declining market interest rates, any interest income we receive on variable interest rate investments would decrease, and we would be forced to invest the cash we receive as interest, return of principal on our investments and cash from operations in lower-yielding, high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of fixed-income securities could also decide to prepay their obligations to borrow at lower market rates, which would increase our reinvestment risk. If interest rates generally increase, the market value of our fixed rate income portfolio decreases. Additionally, if the market value of any security in our invested asset portfolio decreases, we may realize losses if we deem the value of the security to be other-than-temporarily impaired. To the extent that any fluctuations in fair value or interest rates are significant or we recognize impairments that are material, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 26Table of ContentsValuation of our investments and the determination of whether a decline in the fair value of our invested assets is other-than-temporary are based on estimates that may prove to be incorrect.U.S. GAAP requires that when the fair value of any of our invested assets declines and such decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we recognize a loss in either accumulated other comprehensive income or on our statement of income based on certain criteria in the period that such determination is made. Determining the fair value of certain invested assets, particularly those that do not trade on a regular basis, requires an assessment of available data and the use of assumptions and estimates. Once it is determined that the fair value of an asset is below its carrying value, we must determine whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which is based on subjective factors and involves a variety of assumptions and estimates.There are certain risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in market value are other-than-temporary. These include significant changes in general economic conditions and business markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and assumptions and legislative actions. In the case of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, there is added uncertainty as to the performance of the underlying collateral assets. To the extent that we are incorrect in our determination of the fair value of our investment securities or our determination that a decline in their value is other-than-temporary, we may realize losses that never actually materialize or may fail to recognize losses within the appropriate reporting period.The failure by any of our reinsurers to perform its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We extensively use reinsurance in the United States to diversify our risk and to manage our loss exposure to mortality risk. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. We, as the insurer, are required to pay the full amount of death benefits even in circumstances where we are entitled to receive payments from the reinsurer. Due to factors such as insolvency, adverse underwriting results or inadequate investment returns, our reinsurers may not be able to pay the amounts they owe us on a timely basis or at all. Further, reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them or might delay payment. Since death benefit claims may be paid long after a policy is issued, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we can recover amounts to which we are entitled. Any such failure to pay by our reinsurers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The failure by the affiliates of Citigroup who are parties to the Citigroup reinsurance transactions to perform their obligations to us under our coinsurance agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Immediately prior to the IPO, we entered into four coinsurance agreements with three reinsurer affiliates of Citigroup pursuant to which we ceded between 80% and 90% of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year-end 2009. Under this arrangement, our current third-party reinsurance agreements remain in place. The largest of these transactions involved two coinsurance agreements between Primerica Life and Prime Reinsurance Company, Inc. (""Prime Re""), then a wholly owned subsidiary of Primerica Life. Pursuant to these reinsurance agreements, we distributed to Citigroup all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Prime Re. Prime Re was formed solely for the purpose of entering into these reinsurance transactions, had no operating history at the time the coinsurance agreements were executed and does not possess a financial strength rating from any rating agency. The other transactions were between (i) Primerica Life Canada and Financial Reassurance Company 2010 Ltd., a Bermuda reinsurer and wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, formed to operate solely for the purpose of reinsuring Citigroup-related risks and (ii) NBLIC and American Health and Life Insurance Company (“AHL”), a wholly owned insurance subsidiary of Citigroup that is rated by A.M. Best. Each of the three reinsurers entered into trust agreements with our respective insurance subsidiaries and a trustee pursuant to which the reinsurer placed assets (primarily treasury and fixed-income securities) in trust for such subsidiary's benefit to secure the reinsurer's obligations to such subsidiary. Each such coinsurance agreement requires each reinsurer to maintain assets in trust sufficient to give the subsidiary full credit for regulatory purposes for the insurance, which amount will not be less than the amount of the reserves for the reinsured liabilities. In addition, in the case of the reinsurance transactions between Prime Re and Primerica Life, Citigroup has agreed in a capital maintenance agreement to maintain Prime Re's RBC above a specified minimum level, subject to a maximum amount being contributed by Citigroup. In the case of the reinsurance transaction between NBLIC and AHL, Citigroup has agreed to over-collateralize the assets in the trust for NBLIC for the life of the coinsurance agreement between NBLIC and AHL. Furthermore, our insurance subsidiaries have the right to recapture the business upon the occurrence of an event of default under their respective coinsurance agreement with the Citigroup affiliates subject to any applicable cure periods. While any such recapture would be at no cost to us, such recapture would result in a substantial increase in our insurance exposure and require us to be fully responsible for the management of the assets set aside to  27Table of Contentssupport statutory reserves. The type of assets we might obtain as a result of a recapture may not be as liquid as our current invested asset portfolio and could result in an unfavorable impact on our risk profile.There is no assurance that the relevant Citigroup reinsurer will pay the reinsurance obligations owed to us now or in the future or that it will pay these obligations on a timely basis. Notwithstanding the capital maintenance agreement between Prime Re and Citigroup and the initial over-collateralization of assets in trust for the benefit of our insurance companies, if any of the Citigroup reinsurers becomes insolvent, the amount in the trust account to support the obligations of such reinsurer is insufficient to pay such reinsurer's obligations to us and we fail to enforce our right to recapture the business, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Investments and Savings Products BusinessOur investment and savings products segment is heavily dependent on mutual fund and annuity products offered by a relatively small number of companies, and, if these products fail to remain competitive with other investment options or we lose our relationship with one or more of these fund companies or with the source of our annuity products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.We earn a significant portion of our earnings through our relationships with a small group of mutual fund and annuity companies. A decision by one or more of these companies to alter or discontinue their current arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any of our investment and savings products fail to achieve satisfactory investment performance, our clients may seek higher yielding alternative investment products, and we could experience higher redemption rates.In recent years there has been an increase in the popularity of alternative investments, which we do not currently offer, principally index funds and exchange traded funds. These investment options typically have low fee structures and provide some of the attributes of mutual funds, such as risk diversification. If these products continue to gain traction among our client base as viable alternatives to mutual fund investments, our investment and savings products revenues could decline.In addition to sales commissions and asset-based compensation, a portion of our earnings from investment and savings products comes from recordkeeping services that we provide to third parties and from fees earned for custodial services that we provide to clients with retirement plan accounts in the funds of these mutual fund companies. We also receive revenue sharing payments from each of these mutual fund companies. A decision by one or more of these fund companies to alter or discontinue their current arrangements with us would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company or its securities-licensed sales representatives' violations of, or non-compliance with, laws and regulations could expose us to material liabilities.Our subsidiary broker-dealer and registered investment advisor, PFS Investments, is subject to federal and state regulation of its securities business. These regulations cover sales practices, trade suitability, supervision of registered representatives, recordkeeping, the conduct and qualification of officers and employees, the rules and regulations of the MSRB and state blue sky regulation. Investment advisory representatives are generally held to a higher standard of conduct than registered representatives. Our subsidiary, PSS, is a registered transfer agent engaged in the recordkeeping business and is subject to SEC regulation. Violations of laws or regulations applicable to the activities of PFS Investments or PSS, or violations by a third party with which PFS Investments or PSS contracts which improperly performs its task, could subject us to disciplinary actions and could result in the imposition of cease and desist orders, fines or censures, restitution to clients, disciplinary actions (including the potential suspension or revocation of its license by the SEC, or the suspension or expulsion from FINRA), and reputational damage, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our Canadian dealer subsidiary, PFSL Investments Canada and its sales representatives are subject to the securities laws of the provinces and territories of Canada in which we sell our mutual fund products and those of third parties and to the rules of the MFDA, the self-regulatory organization governing mutual fund dealers. PFSL Investments Canada is subject to periodic review by both the MFDA and the provincial and territorial securities commissions to assess its compliance with, among other things, applicable capital requirements and sales practices and procedures. These regulators have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business for failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations. Possible sanctions that could be imposed include the suspension of individual sales representatives, limitations on the activities in which the dealer may engage, suspension or revocation of  28Table of Contentsthe dealer registration, censure or fines, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If heightened standards of conduct or more stringent licensing requirements, such as those proposed by the SEC and proposed and withdrawn by the DOL, are imposed on us or our sales representatives or selling compensation is reduced as a result of new legislation or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our U.S. sales representatives are subject to federal and state regulation as well as state licensing requirements. PFS Investments, which is regulated as a broker-dealer, and our U.S. sales representatives are currently subject to general anti-fraud limitations under the Exchange Act and SEC rules and regulations, as well as other conduct standards prescribed by FINRA. These standards generally require that broker-dealers and their sales representatives disclose conflicts of interest that might affect the advice or recommendations they provide and require them to make suitable investment recommendations to their customers. In January 2011 under the authority of the Dodd-Frank Act, which gives the SEC the power to impose on broker-dealers a heightened standard of conduct that is currently applicable only to investment advisers, the SEC staff submitted a report to Congress in which it recommended that the SEC adopt a fiduciary standard of conduct for broker-dealers that is uniform with that of investment advisors. The SEC has slated the rule on its regulatory agenda for “long-term action” without a specific timetable.In October 2010, the DOL published the DOL Proposed Rule, which would more broadly define the circumstances under which a person or entity may be considered a fiduciary for purposes of the prohibited transaction rules of IRC Section 4975. IRC Section 4975 prohibits certain types of compensation paid by third parties with respect to transactions involving assets in qualified accounts, including IRAs. In September 2011, the DOL withdrew the DOL Proposed Rule. The DOL has indicated that it will re-propose a similar fiduciary rule in 2014. If PFS Investments and its securities-licensed representatives are deemed to be fiduciaries under a rule similar to the DOL Proposed Rule, our ability to receive and retain certain types of compensation paid by third parties with respect to both new and existing assets in qualified accounts could be significantly limited.IRAs and other qualified accounts are a core component of the Investment and Savings Products segment of our business and accounted for a significant portion of the total revenue of this segment for the year ended December 31, 2013. Thus, if a fiduciary rule similar to the DOL Proposed Rule is re-proposed and adopted, we would expect to substantially restructure our current business model for qualified accounts. Such restructuring could make it significantly more difficult for us and our sales representatives to profitably serve the middle-income market and could result in a significant reduction in the number of IRAs and qualified accounts that we serve, which could materially adversely affect the amount of revenue that we generate from this line of business and ultimately could result in a decline in the number of our securities-licensed sales representatives. Furthermore, our licensed representatives could be required to obtain additional securities licenses, which they may not be willing or able to obtain.The form, substance and timing of any re-proposed or final rule are unknown at this time. It is possible that a rule could be adopted in a form that does not materially adversely affect us. If re-proposed and adopted in the form initially proposed, however, the DOL Proposed Rule could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Heightened standards of conduct as a result of either of the above proposals or another similar proposed rule or regulation could also increase the compliance and regulatory burdens on our representatives, and could lead to increased litigation and regulatory risks, changes to our business model, a decrease in the number of our securities-licensed representatives and a reduction in the products we offer to our clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If our suitability policies and procedures were deemed inadequate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We review the account applications that we receive for our investment and savings products for suitability. While we believe that the policies and procedures we implemented to help our sales representatives assist clients in making appropriate and suitable investment choices are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, it is possible that the SEC, FINRA or MFDA may not agree. Further, we could be subject to regulatory actions or private litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 29Table of ContentsOur sales force support tools may fail to appropriately identify suitable investment products.Our support tools are designed to educate clients, help identify their financial needs, and introduce the potential benefits of our products. There could be a risk that the assumptions and methods of analyses embedded in our support tools could be successfully challenged and subject us to regulatory action or private litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Non-compliance with applicable regulations could lead to revocation of our subsidiary's status as a non-bank custodian.PFS Investments is a non-bank custodian of retirement accounts, as permitted under Treasury Regulation 1.408-2. A non-bank custodian is an entity that is not a bank and that is permitted by the IRS to act as a custodian for retirement plan account assets of our clients. The IRS retains authority to revoke or suspend that status if it finds that PFS Investments is unwilling or unable to administer retirement accounts in a manner consistent with the requirements of the applicable regulations. Revocation of PFS Investments' non-bank custodian status would affect its ability to earn revenue for providing such services and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Other Risks Related to Our BusinessChanges in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and could adversely impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. U.S. GAAP continues to evolve and, as a result, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to anticipate and implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (""FASB"") current insurance contracts accounting project could, among other things, significantly change the way we measure insurance liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the way we present earnings on our statement of income. This project, in addition to other projects such as the FASB’s financial instruments accounting project, could adversely impact both our financial condition and results of operations as reported on a U.S. GAAP basis as well as our statutory capital calculations.The effects of economic down cycles in the United States and Canada could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been materially adversely affected by economic downturns in the United States and Canada. Economic downturns, which are often characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower valuation of retirement savings accounts, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, have adversely affected the demand for the term life insurance, investment and other financial products that we sell. Future economic down cycles could severely adversely affect new sales and cause clients to liquidate mutual funds and other investments sold by our sales representatives. This could cause a decrease in the asset value of client accounts, reduce our trailing commission revenues and result in other-than-temporary-impairments in our invested asset portfolio. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of lapses or surrenders of insurance policies, and some of our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Further, volatility in equity markets or downturns could discourage purchases of the investment products that we distribute and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, including our ability to recruit and retain sales representatives.We are subject to various federal laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, changes in which or violations of which may require us to alter our business practices and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In the United States, we are subject to many regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations, including Regulation S-P, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the FTC Act, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. We are also subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, which requires us to develop and implement customer identification and risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report suspicious activity and maintain certain records. Further, we are required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are  30Table of Contentsadministered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control that prohibit or restrict transactions with suspected countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals.In Canada, we are subject to provincial and territorial regulations, including consumer protection legislation that pertains to unfair and misleading business practices, provincial and territorial credit reporting legislation that provides requirements in respect of obtaining credit bureau reports and providing notices of decline, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Competition Act, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the Telecommunications Act and certain Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Telecom Decisions in respect of unsolicited telecommunications. We are also subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and its accompanying regulations, which require us to develop and implement money laundering policies and procedures relating to customer indemnification, reporting and recordkeeping, develop and maintain ongoing training programs for employees, perform a risk assessment on our business and clients and institute and document a review of our anti-money laundering program at least once every two years. We are also required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions and legislation that prohibit us from, among other things, engaging in transactions with, and providing services to, persons on lists created under various federal statutes and regulations and blocked persons and foreign countries and territories subject to Canadian sanctions administered by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada and the Department of Public Safety Canada. Changes in, or violations of, any of these laws or regulations may require additional compliance procedures, or result in enforcement proceedings, sanctions or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Litigation and regulatory investigations and actions may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.We face a risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses. From time to time, we are subject to private litigation and regulatory investigations as a result of sales representative misconduct. In addition, we may become subject to lawsuits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, payment of improper sales commissions, claims issues, product design and disclosure, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, pricing and sales practices issues. Life insurance companies have historically been subject to substantial litigation resulting from policy disputes and other matters.  If we become subject to similar litigation, any judgment or settlement of such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we are subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities. For example, we have a large sales force, and we could face claims by some of our sales representatives arising out of their relationship with us. In particular, the memorandum of understanding that we signed in connection with the Florida Retirement System matters may not result in resolution with the claimants. In such event, the pending litigation with the existing claimants would continue, and, in any event, new claimants may emerge. We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas and books and record examinations, from state, provincial and federal regulators and other authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in any litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm and we could incur significant legal expenses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The current legislative and regulatory climate with regard to financial services may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The volume of legislative and regulatory activity relating to financial services has increased substantially in recent years, and we expect that the level of enforcement actions and investigations by federal regulators will increase correspondingly. The same factors that have contributed to legislative, regulatory and enforcement activity at the federal level are likely to contribute to heightened activity at the state and provincial level. If we or our sales representatives become subject to new requirements or regulations, it could result in increased litigation, regulatory risks, changes to our business model, a decrease in the number of our securities-licensed representatives or a reduction in the products we offer to our clients or the profits we earn, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 31Table of ContentsThe inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us in sufficient amounts would impede our ability to meet our obligations and return capital to our stockholders.We are a holding company, and we have no significant operations. Our primary asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries and our primary liability is our senior unsecured notes. We rely primarily on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet our operating costs, other corporate expenses, senior unsecured notes obligations, as well as to return capital to our stockholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us depends on their earnings, covenants contained in existing and future financing or other agreements and on regulatory restrictions. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends will further depend on their statutory income and surplus. If the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payments and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund our obligations or if a subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of equity or the sale of assets. However, given the historic volatility in the capital markets, there is no assurance that we would be able to raise cash by these means.The jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us. In the United States, these restrictions are based, in part, on the prior year's statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval.  Dividends in larger amounts are subject to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile. In Canada, dividends can be paid, subject to the paying insurance company continuing to meet the regulatory requirements for capital adequacy and liquidity and upon 15 days' minimum notice to OSFI. No assurance is given that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, and such restrictions could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to us by our subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, in the future, we may become subject to debt covenants or other agreements that limit our ability to return capital to our stockholders. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also limited by our need to maintain the financial strength ratings assigned to us by the ratings agencies.If any of our subsidiaries were to become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, we, as sole stockholder, will have no right to proceed against the assets of that subsidiary. Furthermore, with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, we, as sole stockholder, will have no right to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under the applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws, although, in Canada, we could apply for permission to cause liquidation. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors of the subsidiary and policyholders (if an insurance subsidiary) would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiary's assets before we, as the sole stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary.If the ability of our insurance or non-insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, bankruptcy or insolvency, or our need to maintain our financial strength ratings, or is limited due to operating results or other factors, it could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our obligations and return capital to our stockholders.A significant change in the competitive environment in which we operate could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.We face competition in all of our business lines. Our competitors include financial services companies, mutual fund companies, banks, investment management firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies and direct sales companies. In many of our product lines, we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do. A significant change in this competitive environment could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.The loss of key employees and sales force leaders could negatively affect our financial results and impair our ability to implement our business strategy. Our success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team. The efforts, personality and leadership of our senior management team have been, and will continue to be, critical to our success. The loss of service of our senior management team due to disability, death, retirement or some other cause could reduce our ability to successfully motivate our sales representatives and implement our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although our Co-Chief Executive  32Table of ContentsOfficers, as well as our other senior executives, have entered into employment agreements with us, there is no assurance that they will complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration.In addition, the loss of key RVPs for any reason could negatively affect our financial results, impair our ability to attract new sales representatives and hinder future growth.If one of our significant information technology systems fails, if its security is compromised or if the Internet becomes disabled or unavailable, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.Our business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are centered on a mainframe platform supported by servers housed at our home office and back-up site. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions. Our information technology systems run a variety of third-party and proprietary software, including POL (our website portal to our sales force), our insurance administration system, Virtual Base Shop (our paperless office for RVPs), TurboApps (our point-of-sale data collection tool for product/ recruiting applications), our licensing decision and support system and our compensation system.We are also dependent on information technology systems to record and process customer transactions and other components of our financial statements. We could experience a failure of one or more of these systems or could fail to complete all necessary data reconciliation or other conversion controls when implementing new software systems. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of electronic mobile devices such as laptops and smartphones, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. These risks are also applicable where we rely on outside vendors to provide services, which may operate in a cloud environment. We are dependent on certain third-party vendors to operate secure and reliable systems, which may include data transfers over the Internet.Despite the implementation of security and back-up measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, viruses or other attacks, programming errors and similar disruptions. The failure of any one of these systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We retain confidential information in our information technology systems, and we rely on industry standard commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our information technology systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable client information and proprietary business information. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions require that clients be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable client information.Operating system failures, ineffective system implementation, or the compromise of security with respect to internal or external operating systems or portable electronic devices could subject us to significant civil and criminal liability, harm our reputation, interrupt our business operations, deter people from purchasing our products, and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting, business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.In the event of a disaster, our business continuity plan may not be sufficient, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our infrastructure supports a combination of local and remote recovery solutions for business resumption in the event of a disaster. In the event of either a campus-wide destruction or the inability to access our main campus in Duluth, Georgia, our business recovery plan provides for our employees to perform their work functions via a dedicated business recovery site located 25 miles from our main campus or by remote access from an employee's home. However, in the event of a full scale local or regional disaster, our business recovery plan may be inadequate, and our employees and sales representatives may be unable to carry out their work, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the United States dollar versus the Canadian dollar.A weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would result in lower levels of reported revenues, net income, assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income in our U.S. dollar reporting currency financial statements. Significant exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 33Table of Contents"
8,PRI,PRIMERICA INC,2013-02-27,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.Risks Related to Our Distribution StructureOur failure to continue to attract new recruits, retain sales representatives or license or maintain the licensing of our sales representatives would materially adversely affect our business.New sales representatives provide us with access to new clients, enable us to increase sales and provide the next generation of successful sales representatives. As is typical with distribution businesses, we experience a high rate of turnover among our part-time sales representatives, which requires us to attract, retain and motivate a large number of sales representatives. Recruiting is performed by our current sales representatives, and the effectiveness of our recruiting is generally dependent upon our reputation as a provider of a rewarding and potentially lucrative income opportunity, as well as the general competitive and economic environment. Whether recruits are motivated to complete their training and licensing requirements and to commit to selling our products is largely dependent upon the effectiveness of our compensation and promotional programs and the competitiveness of such programs compared with other companies, including other part-time business opportunities.If our new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient interest to attract new recruits, motivate them to become licensed sales representatives and maintain their licenses and incentivize them to sell our products and recruit other new sales representatives, our business would be materially adversely affected.Furthermore, if we or any other businesses with a similar distribution structure engage in practices resulting in increased negative public attention for our business, the resulting reputational challenges could adversely affect our ability to attract new recruits. Companies such as ours that use independent agents to sell directly to customers can be the subject of negative commentary on website postings, social media and other non-traditional media. This negative commentary can spread inaccurate or incomplete information about distribution companies in general or our company in particular, which can make our recruiting more difficult.Certain of our key RVPs have large sales organizations that include thousands of downline sales representatives. These key RVPs are responsible for attracting, motivating, supporting and assisting the sales representatives in their sales organizations. The loss of one or more key RVPs together with a substantial number of their sales representatives for any reason could materially adversely affect our financial results and could impair our ability to attract new sales representatives.There are a number of laws and regulations that could apply to our distribution model, which subject us to the risk that we may have to modify our distribution structure.In the past, certain distribution models that use independent agents to sell directly to customers have been subject to challenge under various laws, including laws relating to business opportunities, franchising and unfair or deceptive trade practices.In general, state business opportunity and franchise laws in the United States prohibit sales of business opportunities or franchises unless the seller provides potential purchasers with a pre-sale disclosure document that has first been filed with a designated state agency and grants purchasers certain legal recourse against sellers of business opportunities and franchises. In Canada, the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have enacted legislation dealing with franchising, which typically requires mandatory disclosure to prospective franchisees.We have not been, and are not currently, subject to business opportunity laws because the amounts paid by our new representatives to us: (i) are less than the minimum thresholds set by many state statutes and (ii) are not fees paid for the right to participate in a business, but rather are for bona fide expenses such as state-required insurance examinations and pre-licensing training. We have not been, and are not currently, subject to franchise laws for similar reasons. However, 21Table of Contentsthere is a risk that a governmental agency or court could disagree with our assessment or that these laws and regulations could change. In addition, although we do not believe that the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"")'s Business Opportunity Rule applies to our company, it could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Becoming subject to business opportunity or franchise laws or regulations could require us to provide certain disclosures and regulate the manner in which we recruit our sales representatives that may increase the expense of, or adversely impact our success in, recruiting new sales representatives and make it more difficult for us to successfully attract and recruit new sales representatives.There are various laws and regulations that prohibit fraudulent or deceptive schemes known as pyramid schemes. In general, a pyramid scheme is defined as an arrangement in which new participants are required to pay a fee to participate in the organization and then receive compensation primarily for recruiting other persons to participate, either directly or through sales of goods or services that are merely disguised payments for recruiting others. The application of these laws and regulations to a given set of business practices is inherently fact-based and, therefore, is subject to interpretation by applicable enforcement authorities. Our representatives are paid by commissions based on sales of our products and services to bona fide purchasers, and for this and other reasons we do not believe that we are subject to laws regulating pyramid schemes. Moreover, our representatives are not required to purchase any of the products marketed by us. However, even though we believe that our distribution practices are currently in compliance with, or exempt from, these laws and regulations, there is a risk that a governmental agency or court could disagree with our assessment or that these laws and regulations could change, which may require us to cease our operations in certain jurisdictions or result in other costs or fines.There are also federal, state and provincial laws of general application, such as the FTC Act, and state or provincial unfair and deceptive trade practices laws that could potentially be invoked to challenge aspects of our recruiting of sales representatives and compensation practices. In particular, our recruiting efforts include promotional materials for recruits that describe the potential opportunity available to them if they join our sales force. These materials, as well as our other recruiting efforts and those of our sales representatives, are subject to scrutiny by the FTC and state and provincial enforcement authorities with respect to misleading statements, including misleading earnings claims made to convince potential new recruits to join our sales force. If claims made by us or by our sales representatives are deemed to be misleading, it could result in violations of the FTC Act or comparable state and provincial statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices or result in reputational harm.Being subject to, or out of compliance with, the aforementioned laws and regulations could require us to change our distribution structure, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.There may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of our sales representatives is successfully challenged.Our sales representatives are independent contractors who operate their own businesses. In the past, we have been successful in defending our company in various contexts before courts and governmental agencies against claims that our sales representatives should be treated like employees. Although we believe that we have properly classified our representatives as independent contractors, there is nevertheless a risk that the IRS or another authority will take a different view. Furthermore, the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact-sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent sales representatives are subject to change or interpretation by various authorities.The classification of workers as independent contractors has been the subject of federal legislative and regulatory interest over the last several years, with proposals being made that call for greater scrutiny of independent contractor classifications and greater penalties for companies who wrongly classify workers as independent contractors instead of employees. Thus far, none of these proposals has been enacted by the federal government. The DOL recently reiterated its intention first communicated in 2010 to pursue rulemaking under the Fair Labor Standards Act referred to as “Right to Know” and is expected to begin gathering information on the subject. If rules are adopted, companies such as Primerica that utilize independent contractors may be required to give each potential independent contractor information about that status, including how the classification was determined, an individual's rights to challenge his or her classification and disclosures of all of the possible downsides (such as lack of benefits, lack of pay protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act, etc.) of being categorized as an independent contractor. The U.S. House of Representatives has threatened to bar funding for such a study and rulemaking, but it is unclear if the recent elections weakened the resolve of the House of Representatives. Several states are considering similar efforts. We cannot predict the outcome of these legislative and regulatory efforts, but the topic of independent contractor classification seems likely to remain active.If a federal, state or provincial authority enacts legislation or adopts regulations that change the manner in which employees and independent contractors are classified or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of 22Table of Contentsour independent contractors, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws and regulations, including in respect of tax withholding, social security payments and recordkeeping, or we may be required to modify our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with federal, state, or provincial tax or employment laws or with respect to any applicable employee benefit plan.Our or our sales representatives' violation of, or non-compliance with, laws and regulations and the related claims and proceedings could expose us to material liabilities.Extensive federal, state, provincial and territorial laws regulate our products and our relationships with our clients, imposing certain requirements that our sales representatives must follow. At any given time, we may have pending state, federal or provincial examinations or inquiries of our investment and savings products and insurance businesses. In addition to imposing requirements that representatives must follow in their dealings with clients, these laws and regulations generally require us to maintain a system of supervision to attempt to ensure that our sales representatives comply with the requirements to which they are subject. We have developed policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations. However, despite these compliance and supervisory efforts, the breadth of our operations and the broad regulatory requirements could result in oversight failures and instances of non-compliance or misconduct on the part of our sales representatives.From time to time, we are subject to private litigation as a result of alleged misconduct by our sales representatives. Examples include claims that a sales representative's failure to disclose underwriting-related information regarding the insured on an insurance application resulted in the denial of a life insurance policy claim, and with respect to investment and savings products sales, errors or omissions that a representative made in connection with an account. In addition to the potential for non-compliance with laws or misconduct applicable to our existing product offerings, we could experience similar regulatory issues or litigation with respect to new products, such as debt resolution referrals. Non-compliance or misconduct by our sales representatives could result in adverse findings in either examinations or litigation and could subject us to sanctions, monetary liabilities, restrictions on or the loss of the operation of our business, claims against us or reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any failure to protect the confidentiality of client information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Pursuant to federal laws, various federal agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, most states and some provinces have enacted laws, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. Many of our sales representatives and employees have access to, and routinely process, personal information of clients through a variety of media, including the Internet and software applications. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, our company, our employees and our sales representatives. It is possible that a sales representative or employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if our sales representatives or employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Insurance Business and ReinsuranceWe may face significant losses if our actual experience differs from our expectations regarding mortality or persistency.We set prices for life insurance policies based upon expected claim payment patterns derived from assumptions we make about the mortality rates, or likelihood of death, of our policyholders in any given year. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual mortality rates compare to our pricing assumptions. For example, if mortality rates are higher than those assumed in our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make more death benefit payments under our life insurance policies or to make such payments sooner than we had projected, which may decrease the profitability of our term life insurance products and result in an increase in the cost of our subsequent reinsurance transactions.23Table of ContentsThe prices and expected future profitability of our life insurance products are also based, in part, upon assumptions related to persistency. Actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse effect on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy. Actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse effect on profitability in the later years of a block of policies because the anticipated claims experience is higher in these later years. If actual persistency is significantly different from that assumed in our pricing assumptions, our reserves for future policy benefits may prove to be inadequate. We are precluded from adjusting premiums on our in-force business during the initial term of the policies, and our ability to adjust premiums on in-force business after the initial policy term is limited to the maximum premium rates in the policy.Our assumptions and estimates regarding mortality and persistency require us to make numerous judgments and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the actual persistency or ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claim payments on a block of policies, the timing of those payments, or whether the assets supporting these contingent future payment obligations will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of claims. If we conclude that our reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover actual or expected claims payments and the scheduled amortization of our deferred policy acquisition costs (""DAC"") assets, we would be required to first accelerate our amortization of the DAC assets and then increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The occurrence of a catastrophic event could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events, which could cause a large number of premature deaths of our insureds.  A catastrophic event could also cause significant volatility in global financial markets and disrupt the economy. Although we have ceded a significant majority of our mortality risk to reinsurers, a catastrophic event could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims resulting from a catastrophic event could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any quarter or year and could also materially harm the financial condition of our reinsurers, which would increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new business could also be adversely affected.In addition, most of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business require life insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which raise funds to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed issuers. It is possible that a catastrophic event could require extraordinary assessments on our insurance companies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance business is highly regulated, and statutory and regulatory changes may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Life insurance statutes and regulations are generally designed to protect the interests of the public and policyholders.  Those interests may conflict with the interests of our stockholders.  Currently, in the United States, the power to regulate insurance resides almost exclusively with the states. The laws of the various U.S. jurisdictions grant state insurance regulators broad powers to regulate almost all aspects of our insurance business. Much of this state regulation follows model statutes or regulations developed or amended by the NAIC, which is composed of the insurance commissioners of each U.S. jurisdiction. The NAIC re-examines and amends existing model laws and regulations (including holding company regulations) in addition to determining whether new ones are needed.The U.S. Congress continues to examine the current condition of U.S. state-based insurance regulation to determine whether to impose federal regulation and to allow optional federal insurance company incorporation. The Dodd-Frank Act created an Office of Federal Insurance Reform that was authorized to, among other things, study methods to modernize and improve insurance regulation, including uniformity and the feasibility of federal regulation. We cannot predict with certainty whether, or in what form, reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will materially affect our business. Changes in federal statutes, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, financial services regulation and federal taxation, in addition to changes to state statutes and regulations, may be more restrictive than current requirements or may result in higher costs, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company is currently undergoing a Multi-State Treasurer Unclaimed Property Audit by 13 jurisdictions and Department of Insurance Claims and Unclaimed Property Audit of Primerica Life and National Benefit Life by six jurisdictions. Additionally, the State of West Virginia Treasurer has sued Primerica Life and many other insurance companies, alleging violations of the West Virginia unclaimed property act. Neither the audits nor the litigation have 24Table of Contentsproceeded beyond initial notifications and we cannot predict with certainty the effect they may have on the conduct of our business, financial condition and results of operations.Provincial and federal insurance laws regulate all aspects of our Canadian insurance business. Changes to provincial or federal statutes and regulations may be more restrictive than current requirements or may result in higher costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If OSFI determines that our corporate actions do not comply with applicable Canadian law, Primerica Life Canada could face sanctions or fines, and Primerica Life Canada could be subject to increased capital requirements or other requirements deemed appropriate by OSFI.We received approval from the Minister of Finance (Canada) under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada) in connection with our indirect acquisition of Primerica Life Canada. The Minister expects that a person controlling a federal insurance company will provide ongoing financial, managerial or operational support to its subsidiary should such support prove necessary, and has required us to sign a support principle letter to that effect. This ongoing support may take the form of additional capital, the provision of managerial expertise or the provision of support in such areas as risk management, internal control systems and training. However, the letter does not create a legal obligation on the part of the person to provide the support. In the event that OSFI determines Primerica Life Canada is not receiving adequate support from us under applicable Canadian law, Primerica Life Canada may be subject to increased capital requirements or other requirements deemed appropriate by OSFI.If there were to be extraordinary changes to statutory or regulatory requirements in the United States or Canada, we may be unable to fully comply with or maintain all required insurance licenses and approvals. Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have all requisite licenses and approvals, or do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our insurance activities or impose fines or penalties on us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation or regulatory initiatives may have on the conduct of our business.A decline in the regulatory capital ratios of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and ratings agencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to RBC standards (imposed under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of domicile). The RBC formula for U.S. life insurance companies generally establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to report their results of RBC calculations annually to the applicable state department of insurance and the NAIC. Our Canadian life insurance subsidiary is subject to minimum continuing capital and surplus requirements (“MCCSR”), and Tier 1 capital ratio requirements, and is required to provide its MCCSR and Tier 1 capital ratio calculations to the Canadian regulators. The capitalization of our insurance subsidiaries is maintained at levels in excess of the effective minimum requirements of the NAIC in the United States and OSFI in Canada. In any particular year, statutory capital and surplus amounts and RBC and MCCSR ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which is sensitive to equity and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in their reserve requirements, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in their investment portfolios, the credit ratings of investments held in their portfolios, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates, credit market volatility, changes in consumer behavior, as well as changes to the NAIC's RBC formula or the MCCSR calculation of OSFI. Many of these factors are outside of our control.Our financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC and MCCSR ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. Ratings agencies may change their internal models, effectively increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to maintain their current ratings. In addition, ratings agencies may downgrade the invested assets held in our portfolio, which could result in a reduction of their capital and surplus. Changes in statutory accounting principles could also adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries' ability to meet minimum RBC, MCCSR and statutory capital and surplus requirements. There is no assurance that our insurance subsidiaries will not need additional capital or, if needed, that we will be able to provide it to maintain the targeted RBC and MCCSR levels to support their business operations.The failure of any of our insurance subsidiaries to meet its applicable RBC and MCCSR requirements or minimum capital and surplus requirements could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed by insurance regulators, including limitations on its ability to write additional business, supervision by regulators or seizure or liquidation. Any corrective action imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of 25Table of Contentsoperations. A decline in RBC or MCCSR also limits the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions and could be a factor in causing ratings agencies to downgrade the financial strength ratings of all our insurance subsidiaries. Such downgrades would have an adverse effect on our ability to write new insurance business and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to redeploy capital through reserve financing transactions.Certain state regulators, as well as the NAIC, have been reviewing the use of captive insurance companies for the purpose of redundant reserve financing transactions, and it is uncertain whether state regulators will continue to approve such transactions going forward. As a result, Primerica Life may not be able to redeploy capital to the Parent Company through reserve financing transactions in the future.A ratings downgrade by a ratings organization could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Each of our insurance subsidiaries, with the exception of Peach Re, has been assigned a financial strength rating by A.M. Best. Primerica Life currently also has an insurer financial strength rating from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. NBLIC, Primerica Life Canada, and Peach Re are not rated by Standard & Poor's, Moody's or Fitch.The financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic review using, among other things, the ratings agencies' proprietary capital adequacy models, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and are not intended for the protection of stockholders or as a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities. Our financial strength ratings will affect our competitive position relative to other insurance companies. If the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries fall below certain levels, some of our policyholders may move their business to our competitors. In addition, the models used by ratings agencies to determine financial strength are different from the capital requirements set by insurance regulators.Ratings organizations review the financial performance and financial conditions of insurance companies, and provide opinions regarding financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders. A downgrade in the financial strength ratings of any of our insurance subsidiaries, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including by:•reducing sales of insurance products;•adversely affecting our relationships with our sales representatives;•materially increasing the amount of policy cancellations by our policyholders;•requiring us to reduce prices to remain competitive; and•adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all.If the rating agencies or regulators change their approach to financial strength ratings and statutory capital requirements, we may need to take action to maintain current ratings and capital adequacy ratios, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, the Parent Company currently has investment grade credit ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and A.M. Best for its senior unsecured debt. These ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations and are important factors in its ability to access liquidity in the debt markets. A rating downgrade by a rating agency can occur at any time if the rating agency perceives an adverse change in our financial condition, results of operations or ability to service debt. If such a downgrade occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including adversely limiting our access to capital in the unsecured debt market and potentially increasing the cost of such debt.Credit deterioration in, and the effects of interest rate fluctuations on, our invested asset portfolio could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.A large percentage of our invested asset portfolio is invested in fixed-income securities. As a result, credit deterioration and interest rate fluctuations could materially affect the value and earnings of our invested asset portfolio. Fixed-income securities decline in value if there is no active trading market for the securities or the market's impression of, or the ratings agencies' views on, the credit quality of an issuer worsens. During periods of declining market interest rates, any interest income we receive on variable interest rate investments would decrease, and we would be forced to invest the cash we receive as interest, return of principal on our investments and cash from operations in lower-yielding, high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of fixed-income securities could also decide to prepay their obligations to borrow at lower market rates, which would increase our reinvestment risk. If interest 26Table of Contentsrates generally increase, the market value of our fixed rate income portfolio decreases. Additionally, if the market value of any security in our invested asset portfolio decreases, we may realize losses if we deem the value of the security to be other-than-temporarily impaired. To the extent that any fluctuations in fair value or interest rates are significant or we recognize impairments that are material, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Valuation of our investments and the determination of whether a decline in the fair value of our invested assets is other-than-temporary are based on estimates that may prove to be incorrect.U.S. GAAP requires that when the fair value of any of our invested assets declines and such decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we recognize a loss in either accumulated other comprehensive income or on our statement of income based on certain criteria in the period that such determination is made. Determining the fair value of certain invested assets, particularly those that do not trade on a regular basis, requires an assessment of available data and the use of assumptions and estimates. Once it is determined that the fair value of an asset is below its carrying value, we must determine whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which is based on subjective factors and involves a variety of assumptions and estimates.There are certain risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in market value are other-than-temporary. These include significant changes in general economic conditions and business markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and assumptions and legislative actions. In the case of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, there is added uncertainty as to the performance of the underlying collateral assets. To the extent that we are incorrect in our determination of the fair value of our investment securities or our determination that a decline in their value is other-than-temporary, we may realize losses that never actually materialize or may fail to recognize losses within the appropriate reporting period.The failure by any of our reinsurers to perform its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We extensively use reinsurance in the United States to diversify our risk and to manage our loss exposure to mortality risk. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. We, as the insurer, are required to pay the full amount of death benefits even in circumstances where we are entitled to receive payments from the reinsurer. Due to factors such as insolvency, adverse underwriting results or inadequate investment returns, our reinsurers may not be able to pay the amounts they owe us on a timely basis or at all. Further, reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them or might delay payment. Since death benefit claims may be paid long after a policy is issued, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we can recover amounts to which we are entitled. Any such failure to pay by our reinsurers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The failure by the affiliates of Citigroup who are parties to the Citigroup reinsurance transactions to perform their obligations to us under our coinsurance agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Immediately prior to the IPO, we entered into four coinsurance agreements with three reinsurer affiliates of Citigroup pursuant to which we ceded between 80% and 90% of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year-end 2009. Under this arrangement, our current third-party reinsurance agreements remain in place. The largest of these transactions involved two coinsurance agreements between Primerica Life and Prime Reinsurance Company, Inc. (""Prime Re""), then a wholly owned subsidiary of Primerica Life. Pursuant to these reinsurance agreements, we distributed to Citigroup all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Prime Re. Prime Re was formed solely for the purpose of entering into these reinsurance transactions, had no operating history at the time the coinsurance agreements were executed and does not possess a financial strength rating from any rating agency. The other transactions were between (i) Primerica Life Canada and Financial Reassurance Company 2010 Ltd., a Bermuda reinsurer and wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, formed to operate solely for the purpose of reinsuring Citigroup-related risks and (ii) NBLIC and American Health and Life Insurance Company (“AHL”), a wholly owned insurance subsidiary of Citigroup that has a financial strength rating of “A” by A.M. Best. Each of the three reinsurers entered into trust agreements with our respective insurance subsidiaries and a trustee pursuant to which the reinsurer placed assets (primarily treasury and fixed-income securities) in trust for such subsidiary's benefit to secure the reinsurer's obligations to such subsidiary. Each such coinsurance agreement requires each reinsurer to maintain assets in trust sufficient to give the subsidiary full credit for regulatory purposes for the insurance, which amount will not be less than the amount of the reserves for the reinsured liabilities. In addition, in the case of the reinsurance transactions between Prime Re and Primerica Life, Citigroup has agreed in a capital maintenance agreement to maintain Prime Re's RBC above a specified minimum level, subject to a maximum amount being contributed by Citigroup. In the case of the reinsurance transaction 27Table of Contentsbetween NBLIC and AHL, Citigroup has agreed to over-collateralize the assets in the trust for NBLIC for the life of the coinsurance agreement between NBLIC and AHL. Furthermore, our insurance subsidiaries have the right to recapture the business upon the occurrence of an event of default under their respective coinsurance agreement with the Citigroup affiliates subject to any applicable cure periods. An event of default includes: (1) a reinsurer insolvency, (2) failure through the fault of the reinsurer to provide full statutory financial statement credit for the reinsurance ceded, (3) a material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty by the reinsurer, (4) failure by the reinsurer to fund the trust account required to be established under the coinsurance agreements in any material respects, or (5) in connection with the coinsurance agreements with Prime Re, failure by Citigroup to maintain sufficient capital in the reinsurer, pursuant to the capital maintenance agreement between Citigroup and the reinsurer within 45 calendar days of any demand for payment by or on behalf of Primerica Life, and any 45-day extension thereof as consented to by Primerica Life, which consent may not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld, for a total of not more than 90 days to obtain such consent; provided that Primerica Life is not required to consent to extend such period beyond an additional 45 days. While any such recapture would be at no cost to us, such recapture would result in a substantial increase in our insurance exposure and require us to be fully responsible for the management of the assets set aside to support statutory reserves. The type of assets we might obtain as a result of a recapture may not be as liquid as our current invested asset portfolio and could result in an unfavorable impact on our risk profile.There is no assurance that the relevant Citigroup reinsurer will pay the reinsurance obligations owed to us now or in the future or that it will pay these obligations on a timely basis. Notwithstanding the capital maintenance agreement between Prime Re and Citigroup and the initial over-collateralization of assets in trust for the benefit of our insurance companies, if any of the Citigroup reinsurers becomes insolvent, the amount in the trust account to support the obligations of such reinsurer is insufficient to pay such reinsurer's obligations to us and we fail to enforce our right to recapture the business, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Investments and Savings Products BusinessOur investment and savings products segment is heavily dependent on mutual fund and annuity products offered by a relatively small number of companies and if these products fail to remain competitive with other investment options or we lose our relationship with one or more of these fund companies or with the source of our annuity products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.We earn a significant portion of our earnings through our relationships with a small group of mutual fund and annuity companies. A decision by one or more of these companies to alter or discontinue their current arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any of our investment and savings products fail to achieve satisfactory investment performance, our clients may seek higher yielding alternative investment products and we could experience higher redemption rates. In such circumstances, we may also experience re-allocations of existing client assets and increased allocations of new assets to investment and savings products with higher investment returns, which ultimately results in changes in our mix of business. Since different investment and savings products have different revenue and expense characteristics, such changes could have significant negative consequences for us.In recent years there has been an increase in the popularity of alternative investments, which we do not currently offer, principally index funds and exchange traded funds. These investment options typically have low fee structures and provide some of the attributes of mutual funds, such as risk diversification. If these products continue to gain traction among our client base as viable alternatives to mutual fund investments, our investment and savings products revenues could decline.In addition to sales commissions and asset-based compensation, a portion of our earnings from investment and savings products comes from recordkeeping services that we provide to third parties and from fees earned for custodial services that we provide to clients with retirement plan accounts in the funds of these mutual fund companies. We also receive revenue sharing payments from each of these mutual fund companies. A decision by one or more of these fund companies to alter or discontinue their current arrangements with us would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our or our securities-licensed sales representatives violations of, or non-compliance with, laws and regulations could expose us to material liabilities.Our subsidiary broker-dealer and registered investment advisor, PFS Investments, is subject to federal and state regulation of its securities business. These regulations cover sales practices, trade suitability, supervision of registered 28Table of Contentsrepresentatives, recordkeeping, the conduct and qualification of officers and employees, the rules and regulations of the MSRB and state blue sky regulation. Investment advisory representatives are generally held to a higher standard of conduct than registered representatives. Our subsidiary, PSS, is a registered transfer agent engaged in the recordkeeping business and is subject to SEC regulation. Violations of laws or regulations applicable to the activities of PFS Investments or PSS, or violations by a third party with which PFS Investments or PSS contracts which improperly performs its task, could subject us to disciplinary actions and could result in the imposition of cease and desist orders, fines or censures, restitution to clients, disciplinary actions, including the potential suspension or revocation of its license by the SEC, or the suspension or expulsion from FINRA and reputational damage, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our Canadian dealer subsidiary, PFSL Investments Canada and its sales representatives are subject to the securities laws of the provinces and territories of Canada in which we sell our mutual fund products and those of third parties and to the rules of the MFDA, the self-regulatory organization governing mutual fund dealers. PFSL Investments Canada is subject to periodic review by both the MFDA and the provincial and territorial securities commissions to assess its compliance with, among other things, applicable capital requirements and sales practices and procedures. These regulators have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business for failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations. Possible sanctions that could be imposed include the suspension of individual sales representatives, limitations on the activities in which the dealer may engage, suspension or revocation of the dealer registration, censure or fines, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If heightened standards of conduct or more stringent licensing requirements, such as those proposed by the SEC and proposed and withdrawn by the DOL, are imposed on us or our sales representatives or selling compensation is reduced as a result of new legislation or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our U.S. sales representatives are subject to federal and state regulation as well as state licensing requirements. PFS Investments, which is regulated as a broker-dealer, and our U.S. sales representatives are currently subject to general anti-fraud limitations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") and SEC rules and regulations, as well as other conduct standards prescribed by FINRA. These standards generally require that broker-dealers and their sales representatives disclose conflicts of interest that might affect the advice or recommendations they provide and require them to make suitable investment recommendations to their customers. In January 2011 under the authority of the Dodd-Frank Act, which gives the SEC the power to impose on broker-dealers a heightened standard of conduct that is currently applicable only to investment advisers, the SEC staff submitted a report to Congress in which it recommended that the SEC adopt a fiduciary standard of conduct for broker-dealers that is uniform with that of investment advisors. However, the rulemaking process has been delayed as the SEC conducts a cost-benefit analysis to assess the impact of a uniform fiduciary proposal. The timing of any future rulemaking is unclear. In October 2010, the DOL published the DOL Proposed Rule, which would more broadly define the circumstances under which a person or entity may be considered a fiduciary for purposes of the prohibited transaction rules of IRC Section 4975. IRC Section 4975 prohibits certain types of compensation paid by third parties with respect to transactions involving assets in qualified accounts, including IRAs. In September 2011, the DOL withdrew the DOL Proposed Rule, but has indicated that it will re-propose a similar fiduciary rule in 2013. If PFS Investments and its securities-licensed representatives are deemed to be fiduciaries under a rule similar to the DOL Proposed Rule, our ability to receive and retain certain types of compensation paid by third parties with respect to both new and existing assets in qualified accounts could be significantly limited.IRAs and other qualified accounts are a core component of the Investment and Savings Products segment of our business and accounted for a significant portion of the total revenue of this segment for the year ended December 31, 2012. Thus, if a fiduciary rule similar to the DOL Proposed Rule is re-proposed and adopted, we would expect to substantially restructure our current business model for qualified accounts. Such restructuring could make it significantly more difficult for us and our representatives to profitably serve the middle-income market and could result in a significant reduction in the number of IRAs and qualified accounts that we serve, which could materially adversely affect the amount of revenue that we generate from this line of business and ultimately could result in a decline in the number of our securities-licensed representatives. Furthermore, our licensed representatives could be required to obtain additional securities licenses, which they may not be willing or able to obtain.The form, substance and timing of any re-proposed or final rule are unknown at this time. It is possible that a rule could be adopted in a form that does not materially adversely affect us. If re-proposed and adopted in the form initially proposed, however, the DOL Proposed Rule could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.29Table of ContentsHeightened standards of conduct as a result of either of the above proposals or another similar proposed rule or regulation could also increase the compliance and regulatory burdens on our representatives, and could lead to increased litigation and regulatory risks, changes to our business model, a decrease in the number of our securities-licensed representatives and a reduction in the products we offer to our clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If our suitability policies and procedures were deemed inadequate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We review the account applications that we receive for our investment and savings products for suitability. While we believe that the policies and procedures we implemented to help our sales representatives assist clients in making appropriate and suitable investment choices are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, it is possible that the SEC, FINRA or MFDA may not agree. Further, we could be subject to regulatory actions or private litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our sales force support tools may fail to appropriately identify suitable investment products.Our support tools are designed to educate clients, help identify their financial needs, and introduce the potential benefits of our products. There could be a risk that the assumptions and methods of analyses embedded in our support tools could be successfully challenged and subject us to regulatory action or private litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Non-compliance with applicable regulations could lead to revocation of our subsidiary's status as a non-bank custodian.PFS Investments is a non-bank custodian of retirement accounts, as permitted under Treasury Regulation 1.408-2. A non-bank custodian is an entity that is not a bank and that is permitted by the IRS to act as a custodian for retirement plan account assets of our clients. The IRS retains authority to revoke or suspend that status if it finds that PFS Investments is unwilling or unable to administer retirement accounts in a manner consistent with the requirements of the applicable regulations. Revocation of PFS Investments' non-bank custodian status would affect its ability to earn revenue for providing such services and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Other Risks Related to Our BusinessChanges in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and could adversely impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. U.S. GAAP continues to evolve and, as a result, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to anticipate and implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the FASB's current insurance contracts project could, among other things, significantly change the way we measure insurance liabilities on our balance sheet and the way we present earnings on our statement of income. This project, in addition to a related proposal to modify how to account for insurance contracts under IFRS, could adversely impact both our financial condition and results of operations as reported on a U.S. GAAP basis as well as our statutory capital calculations.The effects of economic down cycles in the United States and Canada could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been materially adversely affected by the economic downturn in the United States and Canada and the slow recovery that has occurred since the last half of 2009. This economic downturn, which has been characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower valuation of retirement savings accounts, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, has adversely affected the demand for the term life insurance, investment and other financial products that we sell. Future economic down cycles could severely adversely affect new sales and cause clients to liquidate mutual funds and other investments sold by our sales representatives. This could cause a decrease in the asset value of client accounts, reduce our trailing commission revenues and result in other-than-temporary-impairments in our invested asset portfolio. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of lapses or surrenders of insurance policies, and some of our 30Table of Contentspolicyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Further, volatility in equity markets or downturns could discourage purchases of the investment products that we distribute and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, including our ability to recruit and retain sales representatives. If credit markets remain tight for a prolonged period, our liquidity will be more limited than it otherwise would have been, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.We are subject to various federal laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, changes in which or violations of which may require us to alter our business practices and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In the United States, we are subject to many regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations, including Regulation S-P, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the FTC Act, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. We are also subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, which requires us to develop and implement customer identification and risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report suspicious activity and maintain certain records. We are also required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control that prohibit or restrict transactions with suspected countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals.In Canada, we are subject to provincial and territorial regulations, including consumer protection legislation that pertains to unfair and misleading business practices, provincial and territorial credit reporting legislation that provides requirements in respect of obtaining credit bureau reports and providing notices of decline, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Competition Act, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the Telecommunications Act and certain Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Telecom Decisions in respect of unsolicited telecommunications. We are also subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and its accompanying regulations, which require us to develop and implement money laundering policies and procedures relating to customer indemnification, reporting and recordkeeping, develop and maintain ongoing training programs for employees, perform a risk assessment on our business and clients and institute and document a review of our anti-money laundering program at least once every two years. We are also required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions and legislation that prohibit us from, among other things, engaging in transactions with, and providing services to, persons on lists created under various federal statutes and regulations and blocked persons and foreign countries and territories subject to Canadian sanctions administered by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada and the Department of Public Safety Canada. Changes in, or violations of, any of these laws or regulations may require additional compliance procedures, or result in enforcement proceedings, sanctions or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Litigation and regulatory investigations and actions may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.We face a risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses. From time to time, we are subject to private litigation and regulatory investigations as a result of sales representative misconduct. In addition, we may become subject to lawsuits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, payment of improper sales commissions, claims issues, product design and disclosure, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, pricing and sales practices issues. Life insurance companies have historically been subject to substantial litigation resulting from policy disputes and other matters.  If we become subject to similar litigation, any judgment or settlement of such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we are subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities. For example, we have a large sales force, and we could face claims by some of our sales representatives arising out of their relationship with us. We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas and books and record examinations, from state, provincial and federal regulators and other authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in any litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm and we could incur significant legal expenses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.31Table of ContentsThe current legislative and regulatory climate with regard to financial services may adversely affect our operations.The volume of legislative and regulatory activity relating to financial services has increased substantially in recent years, and we expect that the level of enforcement actions and investigations by federal regulators will increase correspondingly. The same factors that have contributed to legislative, regulatory and enforcement activity at the federal level are likely to contribute to heightened activity at the state and provincial level. If we or our sales representatives become subject to new requirements or regulations, it could result in increased litigation, regulatory risks, changes to our business model, a decrease in the number of our securities-licensed representatives or a reduction in the products we offer to our clients or the profits we earn, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us in sufficient amounts would impede our ability to meet our obligations.We are a holding company, and we have no significant operations. Our primary asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries and our primary liability is our senior unsecured notes. We rely primarily on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet our operating costs and other corporate expenses, as well as to pay dividends to our stockholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us depends on their earnings, covenants contained in existing and future financing or other agreements and on regulatory restrictions. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends will further depend on their statutory income and surplus. If the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payments and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund our obligations or if a subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of equity or the sale of assets. However, given the recent volatility in the capital markets, there is no assurance that we would be able to raise cash by these means.The jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us. In the United States, these restrictions are based, in part, on the prior year's statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval.  Dividends in larger amounts are subject to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile. In Canada, dividends can be paid, subject to the paying insurance company continuing to meet the regulatory requirements for capital adequacy and liquidity and upon 15 days' minimum notice to OSFI. No assurance is given that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, and such restrictions could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to us by our subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, in the future, we may become subject to debt covenants or other agreements that limit our ability to pay dividends. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also limited by our need to maintain the financial strength ratings assigned to us by the ratings agencies.If any of our subsidiaries were to become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, we, as sole stockholder, will have no right to proceed against the assets of that subsidiary. Furthermore, with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, we, as sole stockholder, will have no right to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under the applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws, although, in Canada, we could apply for permission to cause liquidation. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors of the subsidiary and policyholders (if an insurance subsidiary) would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiary's assets before we, as the sole stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary, which could adversely affect our ability to pay our operating costs and other corporate expenses.If the ability of our insurance or non-insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, bankruptcy or insolvency, or our need to maintain our financial strength ratings, or is limited due to operating results or other factors, it could materially adversely affect our ability to pay our operating costs and other corporate expenses.We may not be able to raise capital through debt or equity offerings if needed to meet our operating and regulatory capital requirements or for other purposes.Historically, we have funded our new business capital needs from cash flows provided by premiums paid on our in-force book of term life insurance policies. As a result of the Citigroup reinsurance transactions, the net cash flow we retain from our then-existing block of term life insurance policies was reduced proportionately to the size of our retained interest. As we grow our term life insurance business by issuing new policies, we will need to fund all of the upfront cash requirements 32Table of Contentsof issuing new term life policies (such as commissions payable to the sales force and underwriting expenses), which costs generally exceed premiums collected in a policy's first year. In light of these anticipated net cash outflows, there will be significant demands on our liquidity in the near- to intermediate-term as we grow the size of our retained block of term life insurance policies. Therefore, to meet our operating and regulatory requirements, we may incur debt or issue equity to fund working capital and capital expenditures or to make acquisitions and other investments. If we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred equity securities, any such debt securities or preferred equity securities issued will have liquidation rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If we raise funds through the issuance of equity securities, the issuance will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we may be unable to maintain or grow our business.A significant change in the competitive environment in which we operate could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.We face competition in all of our business lines. Our competitors include financial services companies, mutual fund companies, banks, investment management firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies and direct sales companies. In many of our product lines, we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do. A significant change in this competitive environment could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.The loss of key employees and sales force leaders could negatively affect our financial results and impair our ability to implement our business strategy. Our success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team. The efforts, personality and leadership of our senior management team have been, and will continue to be, critical to our success. The loss of service of our senior management team due to disability, death, retirement or some other cause could reduce our ability to successfully motivate our sales representatives and implement our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Messrs. John Addison and Rick Williams, our Co-Chief Executive Officers, are well regarded by our sales representatives and have substantial experience in our business and, therefore, are particularly important to our company. Although both Messrs. Addison and Williams, as well as our other senior executives, have entered into employment agreements with us, there is no assurance that they will complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. Our employment agreements with our Co-Chief Executive Officers expire in August 2015, and our employment agreements with our senior executives other than our Co-Chief Executive Officers expire June 1, 2014. All such agreements are then subject to one-year auto-renewal terms on an annual basis.In addition, the loss of key RVPs for any reason could negatively affect our financial results and could impair our ability to attract new sales representatives.If one of our significant information technology systems fails, if its security is compromised or if the Internet becomes disabled or unavailable, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.Our business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are centered on a mainframe platform supported by servers housed at our home office and back-up site. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions. Our information technology systems run a variety of third-party and proprietary software, including POL (our website portal to our sales force), our insurance administration system, Virtual Base Shop (our paperless office for RVPs), TurboApps (our point-of-sale data collection tool for product/ recruiting applications), our licensing decision and support system and our compensation system.Despite the implementation of security and back-up measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, viruses or other attacks, programming errors and similar disruptions. The failure of any one of these systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We retain confidential information in our information technology systems, and we rely on industry standard commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our information technology systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable client information and proprietary business information. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions require that clients be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable client information. Any compromise of the security of our information technology systems that results in inappropriate disclosure or use of personally 33Table of Contentsidentifiable client information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.In the event of a disaster, our business continuity plan may not be sufficient, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our infrastructure supports a combination of local and remote recovery solutions for business resumption in the event of a disaster. In the event of either a campus-wide destruction of all buildings or the inability to access our main campus in Duluth, Georgia, our business recovery plan provides for our employees to perform their work functions via a dedicated business recovery site located 25 miles from our main campus or by remote access from an employee's home. However, in the event of a full scale local or regional disaster, our business recovery plan may be inadequate, and our employees and sales representatives may be unable to carry out their work, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the United States dollar versus the Canadian dollar.A weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would result in lower levels of reported revenues, net income, assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income in our U.S. dollar financial statements. Significant exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations"
2,PRI,PRIMERICA INC,2012-02-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.Risks Related to Our Distribution StructureOur failure to continue to attract new recruits, retain sales representatives or license or maintain the licensing of our sales representatives would materially adversely affect our business.New sales representatives provide us with access to new referrals, enable us to increase sales, expand our client base and provide the next generation of successful sales representatives. As is typical with distribution businesses, we experience a high rate of turnover among our part-time sales representatives, which requires us to attract, retain and motivate a large number of sales representatives. Recruiting is performed by our current sales representatives, and the effectiveness of our recruiting is generally dependent upon our reputation as a provider of a rewarding and potentially lucrative income opportunity, as well as the general competitive and economic environment. The motivation of recruits to complete their training and licensing requirements and to commit to selling our products is largely dependent upon the effectiveness of our compensation and promotional programs and the competitiveness of such programs compared with other companies, including other part-time business opportunities. 21Table of ContentsIf our new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient interest to attract new recruits, motivate them to become licensed sales representatives and maintain their licenses and incentivize them to sell our products and recruit other new sales representatives, our business would be materially adversely affected.Furthermore, if we or any other direct sales businesses with a similar distribution structure engage in practices resulting in increased negative public attention for our business, the resulting reputational challenges could adversely affect our ability to attract new recruits. Direct sales companies such as ours can be the subject of negative commentary on website postings, social media and other non-traditional media. This negative commentary can spread inaccurate or incomplete information about the direct sales industry in general or our company in particular, which can make our recruiting more difficult.Certain of our key RVPs have large sales organizations that include thousands of downline sales representatives. These key RVPs are responsible for attracting, motivating, supporting and assisting the sales representatives in their sales organizations. The loss of one or more key RVPs together with a substantial number of their sales representatives for any reason, including movement to a competitor, or any other event that causes the departure of a large number of sales representatives, could materially adversely affect our financial results and could impair our ability to attract new sales representatives.There are a number of laws and regulations that could apply to our distribution model, which subject us to the risk that we may have to modify our distribution structure.In the past, certain direct sales distribution models have been subject to challenge under various laws, including laws relating to business opportunities, franchising, pyramid schemes and unfair or deceptive trade practices. In general, state business opportunity and franchise laws in the United States prohibit sales of business opportunities or franchises unless the seller provides potential purchasers with a pre-sale disclosure document that has first been filed with a designated state agency and grants purchasers certain legal recourse against sellers of business opportunities and franchises. In Canada, the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have enacted legislation dealing with franchising, which typically requires mandatory disclosure to prospective franchisees. We have not been, and are not currently, subject to business opportunity laws because the amounts paid by our new representatives to us: (i) are less than the minimum thresholds set by many state statutes and (ii) are not fees paid for the right to participate in a business, but rather are for bona fide expenses such as state-required insurance examinations and pre-licensing training. We have not been, and are not currently, subject to franchise laws for similar reasons. However, there is a risk that a governmental agency or court could disagree with our assessment or that these laws and regulations could change. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") recently finalized a new Business Opportunity Rule. We do not believe that the FTC's Business Opportunity Rule applies to our company.  However, it could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Becoming subject to business opportunity or franchise laws or regulations could require us to provide certain disclosures and regulate the manner in which we recruit our sales representatives that may increase the expense of, or adversely impact our success in, recruiting new sales representatives and make it more difficult for us to successfully attract and recruit new sales representatives. There are various laws and regulations that prohibit fraudulent or deceptive schemes known as pyramid schemes. In general, a pyramid scheme is defined as an arrangement in which new participants are required to pay a fee to participate in the organization and then receive compensation primarily for recruiting other persons to participate, either directly or through sales of goods or services that are merely disguised payments for recruiting others. The application of these laws and regulations to a given set of business practices is inherently fact-based and, therefore, is subject to interpretation by applicable enforcement authorities. Our representatives are paid by commissions based on sales of our products and services to bona fide purchasers, and for this and other reasons we do not believe that we are subject to laws regulating pyramid schemes. Moreover, our representatives are not required to purchase any of the products marketed by us. However, even though we believe that our distribution practices are currently in compliance with, or exempt from, these laws and regulations, there is a risk that a governmental agency or court could disagree with our assessment or that these laws and regulations could change, which may require us to cease our operations in certain jurisdictions or result in other costs or fines. There are also federal, state and provincial laws of general application, such as the FTC Act, and state or provincial unfair and deceptive trade practices laws that could potentially be invoked to challenge aspects of our recruiting of sales representatives and compensation practices. In particular, our recruiting efforts include promotional materials for recruits 22Table of Contentsthat describe the potential opportunity available to them if they join our sales force. These materials, as well as our other recruiting efforts and those of our sales representatives, are subject to scrutiny by the FTC and state and provincial enforcement authorities with respect to misleading statements, including misleading earnings claims made to convince potential new recruits to join our sales force. If claims made by us or by our sales representatives are deemed to be misleading, it could result in violations of the FTC Act or comparable state and provincial statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices or result in reputational harm. Being subject to, or out of compliance with, the aforementioned laws and regulations could require us to change our distribution structure, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.There may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of our sales representatives is successfully challenged.  Our sales representatives are independent contractors who operate their own businesses. In the past, we have been successful in defending our company in various contexts before courts and governmental agencies against claims that our sales representatives should be treated like employees. Although we believe that we have properly classified our representatives as independent contractors, there is nevertheless a risk that the IRS or another authority will take a different view. Furthermore, the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent sales representatives are subject to change or interpretation by various authorities. The classification of workers as independent contractors has been the subject of federal legislative and regulatory interest over the last several years, with proposals being made that call for greater scrutiny of independent contractor classifications and greater penalties for companies who wrongly classify workers as independent contractors instead of employees.  Thus far, none of these proposals has been enacted by the federal government.  In July 2011, the DOL issued a statement in which it announced its intention to pursue rulemaking under the Fair Labor Standards Act referred to as “Right to Know” that would require companies utilizing independent contractors to make disclosures to the independent contractors regarding their classification as such and the rationale supporting the classification, as well as a description of their rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act.  In September 2011, the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives released a draft funding bill for fiscal 2012 for the DOL that would, if enacted, prohibit the DOL from using any of its funding to develop or promulgate the “Right to Know” rule being considered by the DOL.  We cannot predict the outcome of these legislative and regulatory efforts, but the topic of independent contractor classification seems likely to remain active.   If a federal, state or provincial authority enacts legislation or adopts regulations that change the manner in which employees and independent contractors are classified or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws and regulations, including in respect of tax withholding, social security payments and recordkeeping, or we may be required to modify our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with federal, state, or provincial tax or employment laws or with respect to any applicable employee benefit plan. Our or our sales representatives' violation of, or non-compliance with, laws and regulations and the related claims and proceedings could expose us to material liabilities. Extensive federal, state, provincial and territorial laws regulate our products and our relationships with our clients, imposing certain requirements that our sales representatives must follow. The laws and regulations applicable to our business include those promulgated by FINRA, the SEC, the MSRB, the FTC and state insurance and securities regulatory agencies in the United States. In Canada, our business is regulated by OSFI, FINTRAC, FCAC, MFDA, and provincial and territorial insurance regulators and provincial and territorial securities regulators. At any given time, we may have pending state, federal or provincial examinations or inquiries of our investment and savings products and insurance businesses. In addition to imposing requirements that representatives must follow in their dealings with clients, these laws and regulations generally require us to maintain a system of supervision to attempt to ensure that our sales representatives comply with the requirements to which they are subject. We have developed policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations. However, despite these compliance and supervisory efforts, the breadth of our operations and the broad regulatory requirements could result in oversight failures and instances of non-compliance or misconduct on the part of our sales representatives. 23Table of ContentsFrom time to time, we are subject to private litigation as a result of alleged misconduct by our sales representatives. Examples include claims that a sales representative's failure to disclose underwriting-related information regarding the insured on an insurance application resulted in the denial of a life insurance policy claim, and with respect to investment and savings products sales, errors or omissions that a representative made in connection with an account. In addition to the potential for non-compliance with laws or misconduct applicable to our existing product offerings, we could experience similar regulatory issues or litigation with respect to new products, such as fixed annuities or our managed accounts products.  Non-compliance or misconduct by our sales representatives could result in adverse findings in either examinations or litigation and could subject us to sanctions, monetary liabilities, restrictions on or the loss of the operation of our business, claims against us or reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to protect the confidentiality of client information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Pursuant to federal laws, various federal agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, most states and some provinces have enacted laws, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. Many of our sales representatives and employees have access to, and routinely process, personal information of clients through a variety of media, including the Internet and software applications. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, our company, our employees and our sales representatives. It is possible that a sales representative or employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if our sales representatives or employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Insurance Business and ReinsuranceWe may face significant losses if our actual experience differs from our expectations regarding mortality or persistency. We set prices for life insurance policies based upon expected claim payment patterns derived from assumptions we make about the mortality rates, or likelihood of death, of our policyholders in any given year. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual mortality rates compare to our pricing assumptions. For example, if mortality rates are higher than those assumed in our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make more death benefit payments under our life insurance policies or to make such payments sooner than we had projected, which may decrease the profitability of our term life insurance products and result in an increase in the cost of our subsequent reinsurance transactions. The prices and expected future profitability of our life insurance products are also based, in part, upon assumptions related to persistency. Actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse effect on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy. Actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse effect on profitability in the later years of a block of policies because the anticipated claims experience is higher in these later years. If actual persistency is significantly different from that assumed in our pricing assumptions, our reserves for future policy benefits may prove to be inadequate. We are precluded from adjusting premiums on our in-force business during the initial term of the policies, and our ability to adjust premiums on in-force business after the initial policy term is limited to the maximum premium rates in the policy. Our assumptions and estimates regarding mortality and persistency require us to make numerous judgments and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the actual persistency or ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claim payments on a block of policies, the timing of those payments, or whether the assets supporting these contingent future payment obligations will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of claims. If we conclude that our reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover actual or expected claims payments and the scheduled amortization of our deferred policy acquisition costs (""DAC"") assets, we would be required to first accelerate our amortization of the DAC assets and then increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and 24Table of Contentsresults of operations. The occurrence of a catastrophic event could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events, which could cause a large number of premature deaths of our insureds. A catastrophic event could also cause significant volatility in global financial markets and disrupt the economy. Although we have ceded a significant majority of our mortality risk to reinsurers since the mid-1990s, a catastrophic event could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims resulting from a catastrophic event could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any quarter or year and could also materially harm the financial condition of our reinsurers, which would increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new business could also be adversely affected. In addition, most of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business require life insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which raise funds to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed issuers. It is possible that a catastrophic event could require extraordinary assessments on our insurance companies, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance business is highly regulated, and statutory and regulatory changes may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Life insurance statutes and regulations are generally designed to protect the interests of the public and policyholders. Those interests may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. Currently, in the United States, the power to regulate insurance resides almost exclusively with the states. The laws of the various U.S. jurisdictions grant state insurance regulators broad powers to regulate almost all aspects of our insurance business. Much of this state regulation follows model statutes or regulations developed or amended by the NAIC, which is composed of the insurance commissioners of each U.S. jurisdiction. The NAIC re-examines and amends existing model laws and regulations (including holding company regulations) in addition to determining whether new ones are needed. The U.S. Congress continues to examine the current condition of U.S. state-based insurance regulation to determine whether to impose federal regulation and to allow optional federal insurance company incorporation. The Dodd-Frank Act created an Office of Federal Insurance Reform that was authorized to, among other things, study methods to modernize and improve insurance regulation, including uniformity and the feasibility of federal regulation. We cannot predict with certainty whether, or in what form, reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will materially affect our business. Changes in federal statutes, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, financial services regulation and federal taxation, in addition to changes to state statutes and regulations, may be more restrictive than current requirements or may result in higher costs, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provincial and federal insurance laws regulate all aspects of our Canadian insurance business. Changes to provincial or federal statutes and regulations may be more restrictive than current requirements or may result in higher costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have also entered into an undertaking agreement with OSFI in connection with the IPO and our corporate reorganization pursuant to which we have agreed to provide OSFI certain information, including advance notice, where practicable, of certain corporate actions. If we fail to comply with our undertaking to OSFI, or if OSFI determines that our corporate actions do not comply with applicable Canadian law, Primerica Life Canada could face sanctions or fines, and Primerica Life Canada could be subject to increased capital requirements or other requirements deemed appropriate by OSFI. We received approval from the Minister of Finance (Canada) under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada) in connection with our indirect acquisition of Primerica Life Canada. The Minister expects that a person controlling a federal insurance company will provide ongoing financial, managerial or operational support to its subsidiary should such support prove necessary, and has required us to sign a support principle letter to that effect. This ongoing support may take the form of additional capital, the provision of managerial expertise or the provision of support in such areas as risk management, internal control systems and training. However, the letter does not create a legal obligation on the part of the person to provide the support. In the event that OSFI determines Primerica Life Canada is not receiving adequate support from us under applicable Canadian law, Primerica Life Canada may be subject to increased capital requirements or other requirements deemed appropriate by OSFI. 25Table of ContentsIf there were to be extraordinary changes to statutory or regulatory requirements in the United States or Canada, we may be unable to fully comply with or maintain all required insurance licenses and approvals. Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have all requisite licenses and approvals, or do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our insurance activities or impose fines or penalties on us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation or regulatory initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. A decline in the regulatory capital ratios of our insurance subsidiaries could result in increased scrutiny by insurance regulators and ratings agencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to RBC standards (imposed under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of domicile. The RBC formula for U.S. life insurance companies generally establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to report their results of RBC calculations annually to the applicable state department of insurance and the NAIC. Our Canadian life insurance subsidiary is subject to minimum continuing capital and surplus requirements (“MCCSR”), and Tier 1 capital ratio requirements, and is required to provide its MCCSR and Tier 1 capital ratio calculations to the Canadian regulators. The capitalization of our insurance subsidiaries is maintained at levels in excess of the effective minimum requirements of the NAIC in the United States and OSFI in Canada. In any particular year, statutory capital and surplus amounts and RBC and MCCSR ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which is sensitive to equity and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in their reserve requirements, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in their investment portfolios, the credit ratings of investments held in their portfolios, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates, credit market volatility, changes in consumer behavior, as well as changes to the NAIC's RBC formula or the MCCSR calculation of OSFI. Many of these factors are outside of our control. Our financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC and MCCSR ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. Ratings agencies may change their internal models, effectively increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to maintain their current ratings. In addition, ratings agencies may downgrade the invested assets held in our portfolio, which could result in a reduction of their capital and surplus. Changes in statutory accounting principles could also adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries' ability to meet minimum RBC, MCCSR and statutory capital and surplus requirements. There is no assurance that our insurance subsidiaries will not need additional capital or, if needed, that we will be able to provide it to maintain the targeted RBC and MCCSR levels to support their business operations. The failure of any of our insurance subsidiaries to meet its applicable RBC and MCCSR requirements or minimum capital and surplus requirements could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed by insurance regulators, including limitations on its ability to write additional business, supervision by regulators or seizure or liquidation. Any corrective action imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A decline in RBC or MCCSR also limits the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions and could be a factor in causing ratings agencies to downgrade the financial strength ratings of all our insurance subsidiaries. Such downgrades would have an adverse effect on our ability to write new insurance business and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A ratings downgrade by a ratings organization could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Each of our insurance subsidiaries has been assigned a financial strength rating by A.M. Best. Primerica Life currently also has an insurer financial strength rating from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. NBLIC and Primerica Life Canada are not rated by Standard & Poor's, Moody's or Fitch. The financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic review using, among other things, the ratings agencies' proprietary capital adequacy models, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and are not intended for the protection of stockholders or as a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities. Our financial strength ratings will affect our competitive position relative to other insurance companies. If the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 26Table of Contentsfall below certain levels, some of our policyholders may move their business to our competitors.  In addition, the models used by ratings agencies to determine financial strength are different from the capital requirements set by insurance regulators.Ratings organizations review the financial performance and financial conditions of insurance companies, and provide opinions regarding financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders. A downgrade in the financial strength ratings of any of our insurance subsidiaries, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including by: •reducing sales of insurance products; •adversely affecting our relationships with our sales representatives; •materially increasing the amount of policy cancellations by our policyholders; •requiring us to reduce prices to remain competitive; and •adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all. If the rating agencies or regulators change their approach to financial strength ratings and statutory capital requirements, we may need to take action to maintain current ratings and capital adequacy ratios, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, the Parent Company currently has investment grade credit ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and A.M. Best for the senior unsecured debt that it may elect to offer pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement at some point in the future. These ratings are indicators of a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations and are important factors in its ability to access liquidity in the debt markets.  A rating downgrade by a rating agency can occur at any time if the rating agency perceives an adverse change in our financial condition, results of operations or ability to service debt. If such a downgrade occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including adversely limiting our access to capital in the unsecured debt market and potentially increasing the cost of such debt.Credit deterioration in, and the effects of interest rate fluctuations on, our invested asset portfolio could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.A large percentage of our invested asset portfolio is invested in fixed-income securities. As a result, credit deterioration and interest rate fluctuations could materially affect the value and earnings of our invested asset portfolio. Fixed-income securities decline in value if there is no active trading market for the securities or the market's impression of, or the ratings agencies' views on, the credit quality of an issuer worsens. During periods of declining market interest rates, any interest income we receive on variable interest rate investments would decrease and we would be forced to invest the cash we receive as interest, return of principal on our investments and cash from operations in lower-yielding, high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of fixed-income securities could also decide to prepay their obligations to borrow at lower market rates, which would increase our reinvestment risk. If interest rates generally increase, the market value of our fixed rate income portfolio decreases. Additionally, if the market value of any security in our invested asset portfolio decreases, we may realize losses if we deem the value of the security to be other-than-temporarily impaired. To the extent that any fluctuations in fair value or interest rates are significant or we recognize impairments that are material, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Valuation of our investments and the determination of whether a decline in the fair value of our invested assets is other-than-temporary are based on methodologies and estimates that may prove to be incorrect. U.S. GAAP requires that when the fair value of any of our invested assets declines and such decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we recognize a loss in either accumulated other comprehensive income or on our statement of income based on certain criteria in the period that such determination is made. Determining the fair value of certain invested assets, particularly those that do not trade on a regular basis, requires an assessment of available data and the use of assumptions and estimates. Once it is determined that the fair value of an asset is below its carrying value, we must determine whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, which is based on subjective factors and involves a variety of assumptions and estimates. There are certain risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in market value are other-than-temporary. These include significant changes in general economic conditions and business markets, trends in certain 27Table of Contentsindustry segments, interest rate fluctuations, rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and assumptions and legislative actions. In the case of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, there is added uncertainty as to the performance of the underlying collateral assets. To the extent that we are incorrect in our determination of the fair value of our investment securities or our determination that a decline in their value is other-than-temporary, we may realize losses that never actually materialize or may fail to recognize losses within the appropriate reporting period.The failure by any of our reinsurers to perform its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We extensively use reinsurance in the United States to diversify our risk and to manage our loss exposure to mortality risk. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. We, as the insurer, are required to pay the full amount of death benefits even in circumstances where we are entitled to receive payments from the reinsurer. Due to factors such as insolvency, adverse underwriting results or inadequate investment returns, our reinsurers may not be able to pay the amounts they owe us on a timely basis or at all.  Further, reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them or might delay payment. Since death benefit claims may be paid long after a policy is issued, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we can recover amounts to which we are entitled. Any such failure to pay by our reinsurers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The failure by the affiliates of Citi who are parties to the Citi reinsurance transactions to perform their obligations to us under our coinsurance agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Immediately prior to the IPO, we entered into four coinsurance agreements with three reinsurer affiliates of Citi pursuant to which we ceded between 80% and 90% of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year-end 2009. Under this arrangement, our current third-party reinsurance agreements remain in place. The largest of these transactions involved two coinsurance agreements between Primerica Life and Prime Reinsurance Company, Inc. (""Prime Re""), then a wholly owned subsidiary of Primerica Life.  Pursuant to these reinsurance agreements, we distributed to Citi all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Prime Re.  Prime Re was formed solely for the purpose of entering into these reinsurance transactions, had no operating history at the time the coinsurance agreements were executed and does not possess a financial strength rating from any rating agency. The other transactions were between (i) Primerica Life Canada and Financial Reassurance Company 2010 Ltd., a Bermuda reinsurer and wholly owned subsidiary of Citi, formed to operate solely for the purpose of reinsuring Citi-related risks and (ii) NBLIC and American Health and Life Insurance Company (“AHL”), a wholly owned insurance subsidiary of Citi that has a financial strength rating of “A” by A.M. Best. Each of the three reinsurers entered into trust agreements with our respective insurance subsidiaries and a trustee pursuant to which the reinsurer placed assets (primarily treasury and fixed-income securities) in trust for such subsidiary's benefit to secure the reinsurer's obligations to such subsidiary. Each such coinsurance agreement requires each reinsurer to maintain assets in trust sufficient to give the subsidiary full credit for regulatory purposes for the insurance, which amount will not be less than the amount of the reserves for the reinsured liabilities. In addition, in the case of the reinsurance transactions between Prime Re and Primerica Life, Citi has agreed in a capital maintenance agreement to maintain Prime Re's RBC above a specified minimum level, subject to a maximum amount being contributed by Citi. In the case of the reinsurance transaction between NBLIC and AHL, Citi has agreed to over-collateralize the assets in the trust for NBLIC for the life of the coinsurance agreement between NBLIC and AHL. Furthermore, our insurance subsidiaries have the right to recapture the business upon the occurrence of an event of default under their respective coinsurance agreement with the Citi affiliates subject to any applicable cure periods. An event of default includes: (1) a reinsurer insolvency, (2) failure through the fault of the reinsurer to provide full statutory financial statement credit for the reinsurance ceded, (3) a material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty by the reinsurer, (4) failure by the reinsurer to fund the trust account required to be established under the coinsurance agreements in any material respects, or (5) in connection with the coinsurance agreements with Prime Re, failure by Citi to maintain sufficient capital in the reinsurer, pursuant to the capital maintenance agreement between Citi and the reinsurer within 45 calendar days of any demand for payment by or on behalf of Primerica Life, and any 45-day extension thereof as consented to by Primerica Life, which consent may not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld, for a total of not more than 90 days to obtain such consent; provided that Primerica Life is not required to consent to extend such period beyond an additional 45 days. While any such recapture would be at no cost to us, such recapture would result in a substantial increase in our insurance exposure and require us to be fully responsible for the management of the assets set aside to support statutory reserves. The type of assets we might obtain as a result of a recapture may not be as liquid as our current invested asset portfolio and could result in an unfavorable impact on our risk profile. There is no assurance that the relevant Citi reinsurer will pay the reinsurance obligations owed to us now or in the future 28Table of Contentsor that it will pay these obligations on a timely basis. Notwithstanding the capital maintenance agreement between Prime Re and Citi and the initial over-collateralization of assets in trust for the benefit of our insurance companies, if any of our Citi reinsurers becomes insolvent, the amount in the trust account to support the obligations of such reinsurer is insufficient to pay such reinsurer's obligations to us and we fail to enforce our right to recapture the business, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in accounting for DAC of insurance entities will accelerate the recognition for certain acquisition costs not deemed to be directly related to the successful acquisition of new insurance contracts. In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the ""FASB""), issued ASU 2010-26, Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts (""ASU 2010-26""). The update revises the definition of DAC to reflect incremental costs directly related to the successful acquisition of new and renewed insurance contracts. The update creates a more limited definition than the current guidance, which defines DAC as those costs that vary with, and primarily relate to, the acquisition of insurance contracts. The revised definition materially increases the portion of acquisition costs being expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized over the lives of the underlying policies. The update allows either prospective or retrospective adoption and is required to be adopted for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2012. We plan to adopt this update retrospectively. We estimate that the adoption will result in a reduction to our DAC asset in the range of approximately $140 million to $160 million as of December 31, 2011.  We further estimate that it will reduce income before income taxes in the range of approximately $27 million to $33 million.  The related analysis and implementation of this accounting change is ongoing and may result in a different impact that is higher or lower than these anticipated ranges, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Investments and Savings Products BusinessOur investment and savings products segment is heavily dependent on mutual fund and annuity products offered by a relatively small number of companies and if these products fail to remain competitive with other investment options or we lose our relationship with one or more of these fund companies or with the source of our annuity products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.We earn a significant portion of our earnings through our relationships with a small group of mutual fund companies. A decision by one or more of these companies to alter or discontinue their current arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any of our investment and savings products fail to achieve satisfactory investment performance, our clients may seek higher yielding alternative investment products and we could experience higher redemption rates. In such circumstances, we may also experience re-allocations of existing client assets and increased allocations of new assets to investment and savings products with higher investment returns, which ultimately results in changes in our mix of business. Since different investment and savings products have different revenue and expense characteristics, such changes could have significant negative consequences for us. In recent years there has been an increase in the popularity of alternative investments, which we do not currently offer, principally index funds and exchange traded funds. These investment options typically have low fee structures and provide some of the attributes of mutual funds, such as risk diversification. If these products continue to gain traction among our client base as viable alternatives to mutual fund investments, our investment and savings products revenues could decline. In addition to sales commissions and asset-based compensation, a significant portion of our earnings from investment and savings products comes from recordkeeping services that we provide to third parties and from fees earned for custodial services that we provide to clients with retirement plan accounts in the funds of these mutual fund companies. We also receive revenue sharing payments from each of these mutual fund companies. A decision by one or more of these fund companies to alter or discontinue their current arrangements with us would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.29Table of ContentsOur or our securities-licensed sales representatives violations of, or non-compliance with, laws and regulations could expose us to material liabilities.Our subsidiary broker-dealer and registered investment advisor, PFS Investments, is subject to federal and state regulation of its securities business.  These regulations cover sales practices, trade suitability, supervision of registered representatives, recordkeeping, the conduct and qualification of officers and employees, the rules and regulations of the MSRB and state blue sky regulation. Investment advisory representatives are generally held to a higher standard of conduct than registered representatives.  Our subsidiary, PSS, is a registered transfer agent engaged in the recordkeeping business and is subject to SEC regulation. Violations of laws or regulations applicable to the activities of PFS Investments or PSS, or violations by a third party with which PFS Investments or PSS contracts which improperly performs its task, could subject us to disciplinary actions and could result in the imposition of cease and desist orders, fines or censures, restitution to clients, disciplinary actions, including the potential suspension or revocation of its license by the SEC, or the suspension or expulsion from FINRA and reputational damage, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our Canadian dealer subsidiary, PFSL Investments Canada and its sales representatives are subject to the securities laws of the provinces and territories of Canada in which we sell our mutual fund products and those of third parties and to the rules of the MFDA, the self-regulatory organization governing mutual fund dealers. PFSL Investments Canada is subject to periodic review by both the MFDA and the provincial and territorial securities commissions to assess its compliance with, among other things, applicable capital requirements and sales practices and procedures. These regulators have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business for failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations. Possible sanctions that could be imposed include the suspension of individual sales representatives, limitations on the activities in which the dealer may engage, suspension or revocation of the dealer registration, censure or fines, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If heightened standards of conduct or more stringent licensing requirements, such as those recently proposed by the SEC and proposed and withdrawn by the DOL, are imposed on us or our sales representatives or selling compensation is reduced as a result of new legislation or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our U.S. sales representatives are subject to federal and state regulation as well as state licensing requirements. PFS Investments, which is regulated as a broker-dealer, and our U.S. sales representatives are currently subject to general anti-fraud limitations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") and SEC rules and regulations, as well as other conduct standards prescribed by FINRA. These standards generally require that broker-dealers and their sales representatives disclose conflicts of interest that might affect the advice or recommendations they provide and require them to make suitable investment recommendations to their customers. The Dodd-Frank Act, which gives the SEC the power to impose on broker-dealers a heightened standard of conduct that is currently applicable only to investment advisers, requires the SEC to conduct a study to evaluate the effectiveness of the current legal standards of conduct for those that provide personalized investment advice regarding securities to retail customers. In 2010, the SEC staff submitted a report to Congress in which it recommended that the SEC adopt a uniform fiduciary standard of conduct.  The timing of any future rulemaking is unclear. In October 2010, the DOL published the DOL Proposed Rule, which would more broadly define the circumstances under which a person or entity may be considered a fiduciary for purposes of the prohibited transaction rules of IRC Section 4975. IRC Section 4975 prohibits certain types of compensation paid by third parties with respect to transactions involving assets in qualified accounts, including IRAs. In September 2011, the DOL withdrew the DOL Proposed Rule, but has indicated that it will re-propose a similar fiduciary rule in early 2012. If PFS Investments and its securities-licensed representatives are deemed to be fiduciaries under a rule similar to the DOL Proposed Rule, our ability to receive and retain certain types of compensation paid by third parties with respect to both new and existing assets in qualified accounts could be significantly limited.  IRAs and other qualified accounts are a core component of the Investment and Savings Products segment of our business and accounted for a significant portion of the total revenue of this segment for the year ended December 31, 2011. Thus, if a fiduciary rule similar to the DOL Proposed Rule is re-proposed and adopted, we would expect to substantially restructure our current business model for qualified accounts. Such restructuring could make it significantly more difficult for us and our representatives to profitably serve the middle-income market and could result in a significant reduction in the number of IRAs and qualified accounts that we serve, which could materially adversely affect the amount 30Table of Contentsof revenue that we generate from this line of business and ultimately could result in a decline in the number of our securities-licensed representatives.  Furthermore, our licensed representatives could be required to obtain additional securities licenses, which they may not be willing or able to obtain. The form, substance and timing of any re-proposed or final rule are unknown at this time. It is possible that a rule could be adopted in a form that does not materially adversely affect us. If re-proposed and adopted in the form initially proposed, however, the DOL Proposed Rule could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Heightened standards of conduct as a result of either of the above proposals or another similar proposed rule or regulation could also increase the compliance and regulatory burdens on our representatives, and could lead to increased litigation and regulatory risks, changes to our business model, a decrease in the number of our securities-licensed representatives and a reduction in the products we offer to our clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our suitability policies and procedures were deemed inadequate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We review the account applications that we receive for our investment and savings products for suitability. While we believe that the policies and procedures we implemented to help our sales representatives assist clients in making appropriate and suitable investment choices are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, it is possible that the SEC, FINRA or MFDA may not agree. Further, we could be subject to regulatory actions or private litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our sales force support tools may fail to appropriately identify suitable investment products.  Our support tools are designed to educate clients, help identify their financial needs, and introduce the potential benefits of our products. There could be a risk that the assumptions and methods of analyses embedded in our support tools could be successfully challenged and subject us to regulatory action or private litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Non-compliance with applicable regulations could lead to revocation of our subsidiary's status as a non-bank custodian.  PFS Investments is a non-bank custodian of retirement accounts, as permitted under Treasury Regulation 1.408-2. A non-bank custodian is an entity that is not a bank and that is permitted by the IRS to act as a custodian for retirement plan account assets of our clients. The IRS retains authority to revoke or suspend that status if it finds that PFS Investments is unwilling or unable to administer retirement accounts in a manner consistent with the requirements of the applicable regulations. Revocation of PFS Investments' non-bank custodian status would affect its ability to earn revenue for providing such services and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure of our agents to become licensed to offer our managed accounts program could adversely affect our investments business.  In 2011, PFS Investments became an SEC-registered investment adviser and, under the name Primerica Advisors, began offering a mutual fund advisory program.  In most states, our representatives are required to obtain an additional license to offer this program.  If a significant number of our representatives who are required to obtain such additional licenses to offer this program fail to do so, then the revenue and earnings we generate from this business could be materially adversely affected.  31Table of ContentsOther Risks Related to Our BusinessWe may be exposed to regulatory liabilities in connection with the wind-down of our U.S. mortgage business.Primerica Mortgages ceased its loan brokering activities in all states in which it held licenses effective December 31, 2011.  Accordingly, we have instructed our sales force to cease offering loan products on behalf of Primerica Mortgages in the United States from and after January 1, 2012.  We anticipate that all loan requests which were pending as of December 31, 2011 will be processed by the end of the first quarter of 2012.  As of January 1, 2012, Primerica Mortgages commenced the process of surrendering its state licenses so that it may completely exit the loan brokering business in the United States. Although Primerica Mortgages is no longer engaged in offering loan products, it and other Primerica companies could be subject to potential regulatory or other liability for violations of state or federal laws governing the loan industry if our sales representatives engage in misconduct while continuing to conduct the mortgage loan brokering business as an outside business activity.Changes in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and could adversely impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. U.S. GAAP continues to evolve and, as a result, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to anticipate and implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the FASB's current insurance contracts project could, among other things, significantly change the way we measure insurance liabilities on our balance sheet and the way we present earnings on our statement of income. This project, in addition to a related proposal to modify how to account for insurance contracts under IFRS, could adversely impact both our financial condition and results of operations as reported on a U.S. GAAP basis as well as our statutory capital calculations. The effects of economic down cycles in the United States and Canada could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been materially adversely affected by the economic downturn in the United States and Canada and the slow recovery that has occurred since the last half of 2009. This economic downturn, which has been characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower valuation of retirement savings accounts, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, has adversely affected the demand for the term life insurance, investment and other financial products that we sell. Future economic down cycles could severely adversely affect new sales and cause clients to liquidate mutual funds and other investments sold by our sales representatives. This could cause a decrease in the asset value of client accounts, reduce our trailing commission revenues and result in other-than-temporary-impairments in our invested asset portfolio. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of lapses or surrenders of insurance policies, and some of our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Further, volatility in equity markets or downturns could discourage purchases of the investment products that we distribute and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, including our ability to recruit and retain sales representatives. If credit markets remain tight for a prolonged period, our liquidity will be more limited than it otherwise would have been, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.We are subject to various federal laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, changes in which or violations of which may require us to alter our business practices and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In the United States, we are subject to many regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations, including Regulation S-P, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the FTC Act, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. We are also subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, which requires us to develop and implement customer identification and risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report suspicious activity and maintain certain records. We are also required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control that prohibit or restrict transactions with suspected countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals. 32Table of ContentsIn Canada, we are subject to provincial and territorial regulations, including consumer protection legislation that pertains to unfair and misleading business practices, provincial and territorial credit reporting legislation that provides requirements in respect of obtaining credit bureau reports and providing notices of decline, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Competition Act, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the Telecommunications Act and certain Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Telecom Decisions in respect of unsolicited telecommunications. We are also subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and its accompanying regulations, which require us to develop and implement money laundering policies and procedures relating to customer indemnification, reporting and recordkeeping, develop and maintain ongoing training programs for employees, perform a risk assessment on our business and clients and institute and document a review of our anti-money laundering program at least once every two years. We are also required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions and legislation that prohibit us from, among other things, engaging in transactions with, and providing services to, persons on lists created under various federal statutes and regulations and blocked persons and foreign countries and territories subject to Canadian sanctions administered by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada and the Department of Public Safety Canada. Changes in, or violations of, any of these laws or regulations may require additional compliance procedures, or result in enforcement proceedings, sanctions or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation and regulatory investigations and actions may result in financial losses and harm our reputation. We face a risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses. From time to time, we are subject to private litigation and regulatory investigations as a result of sales representative misconduct. In addition, we may become subject to lawsuits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, payment of improper sales commissions, claims issues, product design and disclosure, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, pricing and sales practices issues. Life insurance companies have historically been subject to substantial litigation resulting from policy disputes and other matters. If we become subject to similar litigation, any judgment or settlement of such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities. For example, we have a large sales force, and we could face claims by some of our sales representatives arising out of their relationship with us. We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas and books and record examinations, from state, provincial and federal regulators and other authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in any litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm and we could incur significant legal expenses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current legislative and regulatory climate with regard to financial services may adversely affect our operations. The volume of legislative and regulatory activity relating to financial services has increased substantially in recent years, including with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act could cause sweeping changes in the consumer financial services industry. We anticipate that the level of enforcement actions and investigations by federal regulators will increase correspondingly. The same factors that have contributed to legislative, regulatory and enforcement activity at the federal level are likely to contribute to heightened activity at the state and provincial level. If we or our sales representatives become subject to new requirements or regulations, it could result in increased litigation, regulatory risks, changes to our business model, a decrease in the number of our securities-licensed representatives or a reduction in the products we offer to our clients or the profits we earn, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 33Table of ContentsThe inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us in sufficient amounts would impede our ability to meet our obligations.We are a holding company, and we have no significant operations. Our primary asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries and our primary liability is the Citi note. We rely primarily on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet our operating costs and other corporate expenses, as well as to pay dividends to our stockholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us depends on their earnings, covenants contained in existing and future financing or other agreements and on regulatory restrictions. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends will further depend on their statutory income and surplus. If the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payments and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund our obligations or if a subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of equity or the sale of assets. However, given the recent volatility in the capital markets, there is no assurance that we would be able to raise cash by these means. The jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us. In the United States, these restrictions are based, in part, on the prior year's statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior approval. Dividends in larger amounts are subject to approval by the insurance commissioner of the state of domicile. In Canada, dividends can be paid, subject to the paying insurance company continuing to meet the regulatory requirements for capital adequacy and liquidity and upon 15 days' minimum notice to OSFI. No assurance is given that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, and such restrictions could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to us by our subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, in the future, we may become subject to debt instruments or other agreements that limit our ability to pay dividends. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also limited by our need to maintain the financial strength ratings assigned to us by the ratings agencies. If any of our subsidiaries were to become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, we, as sole stockholder, will have no right to proceed against the assets of that subsidiary. Furthermore, with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, we, as sole stockholder, will have no right to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under the applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws, although, in Canada, we could apply for permission to cause liquidation. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary. The insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors of the subsidiary and policyholders (if an insurance subsidiary) would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiary's assets before we, as the sole stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary, which could adversely affect our ability to pay our operating costs and other corporate expenses. If the ability of our insurance or non-insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, bankruptcy or insolvency, or our need to maintain our financial strength ratings, or is limited due to operating results or other factors, it could materially adversely affect our ability to pay our operating costs and other corporate expenses.We may not be able to raise capital through debt or equity offerings if needed to meet our operating and regulatory capital requirements or for other purposes.Historically, we have funded our new business capital needs from cash flows provided by premiums paid on our in-force book of term life insurance policies. As a result of the Citi reinsurance transactions, the net cash flow we retain from our existing block of term life insurance policies was reduced proportionately to the size of our retained interest. As we grow our term life insurance business by issuing new policies, we will need to fund all of the upfront cash requirements of issuing new term life policies (such as commissions payable to the sales force and underwriting expenses), which costs generally exceed premiums collected in a policy's first year. In light of these anticipated net cash outflows, there will be significant demands on our liquidity in the near- to intermediate-term as we grow the size of our retained block of term life insurance policies. Therefore, to meet our operating and regulatory requirements, we may incur debt or issue equity to fund working capital and capital expenditures or to make acquisitions and other investments. If we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred equity securities, any such debt securities or preferred equity securities issued will have liquidation rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If we raise funds through the issuance of equity securities, the issuance will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that debt or equity financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are not able to 34Table of Contentsobtain sufficient financing, we may be unable to maintain or grow our business. Our inability to refinance the Citi note with terms that are acceptable could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations. Prior to the completion of the IPO, we issued to Citi the $300.0 million Citi note. This note matures on March 31, 2015, and we are obligated under the terms of the Citi note to use commercially reasonable efforts to refinance it at certain mutually agreeable dates, based on certain conditions. As of December 31, 2011, the Parent Company had investment grade credit ratings from Moody's, Standard & Poor's and A.M. Best for the senior unsecured debt that it may elect to offer pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement at some time in the future.  Nonetheless, if we are unable to refinance the Citi note on reasonable economic terms, we may incur significantly higher interest expense or be unable to repay the Citi note in full upon maturity. A significant change in the competitive environment in which we operate could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.We face competition in all of our business lines. Our competitors include financial services companies, mutual fund companies, banks, investment management firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies and direct sales companies. In many of our product lines, we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do. A significant change in this competitive environment could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.The loss of key personnel could negatively affect our financial results and impair our ability to implement our business strategy. Our success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team. The efforts, personality and leadership of our senior management team have been, and will continue to be, critical to our success. The loss of service of our senior management team due to disability, death, retirement or some other cause could reduce our ability to successfully motivate our sales representatives and implement our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Messrs. John Addison and Rick Williams, our Co-Chief Executive Officers, are well regarded by our sales representatives and have substantial experience in our business and, therefore, are particularly important to our company. Although both Messrs. Addison and Williams, as well as our other senior executives, have entered into employment agreements with us, there is no assurance that they will complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration.In addition, the loss of key RVPs for any reason could negatively affect our financial results and could impair our ability to attract new sales representatives.  If one of our significant information technology systems fails, if its security is compromised or if the Internet becomes disabled or unavailable, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.  Our business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are centered on a mainframe platform supported by servers housed at our home office and back-up site. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions. Our information technology systems run a variety of third-party and proprietary software, including POL (our website portal to our sales force), our insurance administration system, Virtual Base Shop (our paperless office for RVPs), TurboApps (our point-of-sale data collection tool for product/ recruiting applications), our licensing decision and support system and our compensation system.Despite the implementation of security and back-up measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, viruses or other attacks, programming errors and similar disruptions. The failure of any one of these systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We retain confidential information in our information technology systems, and we rely on industry standard commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our information technology systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable client information and proprietary business information. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions require that 35Table of Contentsclients be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable client information. Any compromise of the security of our information technology systems that results in inappropriate disclosure or use of personally identifiable client information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses. In the event of a disaster, our business continuity plan may not be sufficient, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our infrastructure supports a combination of local and remote recovery solutions for business resumption in the event of a disaster. In the event of either a campus-wide destruction of all buildings or the inability to access our main campus in Duluth, Georgia, our business recovery plan provides for our employees to perform their work functions via a dedicated business recovery site located 25 miles from our main campus or by remote access from an employee's home. However, in the event of a full scale local or regional disaster, our business recovery plan may be inadequate, and our employees and sales representatives may be unable to carry out their work, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the United States dollar versus the Canadian dollar. A weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would result in lower levels of reported revenues, net income, assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income in our U.S. dollar financial statements. We have not historically hedged against this exposure. Significant exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Relationship With Warburg PincusIf Warburg Pincus sells a significant equity interest in our company to a third party in a private transaction, our stockholders may not realize any change-of-control premium on shares of our common stock that such party may receive and we may become subject to the influence of a presently unknown third party.Prior to the IPO, in February 2010, Citi entered into a securities purchase agreement with us and certain private equity funds managed by Warburg Pincus LLC (“Warburg Pincus”) pursuant to which, in mid-April 2010, Citi sold to Warburg Pincus 16,412,440 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase from us 4,103,110 additional shares of our common stock. As a result, Warburg Pincus owns a significant equity interest in our company.  Warburg Pincus has the ability, should it choose to do so, to sell some or all of its shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction. The ability of Warburg Pincus to privately sell its shares of our common stock, with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of the shares of our common stock, could prevent our other stockholders from realizing any change-of-control premium on their shares of our common stock that may otherwise accrue to Warburg Pincus upon its private sale of our common stock. Additionally, if Warburg Pincus privately sells a significant equity interest in our company, we may become subject to the influence of a presently unknown third party. Such third party may have conflicts of interest with those of other stockholders.  Warburg Pincus may be able to exert significant influence over us, which may result in conflicts of interest with us.As of December 31, 2011, Warburg Pincus owned approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock and has rights to acquire additional shares of our common stock pursuant to its exercise of warrants. Warburg Pincus is entitled to nominate two directors to serve on our board. However, for as long as Warburg Pincus owns a significant amount of our common stock, Warburg Pincus may be able to influence the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors. Under the provisions of the securities purchase agreement, the prior consent of Warburg Pincus will be required in connection with specified corporate actions by us. In addition, for so long as it owns a significant amount of our common stock, Warburg Pincus will be entitled to preemptive type rights to purchase equity securities issued or proposed to be issued by us, which may limit our ability to access capital from other sources in a timely manner.Because Warburg Pincus' interests may differ from those of our other stockholders, actions that Warburg Pincus may take with respect to us may not be as favorable to other stockholders as they are to Warburg Pincus.36Table of Contents"
