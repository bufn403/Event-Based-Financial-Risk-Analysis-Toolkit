BusinessOverview of the Company’s BusinessSterling Infrastructure, Inc. (“Sterling” or “the Company”) operates through a variety of subsidiaries within three segments specializing in E-Infrastructure, Transportation and Building Solutions in the United States, primarily across the Southern, Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Rocky Mountain regions and the Pacific Islands. E-Infrastructure Solutions provides advanced, large-scale site development services for manufacturing, data centers, e-commerce distribution centers, warehousing, power generation and more. Transportation Solutions includes infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airports, ports, rail and storm drainage systems. Building Solutions includes residential and commercial concrete foundations for single-family and multi-family homes, parking structures, elevated slabs, other concrete work, and plumbing services for new single-family residential builds. From strategy to operations, we are committed to sustainability by operating responsibly to safeguard and improve society’s quality of life. Caring for our people and our communities, our customers and our investors – that is The Sterling Way.In this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, “Sterling,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” means Sterling and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, references to “Note” or “Notes” refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K, unless indicated otherwise.Business StrategySince 2016, our strategic vision has been based on the following elements and objectives:Strategic ElementsStrategic ObjectivesSolidifying the baseRisk ReductionGrowing high margin products and servicesBottom-Line GrowthExpansion into adjacent marketsExceed Peer PerformanceBuild a Platform for Future Accretive GrowthSolidifying the base—The Company’s historic base business is our low-bid heavy highway projects within our Transportation Solutions segment. Heavy highway projects typically have gross margins of 7-8%; however, prior to 2016 our gross margin was approximately 4%. In 2016 we implemented a strategy to solidify this base business by improving bid discipline to significantly reduce the probability of project losses. Since the implementation of the strategy and application of the key objective, we have improved the heavy highway backlog gross margin to 11.3% at December 31, 2023, and we expect gross margins to increase further as we continue to execute our strategy.Growing high margin products and services—While solidifying the base is important to the profitability of the Company, the improvement of gross margins is limited due to the highly competitive bidding environment for heavy highway projects. In 2016, we implemented a strategy to shift our project mix from low-bid heavy highway projects to alternative delivery heavy highway projects and other higher margin work (e.g., airports, commercial, piling and shoring). In 2016, our low-bid heavy highway revenue was approximately 79% of our total revenue, but we have progressively lowered this to 15% as of December 31, 2023. The key objective in this strategic area is our focus on bottom-line growth, and the higher margin projects we target have gross margins in the range of 12%-15%.Expansion into adjacent markets—In 2016, we implemented a strategy to pursue growth through the acquisition of companies and assets that will enable us to expand into adjacent markets and broaden the types of projects we execute. We operate a decentralized, adaptive business model, which provides us with flexibility to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Our acquisition strategy has focused on businesses that can strengthen our current portfolio, enable us to expand into complementary categories or geographic regions or provide diversification of cash flows. The companies we target for acquisition typically have gross margins of 15% or more. This strategic focus allows us to broaden our portfolio of products and services, and broaden our end customer base to remain competitive in the markets where we operate. Since 2016, we have completed six acquisitions and plan to consider other strategic acquisitions in the future.Recent Strategic TransactionsMyers Disposition—On November 30, 2022, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) and sold the Company’s 50% ownership interest in its partnership with Myers & Sons Construction L.P. (“Myers”) for $18 million in cash. In accordance with the Agreement’s payment terms, the Company received two payments totaling $14 million in the first quarter of 2023 and two additional payments of $2 million each are due by the end of 2025 and 2027, respectively.  The disposition is consistent with the Company’s strategic shift to reduce its portfolio of low-bid heavy highway and water containment and 4treatment projects in order to reduce risk and improve the Company’s margins and to focus on its strategic geographies outside of California. This strategic shift had a major effect on our operations and consolidated financial results, and accordingly, the historical results of Myers have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to being disclosed as a discontinued operation, the results of Myers were included within our Transportation Solutions segment. See Note 4 - Dispositions for further discussion.CCS Acquisition—On December 20, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Concrete Construction Services of Arizona LLC and its affiliate, CCS Contracting Services LLC (collectively “CCS”), for a purchase price of approximately $21 million. CCS’s business provides concrete foundation services for residential single-family homes; this includes the preparation, pouring and finishing of post-tension concrete foundations for new housing subdivisions in the greater Phoenix, Arizona area. The results of CCS are included within our Building Solutions segment.PPG Acquisition—On November 16, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Professional Plumbers Group, Incorporated (“PPG”), a corporation headquartered in Wylie, Texas, near Dallas-Fort Worth, for a purchase price of approximately $57 million. PPG’s business provides services for all the major plumbing phases required for new single-family residential builds, which expands our suite of residential services in the Dallas-Fort Worth market to include the next critical phase of the build once the slab is complete. The results of PPG are included within our Building Solutions segment. See Note 3 - Acquisitions for further discussion.Segments, Markets and CustomersThe Company’s internal and public segment reporting are aligned based upon the services offered by its operating groups, which represent the reportable segments. The Company’s operations consist of three reportable segments: E-Infrastructure Solutions, Transportation Solutions and Building Solutions. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21 - Segment Information for further discussion of our business segments.E-Infrastructure Solutions—Our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment serves large, blue-chip end users in the e-commerce distribution center, data center, manufacturing, warehousing, and power generation sectors and more. We are a leading provider of large-scale site development services in the Southeastern, Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. Four customers accounted for 40% of the segment’s revenue in 2023, 35% in 2022 and 58% in 2021.    Transportation Solutions—Our Transportation Solutions segment is comprised of heavy highway, aviation and rail projects, and it relies heavily on federal and state infrastructure spending. The principal geographic markets of this segment are Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Texas, Utah and the Pacific Islands. Within these principal markets, our core customers are state Departments of Transportation (“DOT(s)”) and regional transit, airport, port, water and railroad authorities. Four state DOTs accounted for 50% of the segment’s revenue in 2023, 44% in 2022 and 42% in 2021.Building Solutions—Our Building Solutions segment is comprised of our residential and commercial businesses. The principal geographic market for our residential business is Texas, specifically Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and the surrounding communities. In 2021, we expanded our residential business into the greater Phoenix area and continued this expansion in 2022 with the acquisition of the CCS business. In 2023, we further expanded our services in the Dallas-Fort Worth market to include plumbing services for all the major plumbing phases required for new single-family residential builds with our acquisition of PPG. Our core residential customer base is comprised of leading national, regional and custom home builders. Our commercial business focuses on concrete construction of multi-family foundations, parking structures, elevated slabs and other concrete work for leading developers and general contractors in commercial markets. Four customers, including their respective affiliates, accounted for 42% of the segment’s revenue in 2023, 60% in 2022 and 57% in 2021.In 2023, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues; however we routinely construct projects for our largest customers mentioned above. The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Note 19 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures for information on the Company’s major customers that represent a concentration of risk due to their significant revenue contributions.CompetitionCompetition for our segments varies widely, from small local contractors to large international construction companies. We aim to position ourselves in the mid-level market, traditionally bidding on work too large for the small local contractors yet too small for the large national and international construction companies. However, should market conditions become less favorable, we would expect to see a convergence from both the small local contractors and large international construction companies into our targeted mid-level market. This convergence could increase competitive bidding pressure and reduce both 5revenue growth and margins. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” for further discussion of risks associated with our competitive environment.SeasonalityOperations for our segments are often affected by weather conditions, especially during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. These conditions may disrupt construction schedules and lead to variability in our revenues, profitability and the number of employees we require. For additional discussion regarding the potential impacts of seasonality on our business, see Item 1A “Risk Factors
.”ResourcesWe procure raw materials essential for the operation of our segments, such as, cement, aggregate, concrete, liquid asphalt, lumber, steel, and fuels, including diesel, gasoline, natural gas and propane, from a broad network of sources. Fluctuations in the price and availability of these raw materials may vary over time due to changes in market conditions and production capacities.Backlog    Our remaining performance obligations on our projects, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, do not differ from what we refer to as “Backlog.” Our Backlog represents the amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from our contract commitments on projects. The contracts in Backlog are typically completed in 6 to 36 months. The value of our Backlog was $2.07 billion at December 31, 2023, as compared to $1.41 billion at December 31, 2022. We exclude from our Backlog any contract where we are the apparent low bidder for projects (“Unsigned Awards”) until such contract is formally executed by the customer (approximately $303.2 million at December 31, 2023). Certain Building Solutions revenue is recognized upon completion at a point in time and therefore is never reflected in our Backlog. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Backlog” for a discussion and quantification of our Backlog. Also see Item 1A “Risk Factors
” for further discussion of risks related to Backlog.ContractsOur contracts are awarded on a competitively bid basis or negotiated bid basis using a range of contracting options, including fixed-unit price, lump sum and cost-reimbursable. Each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages. Typically, the Company assumes more risk with lump-sum contracts; however, these types of contracts can yield additional profits if the work is completed for less than originally estimated. Under fixed-unit price contracts, the Company’s profit may vary if actual labor-hour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates. Each contract is designed to optimize the balance between risk and reward. At December 31, 2023, substantially all of our Backlog was contracted on a fixed-unit price or lump sum basis. We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding or not included in the initial contract price. Also, because some contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs, the components of contract cost can impact profitability.Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain termination for convenience clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but would require that the Company be compensated for work performed through the date of termination and for additional contractual costs for cancellation. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our types of risk and how we mitigate cancellation and credit risk.Insurance and BondingOur buildings and equipment are covered by insurance, at levels our management believes to be adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability, excess liability, workers’ compensation and auto insurance all in amounts deemed consistent with our risk of loss and standard industry practice.As a normal part of the Transportation Solutions business and occasionally with the E-Infrastructure Solutions business, we are required to provide various types of surety and payment bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under the contract. Typically, a bidder for a contract must post a bid bond, generally for 5% to 10% of the bid amount, and upon being awarded the bid, must post a performance and payment bond for up to 100% of the costs to construct. Usually, upon posting of the performance bond, a contractor must also post a maintenance bond for generally 1% of the contract amount for one to two years. Our ability to obtain bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, aggregate contract size, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. 6Bonding companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our Backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. As is customary, we have agreed to indemnify our bonding company for all losses incurred by it in connection with bonds that are issued, and we have granted our bonding company a security interest in certain assets, including accounts receivable, as collateral for such obligation.Government and Environmental RegulationsOur operations must comply with various regulatory requirements imposed by federal, state and local agencies and authorities, including safety, wage and hour regulations and other labor issues, immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of our business. For example, our operations are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws directed toward the protection of employees. In addition, most of our Transportation Solutions construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional governmental requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses.All of our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges into air, water and land, climate change, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. For example, we must apply water or chemicals to reduce dust on road construction projects and to contain contaminants in storm run-off water at construction sites. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous wastes encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the customer. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) impose strict and retroactive joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances.CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur.Solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes, are subject to the requirements of the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. Although we do not generate solid waste, we occasionally dispose of solid waste on behalf of our customers. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Moreover, it is possible that additional wastes will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.” Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes, and any future “hazardous wastes” designations of the solid waste we dispose on behalf of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance these requirements will not change and compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, tighter regulation for the protection of the environment and other factors may make it more difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist.Human CapitalAt December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 3,000 employees, comprised of approximately 700 salaried employees and approximately 2,300 hourly employees. The percentage of our employees represented by unions at December 31, 2023 was approximately 20%. We maintain agreements with various unions representing groups of our employees at project sites, and we typically renew these agreements periodically. We consider our relationships with our employees and the applicable labor unions to be satisfactory.Our business is dependent upon a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Substantially all of our employees are hired on a full-time basis; however, as is typical in the construction industry, we experience a high degree of turnover as construction projects are completed. In the past, we have been able to attract a sufficient number of personnel to support the growth of our operations; however, we continue to face competition for experienced workers in all of our markets, and we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract a sufficient number of personnel.7Our employees are important to the success of our business. Hiring, developing and retaining our employees is not only important, but is a necessity for continued growth and delivery at all levels within our organization. Every employee is critical to our organization’s success, and we are dedicated to ensuring that we manage our workforce’s needs and requirements. We often work in tight labor markets that make hiring and retaining employees challenging. Therefore, it is critical to have a strategic plan for hiring and managing our workforce. We develop hiring practices by geographic area to ensure a customizable recruiting strategy that allows all of our businesses to thrive. Retaining our employees through various means of succession planning and other retention tools is also a critical component of our strategy, particularly for our key positions. Planning for today as well as the future is the cornerstone of our people strategy.Our focus on diversity is at the forefront of how we operate in each of our locations. We strive to instill an inclusive culture that provides all our employees the opportunity to thrive.As of December 31, 2023, our workforce was comprised of the following race and ethnicity demographics:Employees as of December 31, 2023Hispanic47.4%White47.2%Black2.9%Pacific Islander1.4%Other1.1%We focus on our safety processes, which have allowed us to maintain a high level of safety at our work sites. All project employees receive hazard specific training and our newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation and receive follow-up trainings during their first 90 days of employment. Our project managers and superintendents work closely with our safety department to ensure safety is planned into all of our operations before they begin. Additionally, our project foremen are required to conduct daily safety briefings with our employees. Regular safety walkthroughs are conducted by our managers, supervisors and safety staff to evaluate project conditions and observe employee safety behavior. To address the safety and health of our workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional employee health and safety protocols.Access to Company’s FilingsThe Company maintains a website at www.strlco.com on which our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and, any amendments to those reports may be accessed free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC; some directly on the website and others through a link to the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) where those reports are filed. Our website also has recent press releases, the Company’s code of business conduct, the charters of the audit committee, the compensation and talent development committee, and the corporate governance and nominating committee of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) and information on the Company’s “whistleblower” procedures. Our website content is made available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes, and none of the information on the website is intended to be incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below; any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from our past, or from our anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, including additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and cash flows.Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of our future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.8Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryDemand for our services may decrease during economic recessions or volatile economic cycles, and a reduction in demand in end markets may adversely affect our business.Across our three operating segments, the revenue and profit generated are from infrastructure projects and services, but we do not directly control the process by which such infrastructure projects and services are awarded. The construction industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recessions, downturns in business cycles of our customers, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control. Many factors, including the financial condition of the infrastructure industry, could adversely affect our customers and their willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future. Additionally, consolidation, competition or capital constraints in the industries we serve may result in reduced spending by our customers.Economic, regulatory and market conditions affecting our specific end markets may adversely impact the demand for our services, resulting in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects and these conditions may continue to adversely affect us in the future.Our dependence on suppliers of materials and subcontractors could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all.The price and availability of the materials required to execute our projects are subject to volatility and disruptions caused by global economic factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures, rising inflation and potential economic slowdown or recession, as well as fuel and energy costs, the impact of natural disasters, public health crises (such as COVID-19), geopolitical conflicts (such as the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East), and other matters that have impacted or could impact the global economy. If shortages and cost increases in materials and tightness in the labor market persist for a prolonged period of time, and we are unable to offset such cost increases, our profit margins could be adversely impacted.We rely on third party suppliers to provide substantially all of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, oil and fuel) for our contracts and third party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our projects. Increasing prices of materials and equipment and substantial delays in delivering supplies have and could continue to adversely impact our operations and construction projects. For the past several years, our operating margins have been adversely impacted, and may continue to be impacted, by price increases for certain materials, including fuel, concrete, steel and lumber. To the extent that we are unable to obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials or engage subcontractors, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. If we do not accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs related to a project when we bid for a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.The majority of our revenues and backlog are derived from fixed-unit price contracts and lump sum contracts. Fixed-unit price contracts require us to provide materials and services at a fixed-unit price based on agreed quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require the contract work to be completed for a single price irrespective of our actual costs incurred. Our ability to achieve profitability under such contracts is dependent upon our ability to avoid cost overruns by accurately estimating our costs and then successfully controlling our actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, we may incur losses due to cost overruns or the contract may be less profitable than expected. As a result, these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original estimates due to a variety of factors, that may include, but are not limited to the following:•onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;•failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;•delays caused by weather conditions;•contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders or contract price adjustments;•changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment; and9•claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is a part.Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. Public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.Further, in most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to timely complete a project could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract.We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline.We service a significant portion of our contracts with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts, thereby reducing contract profitability. Further, new equipment may not be available, or it may not be purchased or rented in a cost effective manner, which could adversely affect our operating results. The equipment that we own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to maintain or repair equipment ourselves, we may be forced to obtain third party repair services, which could increase our costs. Additionally, we rely on the availability of component parts from suppliers for the maintenance and repair of our equipment. The failure of suppliers to deliver component parts necessary to maintain our equipment could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. We may not accurately assess and/or estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates we need to complete a project, particularly for projects in rural areas.Particularly for projects in rural areas, we may estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for aggregates (such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag and recycled concrete) from sources that we have not previously used as suppliers, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regarding aggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delays and other inefficiencies. If we fail to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates, it could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.Timing of the award and performance of new contracts may fluctuate.It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as our contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial.The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are necessary for then-existing needs, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity.Because all of our construction projects are performed outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to seasonal weather conditions that may delay our work and contribute to project inefficiency. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Extreme heat or cold can prevent us from performing certain types of operations. For example, during the late fall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in the Rocky Mountain States has been curtailed at times due to snow and other work-limiting weather. In addition, our work is subject to extreme and unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, in 2021 there was a Texas-wide freezing weather event that caused delays for some of our Transportation Solutions and Building Solutions operations. Future extreme weather events may limit the availability of resources, increase our costs, delay our performance of work for extended periods of time, or cause our projects to be canceled. While revenues can be recovered following a period of 10bad weather, it is generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed. To the extent climate change results in an increase in such extreme adverse weather conditions, the likelihood of a negative impact on our operations may increase.We rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, which are subject to disruption, failure or security breaches.We rely on information technology (“IT”) systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential information on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.Major public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt the Company’s operations and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.Pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (including any new variants), that interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others to conduct business have and could adversely affect the global economy and our results of operations and financial condition. For example, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, or government actions or other restrictions in connection with any future major public health crisis.Risks Related to Our SegmentsE-Infrastructure SolutionsOur E-Infrastructure Solutions business, as well as the industries of many of our customers upon whom we are dependent, are susceptible to economic downturns, including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth. Demand for our E-Infrastructure Solutions business is cyclical and may be vulnerable to economic downturns, market interest rate fluctuations or other adverse developments in the credit markets, and reductions in private industry spending; the effects of which may cause our customers to delay, curtail or cancel proposed and existing projects. A number of factors can adversely affect the industries we serve, including, among other things, financing or credit availability, potential bankruptcies, global and U.S. trade relationships or other geopolitical events. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing for our customers could cause our customers to reduce their spending for our services or affect the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.Building SolutionsThe homebuilding industry is cyclical and susceptible to downward changes in general economic or other business conditions which could adversely affect our Building Solutions projects, including foundations for single-family and multi-family homes.The Building Solutions industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels. Beginning in 2022, rising inflation and increased interest rates made home ownership less affordable, which resulted in decreased demand for single-family homes. The continuation or worsening of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of Building Solutions concrete projects we have or reduce the prices we can charge for these projects, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.11We cannot predict with certainty whether the decline in the U.S. housing market beginning in 2022 will continue or worsen due to changes in conditions that are beyond our control, which may include the following:•continued increases in interest rates;•continued or worsening inflationary pressures;•economic downturn or recession;•shortage of lots available for development;•changes in demographics and population migration that impair the demand for new housing;•labor shortages, especially craft labor, and rising costs of labor; and•changes in the tax laws that reduce the benefits of home ownership.Transportation SolutionsThe heavy highway construction industry is highly competitive, with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded.In the past, many of the heavy highway contracts on which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other considerations, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer and reputation. Within our geographic markets, we compete with many international, national, regional and local construction firms. Several of these competitors have achieved greater geographic market penetration than we have in the geographic markets in which we compete, and/or have greater resources, including financial resources, than we do. In addition, a number of international and national companies in the heavy highway industry that are larger than we are and that currently do not have a significant presence in our geographic markets, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our geographic markets and compete with us for contracts.In addition, if the use of design-build, construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced.Our Transportation Solutions business relies on highly competitive and highly regulated state or local government contracts.State and local government funding for public works projects is limited, thus creating a highly competitive environment for the limited number of public projects available. In addition, state and local government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of regulatory requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result, any violations of these regulations could bring about litigation and could cause termination of other existing state or local government contracts and result in the loss of future state or local government contracts. Due to the significant competition in the marketplace and the level of regulations on state or local government contracts, we could suffer reductions in new projects and see lower revenues and profit margins on those projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.Our Transportation Solutions business depends on our ability to qualify as an eligible bidder under state or local government contract criteria and to compete successfully against other qualified bidders in order to obtain state or local government contracts.State and local government agencies conduct rigorous competitive processes for awarding many contracts. Some contracts include multiple award task order contracts in which several contractors are selected as eligible bidders for future work. We will potentially face strong competition and pricing pressures for any additional Transportation Solutions contract awards from other government agencies, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under various multiple award task order contract criteria. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under state or local government contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain other government contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain state or local government contracts and to win those Transportation Solutions contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.12The design-build project delivery method subjects our Transportation Solutions business to the risk of design errors and omissions.We could be liable for a design error or omission that causes or contributes to damages with respect to one of our Transportation Solutions design-build projects. Although by contract we pass design responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors and omissions insurance that we individually purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our Transportation Solutions projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Performance problems on existing and future Transportation Solutions contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the infrastructure industry and among our customers.An inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue for our Transportation Solutions business.As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide bonding to our Transportation Solutions customers to secure our performance under our contracts. Our ability to obtain bonding primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the credit market. Bonding companies and banks consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the financial markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit the amount that we can bid on new contracts for our Transportation Solutions business and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.Our Transportation Solutions business is susceptible to economic downturns and reductions in state or local government funding of infrastructure projects.Our business is highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depend on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects. For example, state spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us since we are reliant upon contracts with state transportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues.Refer to our “Business—Segments, Markets and Customers” section within Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of our geographic markets, and refer to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Outlook and Trends” for a discussion of our current expectations regarding federal spending.A prolonged government shutdown may adversely affect our Transportation Solutions business.We derive a significant portion of our Transportation Solutions revenue from governmental agencies and programs. A prolonged government shutdown could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants, approvals, or cause other situations that could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under government contracts, or the delay or cancellation of key government programs in which we are involved, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Construction Joint Venture Partners and CustomersOur participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.As part of our business, we are a party to construction joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these construction joint projects depends in part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations.We and our construction joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our construction joint ventures. If a construction joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for 13our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduce our profit on a project.Certain counterparties to construction joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements following a merger or acquisition. Any termination of a construction joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2023, there was approximately $230.0 million of construction work to be completed on unconsolidated construction joint venture contracts, of which $112.4 million represented our proportionate share. We are not aware of any situation that would require us to fulfill responsibilities of our construction joint venture partners pursuant to the joint and several liability under our contracts.We may not be able to recover on claims or change orders against clients for payment or on claims against subcontractors for performance.We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price. Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract without adding new provisions. They generally include changes in specifications or design, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and periods for completion of work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price (or amounts not included in the original contract price) that we seek to collect for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations or other causes of unanticipated additional costs. These costs may or may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. In addition, we may have claims against subcontractors for performance or non-performance related issues that resulted in additional costs on a project. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly document and negotiate a recovery for change orders and claims could have a negative impact on our cash flows and overall ability to recover change orders and claims, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are dependent on a limited number of significant customers.Due to the size and nature of our contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. We are unable to predict whether a customer will have a significant downturn in their business or financial condition. The loss of business or a default or delay in payment from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Most of our contracts can be canceled on short notice.Our contracts generally have clauses that permit the cancellation of the contract unilaterally and at any time as long as the customer compensates us for the work already completed and for additional contractual costs for cancellation. A cancellation of an unfinished contract could cause our equipment and work crews to be idle for a period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Risks Related to Our WorkforceOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers for each of our subsidiaries. The loss of the services of any of our subsidiaries’ management-level personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. Our business operations may be further impacted by general labor shortages in our industry or markets. If competition for additional employees is intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.14We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.In Arizona, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey and New York, we have project personnel that are unionized. Additional groups of our employees may also unionize in the future. If at any time a significant amount of our employees unionized, it could limit the flexibility of the workforce and could result in demands that might increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with unions could result in work stoppages, and any new or extended contracts could result in increased operating costs. Each of our different employee groups could unionize at any time and would require separate collective bargaining agreements. If any group of our employees were to unionize and we were unable to agree on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or we were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by organized labor groups protesting our non-union status. The future or continued occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.If we are unable to comply with applicable immigration laws, our ability to successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted.We rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all undocumented immigrants who work for us. Our failure to identify undocumented immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance as well as negative reputational impacts relating to health and safety matters.Our workers are subject to hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. These operating hazards can cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment, or environmental damage. On most sites, we are responsible for safety and are contractually obligated to implement safety procedures. Our safety record is an important consideration for us and for our customers. If we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, our safety record could substantially deteriorate, which may preclude us from bidding on certain work, expose us to potential lawsuits or cause customers to cancel existing contracts.We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and infrastructure industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We contribute to multiemployer plans that could result in liabilities to us if those plans are terminated or if we withdraw from those plans.We contribute to several multiemployer pension plans for employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multiemployer plan in the event of the employer’s withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. If we terminate, withdraw, or partially withdraw from other multiemployer pension plans, we could be required to make significant cash contributions to fund that plans unfunded vested benefit, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; however, we are not currently able to determine the net assets and actuarial present value of the multiemployer pension plans’ unfunded vested benefits allocable to us, if any, and we are not presently aware of the amounts, if any, for which we may be contingently liable if we were to withdraw from any of these plans. In addition, if the funding level of any of these multiemployer plans becomes classified as “critical status” under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we could be required to make significant additional contributions to those plans.15Risks Related to Regulatory MattersEnvironmental and other regulatory matters, including those relating to climate change, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, growing concerns about climate change and other environmental issues could result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Generally, environmental laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could increase our compliance costs. Compliance with new regulations could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities.Our aggregate quarry leases in Utah and Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarries, we could be held responsible for any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarries. Any such costs and liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our construction projects involving concrete.In the recent past, the federal government imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods used in connection with our construction business, including steel and lumber, which raised our costs for these items (or products made with them). Foreign governments, including China and Canada, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. Any trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our costs further, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business and result of operations.Tax matters, including changes in corporate tax laws and disagreements with taxing authorities, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.We conduct business across the United States and file income taxes in the federal and various state jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in our accounting for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and regulations, in addition to changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance, could materially impact our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Issues relating to tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties and uncertainty in obtaining deductions or credits claimed in various jurisdictions could also impact the accounting for income taxes. Our results of operations are reported based on our determination of the amount of taxes we owe in various tax jurisdictions, and our provision for income taxes and tax liabilities are subject to review or examination by taxing authorities in applicable tax jurisdictions. An adverse outcome of such a review or examination could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further, the results of tax examinations and audits could have a negative impact on our financial results and cash flows where the results differ from the liabilities recorded in our financial statements.16Risks Related to Strategy and AcquisitionsOur strategy, which includes expanding into adjacent markets, may not be successful.We may continue to pursue growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into new markets. We have completed several acquisitions and plan to consider strategic acquisitions in the future. We may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable companies or assets or reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms. Moreover, an acquisition involves certain risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of operations, systems, policies and procedures;•enhancements in controls and procedures including those necessary for a public company may make it more difficult to integrate operations and systems;•failure to implement proper overall business controls, including those required to support our growth, resulting in inconsistent operating and financial practices at companies we acquire or have acquired;•termination of relationships with the key personnel and customers of an acquired company;•additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;•the incurrence of environmental and other liabilities, including liabilities arising from the operation of an acquired business or asset prior to our acquisition for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;•insufficient management attention to our ongoing business; and•inability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that we anticipate.Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Financing and LiquidityOur use of over time revenue recognition (formerly known as percentage-of-completion method) accounting related to our projects could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported revenue and profits.As is more fully discussed in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Critical Accounting Estimates,” we recognize contract revenue over time. This method is used because management considers the cost-to-cost measure of progress to be the best measure of progress on these contracts.Under this method, estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the cost-to-cost measure of progress for the period (based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and the performance of subcontractors. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These adjustments could result in both increases and decreases in profit margins or losses. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our business. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our Backlog.Backlog as of December 31, 2023 totaled $2.07 billion. Backlog develops as a result of new awards, which represent the potential revenue value realizable pursuant to new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog is measured and defined differently by companies within our industry. We refer to “Backlog” as the unearned revenue we expect to earn in future periods on our executed contracts. As the construction on our projects progresses, we increase or decrease Backlog to take into account newly signed contracts, revenue earned during the period and our estimates of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changed conditions, change orders and other variations from previously anticipated contract revenues, including completion penalties and incentives. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our Backlog will be realized, or if realized, will result in earnings.Given these factors, our Backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our Backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year. Inability to realize revenue from our Backlog could have an adverse effect on our business.17We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as the condition of our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us and makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions.We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral in connection with that certain credit agreement, dated as of October 2, 2019, by and among the Company, as borrower, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, the financial institutions party thereto as lenders and BMO Bank N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), and we have additionally pledged the proceeds of and other rights under our E-Infrastructure Solutions and Transportation Solutions contracts to our bonding agent. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, under our Credit Agreement, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur additional debt from other sources (subject to certain limited exceptions).If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.We incurred indebtedness in connection with recent acquisitions, and the agreement governing such indebtedness contains various covenants and other provisions that impose restrictions on our ability to operate and manage our business.As of December 31, 2023, our aggregate principal amount outstanding under our credit facility (“Credit Facility”) was $343.4 million. The Credit Facility will mature on April 2, 2026. While we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet or refinance our obligations when they come due, we cannot fully anticipate our future performance or financial condition, the future condition of the credit markets or the economy generally.The Credit Agreement governing the indebtedness incurred by us under our Credit Facility contains certain subsidiary guarantees, which are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all assets directly owned by such subsidiaries and us, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire capital stock or other equity interests, or merge or consolidate with any other person, among various other things.In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios and to prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement in certain cases with proceeds from the issuance of additional debt, asset dispositions, events of loss and excess cash flows. These requirements could limit our cash flow or impair our ability to conduct business and pursue business strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our and their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our debt repayment obligations, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt or bonding agreements. The Credit Agreement also contains a cross-default provision. This provision could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default of a single debt instrument. Our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our debt instruments that could be accelerated upon such an event of default.Further, our level of indebtedness could have important other consequences to our business, including the following:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and infrastructure industry conditions;•limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt service;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;•limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt; or•requiring that we pledge substantial collateral, which may limit flexibility in operating our business and restrict our ability to sell assets.18We may elect to borrow, continue or convert certain term or revolving loans under our Credit Agreement to bear interest at either a base rate plus a margin, or at a one-, three-, or six-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) plus a margin, at the Company’s election. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.To service our indebtedness and to fund working capital, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that are beyond our control, including the fact that adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital. Our ability to generate cash, outside of funds available through our revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”), is subject to our operational performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may be unable to expand our credit capacity, which could adversely affect our operations and business. Earnings from our operations and our working capital requirements can vary from period to period, based primarily on the mix of our projects underway and the percentage of project work completed during the period. Capital expenditures may also vary significantly from period to period. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or asset sales or that we can obtain future borrowing capacity in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, to fund working capital requirements or to fund our other liquidity needs. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer.In the event we cannot generate enough cash to satisfy our liquidity needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, restricts our ability to incur additional financing indebtedness. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. The domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets may experience significant volatility, disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability. Should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain such additional funds. If internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms also could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we experience operational difficulties, we may need to increase our available borrowing capacity or seek amendments to the terms of our Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any additional capacity or amendment to our Credit Agreement or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, in which case, our costs of borrowing could rise and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We must manage our liquidity carefully to fund our working capital.The need for working capital for our business varies due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors:•receivables;•contract retentions;•contract assets;•contract liabilities;•the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and•the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors.We may have limited cash on hand and the timing of payments on our contract receivables is difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed or the amount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materially and adversely affected.We may be required to write down all or part of our goodwill and intangibles.We had approximately $281 million of goodwill and $328 million of intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is separable; that is, it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged (whether there is intent to do so). A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly 19below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill or intangible assets have been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill and periodic assessments of intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired. On an interim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing. Write downs of goodwill and intangible assets may be substantial. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets in future periods, our net earnings and equity could be materially adversely affected.Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and internal controls could lead to errors in reporting our financial results.The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, resource challenges and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, otherwise fail to prevent financial reporting misstatements, or if we experience difficulties in implementing internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Please refer to Item 9A of this annual report on Form 10-K for further information.Risks Related to Our Common StockWe cannot guarantee that our Stock Repurchase Program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $200 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock over a 24-month period (the “Stock Repurchase Program”). The timing and amount of any share repurchases is at the discretion of the Company’s management, subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and related rules. As a result, there can be no guarantee around the timing or volume of our share repurchases. We intend to finance any stock repurchases with cash on hand and through operating cash flow. There is no guarantee as to the number of shares that will be repurchased, and the Stock Repurchase Program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time without notice at our discretion, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. The Stock Repurchase Program could increase volatility in and affect the price of our common stock. The existence of our Stock Repurchase Program could also cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Additionally, repurchases under our Stock Repurchase Program will diminish our cash reserves. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price. Although our Stock Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness.Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and in Delaware law may discourage a takeover attempt.Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, one or more series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights (including preferences over the common stock respecting dividends and distributions and voting rights) as the Board of Directors may determine. The issuance of this “blank-check” preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. Additionally, certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law or even certain provisions of our credit agreement may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the Board of Directors.The price of our common stock has experienced volatility.The price of our common stock has experienced volatility. Our stock price may continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in “Risks Factors,” variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors, downward revisions in securities analysts’ estimates, and announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments"

BusinessOverview of the Company’s BusinessSterling Infrastructure, Inc. (“Sterling” or “the Company”) operates through a variety of subsidiaries within three segments specializing in E-Infrastructure, Transportation and Building Solutions in the United States (the “U.S.”), primarily across the Southern, Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S., the Rocky Mountain States, and Hawaii, as well as other areas with strategic construction opportunities. E-Infrastructure Solutions projects include advanced, large-scale site development systems and services for data centers, e-commerce distribution centers, warehousing, transportation, energy and more. Transportation Solutions includes infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airports, ports, light rail and storm drainage systems. Building Solutions projects include residential and commercial concrete foundations for single-family and multi-family homes, parking structures, elevated slabs and other concrete work. From strategy to operations, we are committed to sustainability by operating responsibly to safeguard and improve society’s quality of life. Caring for our people and our communities, our customers and our investors – that is The Sterling Way.In this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, “Sterling,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” means Sterling and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, references to “Note” or “Notes” refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K, unless indicated otherwise.Business StrategySince 2016, our strategic vision has been based on the following elements and objectives:Strategic ElementsStrategic ObjectivesSolidifying the baseRisk ReductionGrowing high margin products and servicesBottom-Line GrowthExpansion into adjacent marketsExceed Peer PerformanceBuild a Platform for Future Accretive GrowthSolidifying the base—The Company’s historic base business is our low-bid heavy highway projects within our Transportation Solutions segment. Heavy highway projects typically have gross margins of 7-8%; however, prior to 2016 our gross margin was approximately 4%. In 2016 we implemented a strategy to solidify this base business by improving bid discipline to significantly reduce the probability of project losses. To execute this strategic focus, a key objective, risk reduction, was prioritized. Since the implementation of the strategy and application of the key objective, we have improved the heavy highway backlog gross margin to 10.9% as of December 31, 2022, and we expect gross margins to continue improving as we continue to execute our strategy.Growing high margin products and services—While solidifying the base is important to the profitability of the Company, the improvement of gross margins is limited due to the highly competitive bidding environment for heavy highway projects. In 2016 we implemented a strategy to shift our project mix from low-bid heavy highway projects to alternative delivery heavy highway projects and other higher margin work (e.g., airports, commercial, piling and shoring). In 2016 our low-bid heavy highway revenue was approximately 79% of our total revenue, but we have progressively brought that down to 11% as of December 31, 2022. The key objective in this strategic area is our focus on bottom-line growth, and the higher margin projects we target have gross margins in the range of 12%-15%.Expansion into adjacent markets—In 2016, we implemented a strategy to pursue growth through the acquisition of companies and assets that will enable us to expand into adjacent markets and broaden the types of projects we execute. We operate a decentralized, adaptive business model, which provides us with flexibility to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Our acquisition strategy has focused on businesses that can strengthen our current portfolio, enable us to expand into complementary categories or geographic regions or provide diversification of cash flows. The companies we target for acquisition typically have gross margins of 15% or more. This strategic focus allows us to broaden our portfolio of products and services, and broaden our end customer base to remain competitive in the markets where we operate. Since 2016, we have completed five acquisitions and plan to consider other strategic acquisitions in the future.Recent Strategic TransactionsKimes Acquisition—On December 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Kimes & Stone (“Kimes”) for an all-cash purchase price of approximately $7.6 million. Kimes provides a diversified services offering of soil stabilization for site development on e-commerce projects such as large fulfillment and distribution centers and data centers, as well as soil stabilization for roadways and manufacturing plant construction. The transaction included a fleet of soil stabilization equipment 4and working capital. The results of Kimes are included within Plateau, which is included within our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment. See Note 3 - Acquisitions for further discussion.Petillo Acquisition—On December 30, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Petillo Incorporated and its related entities (collectively, “Petillo”) for aggregate consideration of $196.8 million, consisting of $175.0 million in cash, 759,447 shares of the Company’s common stock, and a target working capital adjustment of $1.4 million. Petillo is a leading specialty site development contractor based in Flanders, New Jersey, and serves the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic States, providing large-scale site infrastructure improvement service, including full-service excavation, underground utility construction, environmental remediation, drainage systems for commercial construction and water management and distribution systems. The results of Petillo are included within our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment. See Note 3 - Acquisitions for further discussion.Myers Disposition—On November 30, 2022, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) and sold the Company’s 50% ownership interest in its partnership with Myers & Sons Construction L.P. for $18 million in cash. In accordance with the Agreement’s payment terms, the Company is to receive $12 million in January of 2023 and a series of three $2 million payments due by various dates in 2023, 2025, and 2027. The disposition is consistent with the Company’s strategic shift to reduce its portfolio of low-bid heavy highway and water containment & treatment projects in order to reduce risk and improve the Company’s margins and to focus on its strategic geographies outside of California. The disposition represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and consolidated financial results, and accordingly, the historical results of Myers have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to being disclosed as a discontinued operation, the results of Myers were included within our Transportation Solutions segment. See Note 4 - Dispositions for further discussion.CCS Acquisition—On December 20, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Concrete Construction Services of Arizona LLC and its affiliated company’s business (collectively “CCS”) for a purchase price of approximately $21 million. The business of CCS provides residential single-family home concrete foundations, including the preparation, pouring and finishing of post-tension concrete foundations in new housing subdivisions in the greater Phoenix area. The transaction includes working capital, intangible assets, and goodwill. The results of CCS are included within Tealstone which is included within our Building Solutions segment. See Note 3 - Acquisitions for further discussion.Segments, Markets and CustomersThe Company’s internal and public segment reporting are aligned based upon the services offered by its operating groups, which represent the reportable segments. The Company’s operations consist of three reportable segments: E-Infrastructure Solutions, Transportation Solutions and Building Solutions. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 22 - Segment Information for further discussion of our business segments.E-Infrastructure Solutions—Our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment serves large, blue-chip end users in the e-commerce, data center, distribution center, warehousing, energy sectors and more. We are a leading provider of large-scale specialty site infrastructure improvement contracting services in the Southeastern, Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. In our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment, four customers accounted for 35% of that segment’s revenue in 2022, 58% in 2021 and 44% in 2020.    Transportation Solutions—Our Transportation Solutions segment is comprised of heavy highway, aviation and rail, and relies heavily on federal and state infrastructure spending. The principal markets of this segment are Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Texas and Utah. Within these principal markets, our core customers are the Departments of Transportation (“DOT(s)”) in various states, regional transit authorities, airport authorities, port authorities, water authorities and railroads. In our Transportation Solutions segment, four state DOTs accounted for 44% of that segment’s revenue in 2022, 42% in 2021 and 44% in 2020.Building Solutions—Our Building Solutions segment is comprised of our residential and commercial businesses. The principal market for our residential business is Texas, specifically the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas and the surrounding communities. In 2021, we began expanding our footprint into the greater Phoenix area and continued in 2022 with the acquisition of the CCS business. Our core residential customer base is comprised of leading national home builders as well as regional and custom home builders. Our commercial business focuses on concrete construction of multi-family foundations, parking structures, elevated slabs and other concrete work for leading developers and general contractors in commercial markets. In our Building Solutions segment, four customers, including their respective affiliates, accounted for 60% of that segment’s revenue in 2022, 57% in 2021 and 50% in 2020.5In 2022, no individual customer contributed more than 10% of our consolidated revenues; however we routinely construct projects for our largest customers mentioned above. The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Note 20 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures for the Company’s major customers that represent a concentration of risk due to their significant revenue contributions.CompetitionCompetition for our segments ranges from small local contractors to large international construction companies. We traditionally try to position ourselves to bid on work too large for the small local contractors yet too small for the large national and international construction companies. However, if market conditions became less favorable, we would tend to see migration from both the small local contractors and large international players into that mid-level market. This, in return, could increase competitive bidding pressure and reduce both revenue growth and margins. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” for further discussion of risks associated with our competitive environment.SeasonalityOperations for our segments are typically affected by weather conditions primarily during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which may alter construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues, profitability and the required number of employees. For additional discussion regarding the potential impacts of seasonality on our business, see Item 1A “Risk Factors
.”ResourcesWe purchase raw materials for our segments, including but not limited to, cement, aggregate, concrete, liquid asphalt, lumber, steel, diesel and gasoline fuel, natural gas and propane from numerous sources. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to fluctuations in market conditions and production capacities.Backlog    Our remaining performance obligations on our projects, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, do not differ from what we refer to as “Backlog.” Our Backlog represents the amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from our contract commitments on projects. The value of our Backlog was $1.41 billion at December 31, 2022, as compared to $1.33 billion at December 31, 2021. We exclude from Backlog contracts where we are the apparent low bidder for projects (“Unsigned Low-bid Awards”) until the contract is executed by our customer (approximately $275.0 million at December 31, 2022). Certain Building Solutions revenue is recognized upon completion at a point in time and therefore is never reflected in our Backlog. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Outlook and Trends” for discussion and quantification of our Backlog. Also see Item 1A “Risk Factors
” for further discussion of risks related to Backlog.ContractsOur contracts are awarded on a competitively bid basis or negotiated bid basis using a range of contracting options, including fixed-unit price, lump sum and cost-reimbursable. Each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages. Typically, the Company assumes more risk with lump-sum contracts; however, these types of contracts offer additional profits if the work is completed for less than originally estimated. Under fixed-unit price contracts, the Company’s profit may vary if actual labor-hour costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates. Each contract is designed to optimize the balance between risk and reward. At December 31, 2022, substantially all of our backlog was contracted on a fixed-unit price or lump sum basis. We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price. Also, because some contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs, the components of contract cost can impact profitability.Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain termination for convenience clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but would require that the Company be compensated for work performed through the date of termination and additional contractual costs for cancellation. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our types of risk and how we mitigate cancellation and credit risk.6Insurance and BondingOur buildings and equipment are covered by insurance, at levels our management believes to be adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability, excess liability, workers’ compensation and auto insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice.As a normal part of the Transportation Solutions business and occasionally with the E-Infrastructure Solutions business, we are required to provide various types of surety and payment bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under the contract. Typically, a bidder for a contract must post a bid bond, generally for 5% to 10% of the bid amount, and on being awarded the bid, must post a performance and payment bond for up to 100% of the costs to construct. Usually, upon posting of the performance bond, a contractor must also post a maintenance bond for generally 1% of the contract amount for one to two years. Our ability to obtain bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, aggregate contract size, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Bonding companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. As is customary, we have agreed to indemnify our bonding company for all losses incurred by it in connection with bonds that are issued, and we have granted our bonding company a security interest in certain assets, including accounts receivable, as collateral for such obligation.Government and Environmental RegulationsOur operations are subject to compliance with numerous regulatory requirements of federal, state and local agencies and authorities, including regulations concerning safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues, immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of our business. For example, our operations are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws directed toward the protection of employees. In addition, most of our Transportation Solutions construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional governmental requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses.All of our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges into air, water and land, climate change, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. For example, we must apply water or chemicals to reduce dust on road construction projects and to contain contaminants in storm run-off water at construction sites. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous wastes encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the customer. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, impose strict and retroactive joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances.CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur.Solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes, are subject to the requirements of the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, referred to as RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Although we do not generate solid waste, we occasionally dispose of solid waste on behalf of customers. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Moreover, it is possible that additional wastes will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.” Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes.We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance these requirements will not change and compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, tighter regulation for the protection of the environment and other factors may make it more difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist.7Human CapitalAt December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 3,200 employees, comprised of approximately 600 salaried employees and approximately 2,600 hourly employees. The percentage of our employees represented by unions at December 31, 2022 was approximately 29%. We have agreements, which we customarily renew periodically, with various unions representing groups of employees at project sites. We consider our relationships with our employees and the applicable labor unions to be satisfactory.Our business is dependent upon a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Substantially all of our employees are hired on a full-time basis; however, as is typical in the construction industry, we experience a high degree of turnover as construction projects are completed. In the past, we have been able to attract a sufficient number of personnel to support the growth of our operations; however, we continue to face competition for experienced workers in all our markets.Our employees are important to the success of our business. Hiring, developing and retaining our employees is not only important, but is a necessity for continued growth and delivery at all levels within our organization. Every employee is critical to the success of our organization and we strive daily to ensure that we are managing our workforce’s needs and requirements. We often work in tight labor markets that make hiring and retaining employees challenging. Therefore, it is critical to have a strategic plan for hiring and managing our workforce. We develop hiring practices by geographic area to ensure a customizable recruiting strategy that allows all of our businesses to thrive. Retaining our employees through various means of succession planning and other retention tools is also a critical component of our strategy, particularly for our key positions. Planning for today as well as the future is the cornerstone of our people strategy.Our focus on diversity is at the forefront of how we operate in each of our locations. We strive to instill an inclusive culture that allows all employees the opportunity to thrive. As of December 31, 2022, our workforce was comprised of the following race and ethnicity demographics:Employees as of December 31, 2022Hispanic51.8%White41.7%Black3.5%Pacific Islander1.6%Other1.4%We focus on our safety processes which have allowed us to maintain a high level of safety at our work sites. All project employees receive hazard specific training and our newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation and receive follow-up trainings during their first 90 days of employment. Our project managers and superintendents work closely with the safety department to ensure safety is planned into all of our operations before they begin. Daily, our project foremen are required to conduct safety briefings with employees. Regular safety walkthroughs are conducted by our managers, supervisors and safety staff to evaluate project conditions and observe employee safety behavior. To address the safety and health of our workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional employee health and safety protocols.Access to Company’s FilingsThe Company maintains a website at www.strlco.com on which our latest annual report on Form 10-K, recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, recent current reports on Form 8-K, any amendments to those filings and other filings may be accessed free of charge; some directly on the website and others through a link to the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) where those reports are filed.

The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the 8Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below; any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and cash flows. These could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below.Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of our future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryDemand for our services may decrease during economic recessions or volatile economic cycles, and a reduction in demand in end markets may adversely affect our business.Across our three operating segments, the revenue and profit generated is from construction projects and services, the awarding of which we do not directly control. The construction industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recessions, downturns in business cycles of our customers, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control. Many factors, including the financial condition of the industry, could adversely affect our customers and their willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future. Additionally, consolidation, competition or capital constraints in the industries we serve may result in reduced spending by our customers.Economic, regulatory and market conditions affecting our specific end markets may adversely impact the demand for our services, resulting in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects and these conditions may continue to adversely affect us in the future. For example, during fiscal 2022, our Building Solutions segment began to see a moderation in housing demand due to increases in mortgage interest rates reducing the affordability of homes.Our dependence on suppliers of materials and subcontractors could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all.The price and availability of the materials required to execute our projects are subject to volatility and disruptions caused by global economic factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures, rising inflation and potential economic slowdown or recession, as well as fuel and energy costs, the impact of natural disasters, public health crises (such as COVID-19), geopolitical conflicts (such as the conflict in Ukraine), and other matters that have impacted or could impact the global economy. If shortages and cost increases in materials and tightness in the labor market persist for a prolonged period of time, our profit margins could be adversely impacted if we are unable to offset cost increases.We rely on third party suppliers to provide substantially all of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, oil and fuel) for our contracts and third party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our projects. Increasing prices of materials and equipment, including due to inflation, and substantial delays in delivering supplies have and could continue to adversely impact our operations and construction projects. In 2022, our operating margins were adversely impacted, and may continue to be impacted, by price increases for certain materials, including fuel, concrete, steel and lumber. To the extent that we are unable to obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials or engage subcontractors, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. If we do not accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs related to a project when we bid for a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.The majority of our revenues and backlog are derived from fixed-unit price contracts and lump sum contracts. Fixed-unit price contracts require us to provide materials and services at a fixed-unit price based on agreed quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require the contract work to be completed for a single price irrespective of our actual costs incurred. Our ability to achieve profitability under such contracts is dependent upon our ability to avoid cost overruns by accurately estimating our costs and then successfully controlling our actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, we may incur losses due to cost overruns or the 9contract may be less profitable than expected. As a result, these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original estimates due to a variety of factors, that may include, but not limited to the following:•onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;•failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;•delays caused by weather conditions;•contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders or contract price adjustments;•changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment; and•claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is a part.Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. Public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.Further, in most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to timely complete a project could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract.We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline.We service a significant portion of our contracts with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts, thereby reducing contract profitability. Further, new equipment may not be available, or it may not be purchased or rented in a cost effective manner, which could adversely affect our operating results. The equipment that we own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to maintain or repair equipment ourselves, we may be forced to obtain third party repair services, which could increase our costs. Additionally, we rely on the availability of component parts from suppliers for the maintenance and repair of our equipment. The failure of suppliers to deliver component parts necessary to maintain our equipment could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. We may not accurately assess and/or estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates we need to complete a project, particularly for projects in rural areas.Particularly for projects in rural areas, we may estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for aggregates (such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag and recycled concrete) from sources that we have not previously used as suppliers, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regarding aggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delays and other inefficiencies. If we fail to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates, it could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.Timing of the award and performance of new contracts may fluctuate.It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as our contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial.The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are necessary for then-existing needs, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future 10contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity.Because all of our construction projects are performed outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to seasonal weather conditions that may delay our work and contribute to project inefficiency. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Extreme heat or cold can prevent us from performing certain types of operations. For example, during the late fall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in the Rocky Mountain States has been curtailed at times due to snow and other work-limiting weather. In addition, our work is subject to extreme and unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey caused damage and disruption that resulted in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days and in some cases several weeks, and the 2021 Texas-wide freezing weather event also caused delays for some of our Transportation Solutions and Building Solutions operations. Future extreme weather events may limit the availability of resources, increase our costs, delay our performance of work for extended periods of time, or cause our projects to be canceled. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed. To the extent climate change results in an increase in such extreme adverse weather conditions, the likelihood of a negative impact on our operations may increase.We rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, which are subject to disruption, failure or security breaches.We rely on information technology (“IT”) systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential information on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.Major public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt the Company’s operations and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.Pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (including any new variants), that interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others to conduct business have and could adversely affect the global economy and our results of operations and financial condition. For example, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, or government actions or other restrictions in connection with any future major public health crisis.Risks Related to Our SegmentsE-Infrastructure SolutionsOur E-Infrastructure Solutions business, as well as the industries of many of our customers upon whom we are dependent, are susceptible to economic downturns, including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth. Demand for our E-Infrastructure Solutions business is cyclical and may be vulnerable to economic downturns, interest rate fluctuations or other adverse developments in the credit markets, and reductions in private industry spending; the effects of which may cause our customers to delay, curtail or cancel proposed and existing projects. A number of factors can adversely affect the industries we serve, including, among other things, financing or credit availability, potential bankruptcies, global and U.S. trade relationships or other geopolitical events. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing for our customers could cause our customers to reduce their spending for our services or affect the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.11Building SolutionsThe homebuilding industry is cyclical and susceptible to downward changes in general economic or other business conditions which could adversely affect our Building Solutions projects, including foundations for single-family and multi-family homes.The Building Solutions industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels. In 2022, rising inflation and increased interest rates made home ownership less affordable, which resulted in decreased demand for single-family homes. The continuation or worsening of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of Building Solutions concrete projects we have or reduce the prices we can charge for these projects, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We cannot predict with certainty whether the decline in the U.S. housing market beginning in 2022 will continue or worsen due to changes in conditions that are beyond our control, which may include the following:•continued increases in interest rates;•continued or worsening inflationary pressures;•economic downturn or recession;•shortage of lots available for development;•changes in demographics and population migration that impair the demand for new housing;•labor shortages, especially craft labor, and rising costs of labor; and•changes in the tax laws that reduce the benefits of home ownership.Transportation SolutionsThe heavy highway construction industry is highly competitive, with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded.In the past, many of the heavy highway contracts on which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other considerations, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer and reputation. Within our geographic markets, we compete with many international, national, regional and local construction firms. Several of these competitors have achieved greater geographic market penetration than we have in the geographic markets in which we compete, and/or have greater resources, including financial resources, than we do. In addition, a number of international and national companies in the heavy highway industry that are larger than we are and that currently do not have a significant presence in our geographic markets, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our geographic markets and compete with us for contracts.In addition, if the use of design-build, construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced.Our Transportation Solutions business relies on highly competitive and highly regulated state or local government contracts.State and local government funding for public works projects is limited, thus creating a highly competitive environment for the limited number of public projects available. In addition, state and local government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of regulatory requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result, any violations of these regulations could bring about litigation and could cause termination of other existing state or local government contracts and result in the loss of future state or local government contracts. Due to the significant competition in the marketplace and the level of regulations on state or local government contracts, we could suffer reductions in new projects and see lower revenues and profit margins on those projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.12Our Transportation Solutions business depends on our ability to qualify as an eligible bidder under state or local government contract criteria and to compete successfully against other qualified bidders in order to obtain state or local government contracts.State and local government agencies conduct rigorous competitive processes for awarding many contracts. Some contracts include multiple award task order contracts in which several contractors are selected as eligible bidders for future work. We will potentially face strong competition and pricing pressures for any additional Transportation Solutions contract awards from other government agencies, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under various multiple award task order contract criteria. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under state or local government contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain other government contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain state or local government contracts and to win those Transportation Solutions contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.The design-build project delivery method subjects our Transportation Solutions business to the risk of design errors and omissions.We could be liable for a design error or omission that causes or contributes to damages with respect to one of our Transportation Solutions design-build projects. Although by contract we pass design responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors and omissions insurance that we individually purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our Transportation Solutions projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Performance problems on existing and future Transportation Solutions contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers.An inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue for our Transportation Solutions business.As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide bonding to our Transportation Solutions customers to secure our performance under our contracts. Our ability to obtain bonding primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the credit market. Bonding companies and banks consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the financial markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit the amount that we can bid on new contracts for our Transportation Solutions business and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.Our Transportation Solutions business is susceptible to economic downturns and reductions in state or local government funding of infrastructure projects.Our business is highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depend on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects. For example, state spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us since we are reliant upon contracts with state transportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues.Refer to our “Business—Segments, Markets and Customers” section within Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of our geographic markets, and refer to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Outlook and Trends” for a discussion of our current expectations regarding federal spending.A prolonged government shutdown may adversely affect our Transportation Solutions business.We derive a significant portion of our Transportation Solutions revenue from governmental agencies and programs. A prolonged government shutdown could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants, approvals, or cause other situations that could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under government contracts, or the delay or cancellation of key government programs in which we are involved, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.13Risks Related to Our Construction Joint Venture Partners and CustomersOur participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.As part of our business, we are a party to construction joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these construction joint projects depends in part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations.We and our construction joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our construction joint ventures. If a construction joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduce our profit on a project.Certain counterparties to construction joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements following a merger or acquisition. Any termination of a construction joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2022, there was approximately $46.1 million of construction work to be completed on unconsolidated construction joint venture contracts, of which $18.5 million represented our proportionate share. We are not aware of any situation that would require us to fulfill responsibilities of our construction joint venture partners pursuant to the joint and several liability under our contracts.We may not be able to recover on claims or change orders against clients for payment or on claims against subcontractors for performance.We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price. Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract without adding new provisions. They generally include changes in specifications or design, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and periods for completion of work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price (or amounts not included in the original contract price) that we seek to collect for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations or other causes of unanticipated additional costs. These costs may or may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. In addition, we may have claims against subcontractors for performance or non-performance related issues that resulted in additional costs on a project. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly document and negotiate a recovery for change orders and claims could have a negative impact on our cash flows and overall ability to recover change orders and claims, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are dependent on a limited number of significant customers.Due to the size and nature of our contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. We are unable to predict whether a customer will have a significant downturn in their business or financial condition. The loss of business or a default or delay in payment from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Most of our contracts can be canceled on short notice.Our contracts generally have clauses that permit the cancellation of the contract unilaterally and at any time as long as the customer compensates the Company for the work already completed and for additional contractual costs for cancellation. A cancellation of an unfinished contract could cause our equipment and work crews to be idle for a period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.14Risks Related to Our WorkforceOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers for each of our subsidiaries. The loss of the services of any of our subsidiaries’ management-level personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. Our business operations may be further impacted by general labor shortages in our industry or markets. If competition for additional employees is intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.In Arizona, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey and New York, we have project personnel that are unionized. Additional groups of our employees may also unionize in the future. If at any time a significant amount of our employees unionized, it could limit the flexibility of the workforce and could result in demands that might increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with unions could result in work stoppages, and any new or extended contracts could result in increased operating costs. Each of our different employee groups could unionize at any time and would require separate collective bargaining agreements. If any group of our employees were to unionize and we were unable to agree on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or we were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by organized labor groups protesting our non-union status. The future or continued occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.If we are unable to comply with applicable immigration laws, our ability to successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted.We rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all undocumented immigrants who work for us. Our failure to identify undocumented immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance as well as negative reputational impacts relating to health and safety matters.Our workers are subject to hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. These operating hazards can cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment, or environmental damage. On most sites, we are responsible for safety and are contractually obligated to implement safety procedures. Our safety record is an important consideration for us and for our customers. If we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, our safety record could substantially deteriorate, which may preclude us from bidding on certain work, expose us to potential lawsuits or cause customers to cancel existing contracts.We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.15Risks Related to Regulatory MattersEnvironmental and other regulatory matters, including those relating to climate change, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, growing concerns about climate change and other environmental issues could result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Generally, environmental laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could increase our compliance costs. Compliance with new regulations could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities.Our aggregate quarry leases in Utah and Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarries, we could be held responsible for any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarries. Any such costs and liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our construction projects involving concrete.In the recent past, the federal government imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods used in connection with our construction business, including steel and lumber, which raised our costs for these items (or products made with them). Foreign governments, including China and Canada, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. Any trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our costs further, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business and result of operations.Risks Related to Strategy and AcquisitionsOur strategy, which includes expanding into adjacent markets, may not be successful.We may continue to pursue growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into new markets. We have completed several acquisitions and plan to consider strategic acquisitions in the future. We may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable companies or assets or reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms. Moreover, an acquisition involves certain risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of operations, systems, policies and procedures;•enhancements in controls and procedures including those necessary for a public company may make it more difficult to integrate operations and systems;•failure to implement proper overall business controls, including those required to support our growth, resulting in inconsistent operating and financial practices at companies we acquire or have acquired;•termination of relationships with the key personnel and customers of an acquired company;•additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;16•the incurrence of environmental and other liabilities, including liabilities arising from the operation of an acquired business or asset prior to our acquisition for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;•insufficient management attention to our ongoing business; and•inability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that we anticipate.Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Financing and LiquidityOur use of over time revenue recognition (formally known as percentage-of-completion method) accounting related to our projects could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported revenue and profits.As is more fully discussed in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Critical Accounting Estimates,” we recognize contract revenue over time. This method is used because management considers the cost-to-cost measure of progress to be the best measure of progress on these contracts.Under this method, estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the cost-to-cost measure of progress for the period (based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and the performance of subcontractors. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These adjustments could result in both increases and decreases in profit margins or losses. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our business. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our Backlog.Backlog as of December 31, 2022 totaled $1.41 billion. Backlog develops as a result of new awards, which represent the potential revenue value realizable pursuant to new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog is measured and defined differently by companies within our industry. We refer to “Backlog” as the unearned revenue we expect to earn in future periods on our executed contracts. As the construction on our projects progresses, we increase or decrease Backlog to take into account newly signed contracts, revenue earned during the period and our estimates of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changed conditions, change orders and other variations from previously anticipated contract revenues, including completion penalties and incentives. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our Backlog will be realized, or if realized, will result in earnings.Given these factors, our Backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our Backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year. Inability to realize revenue from our Backlog could have an adverse effect on our business.We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as the condition of our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us and makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions.We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral in connection with our Credit Agreement and we have additionally pledged the proceeds of and other rights under our E-Infrastructure Solutions and Transportation Solutions contracts to our bonding agent. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, under our Credit Agreement, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur additional debt from other sources (subject to certain limited exceptions).If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.17We incurred indebtedness in connection with recent acquisitions, and the agreement governing such indebtedness contains various covenants and other provisions that impose restrictions on our ability to operate and manage our business.As of December 31, 2022, our aggregate principal amount outstanding under our credit facility (“Credit Facility”) was $423.7 million. The Credit Facility will mature on October 2, 2024. While we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet or refinance our obligations when they come due, we cannot fully anticipate our future performance or financial condition, the future condition of the credit markets or the economy generally.The Credit Agreement governing the indebtedness incurred by us under our Credit Facility contains certain subsidiary guarantees, which are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all assets directly owned by such subsidiaries and us, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire capital stock or other equity interests, or merge or consolidate with any other person, among various other things.In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios and to prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement in certain cases with proceeds from the issuance of additional debt, asset dispositions, events of loss and excess cash flows. These requirements could limit our cash flow or impair our ability to conduct business and pursue business strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our and their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our debt repayment obligations, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt or bonding agreements. The Credit Agreement also contains a cross-default provision. This provision could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default of a single debt instrument. Our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our debt instruments that could be accelerated upon such an event of default.Further, our level of indebtedness could have important other consequences to our business, including the following:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt service;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;•limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt; or•requiring that we pledge substantial collateral, which may limit flexibility in operating our business and restrict our ability to sell assets.We may elect to borrow, continue or convert certain term or revolving loans under our Credit Agreement to bear interest at an annual rate of one-, three-, six- or, if available, twelve-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plus 2.0% per annum. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.While our Credit Agreement contains “benchmark” transition language to address the phase out of LIBOR that began with the initial phase of the non-publication of LIBOR data in December 2021, LIBOR and other interest rates and other types of indices which are deemed to be financing “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing international regulatory reform. Any changes announced by regulators or any other governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted thereby, regarding the continuing use or method of determining LIBOR rates may impact our interest costs. Although our Credit Agreement provides for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness if LIBOR is not reported, we may be required to amend our Credit Agreement to incorporate alternative benchmark rates. Further, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes regarding an alternative rate or benchmark may adversely affect the value of our variable rate indebtedness or increase our cost of debt.To service our indebtedness and to fund working capital, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that are beyond our control, including the fact that adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital. Our ability to generate cash, outside of funds available through our revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”), is subject to our operational performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other 18factors that are beyond our control. We may be unable to expand our credit capacity, which could adversely affect our operations and business. Earnings from our operations and our working capital requirements can vary from period to period based primarily on the mix of our projects underway and the percentage of project work completed during the period. Capital expenditures may also vary significantly from period to period. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or asset sales or that we can obtain future borrowing capacity in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, to fund working capital requirements or to fund our other liquidity needs. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer.In the event we cannot generate enough cash to satisfy our liquidity needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, restricts our ability to incur additional financing indebtedness. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. The domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets may experience significant volatility, disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability. Should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain such additional funds. If internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms also could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we experience operational difficulties, we may need to increase our available borrowing capacity or seek amendments to the terms of our Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any additional capacity or amendment to our Credit Agreement or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, in which case, our costs of borrowing could rise and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We must manage our liquidity carefully to fund our working capital.The need for working capital for our business varies due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors:•receivables;•contract retentions;•contract assets;•contract liabilities;•the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and•the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors.We may have limited cash on hand and the timing of payments on our contract receivables is difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed or the amount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materially and adversely affected.We may be required to write down all or part of our goodwill and intangibles.We had approximately $262.7 million of goodwill and $299.1 million of intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is separable; that is, it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged (whether there is intent to do so). A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill or intangible assets have been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill and periodic assessments of intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired. On an interim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing. Write downs of goodwill and intangible assets may be substantial. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets in future periods, our net earnings and equity could be materially adversely affected.19Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and internal controls could lead to errors in reporting our financial results.The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, resource challenges and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, otherwise fail to prevent financial reporting misstatements, or if we experience difficulties in implementing internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.

BusinessOverview of the Company’s BusinessSterling Construction Company, Inc. (“Sterling” or “the Company”), operates through a variety of subsidiaries within three segments specializing in Transportation, E-Infrastructure and Building Solutions in the United States (the “U.S.”), primarily across the Southern, Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S., the Rocky Mountain States, California and Hawaii, as well as other areas with strategic construction opportunities. Transportation Solutions includes infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airports, ports, light rail, water, wastewater and storm drainage systems. E-Infrastructure Solutions projects develop advanced, large-scale site development systems and services for data centers, e-commerce distribution centers, warehousing, transportation, energy and more. Building Solutions projects include residential and commercial concrete foundations for single-family and multi-family homes, parking structures, elevated slabs and other concrete work. From strategy to operations, we are committed to sustainability by operating responsibly to safeguard and improve society’s quality of life. Caring for our people and our communities, our customers and our investors – that is The Sterling Way.In this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, “Sterling,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” mean Sterling and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, references to “Note” or “Notes” refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K, unless indicated otherwise.Business StrategySince 2016, our strategic vision has been based on the following elements and objectives:Strategic ElementStrategic ObjectivesSolidifying the baseRisk ReductionGrowing high margin productsBottom-Line GrowthExpansion into adjacent marketsExceed Peer PerformanceBuild a Platform for Future Accretive GrowthSolidifying the base—The Company’s historic base business is our low-bid heavy highway projects within our Transportation Solutions segment. Heavy highway projects typically have gross margins of 7-8%; however, prior to 2016 our gross margin was approximately 4%. In 2016, we implemented a strategy to solidify this base business by improving bid discipline to significantly reduce the probability of project losses. To execute this strategic focus, a key objective, risk reduction, was prioritized. Since the implementation of the strategy and application of the key objective, we have improved the heavy highway backlog gross margin to 9.5% as of December 31, 2021, and we expect gross margins to continue improving as projects bid prior to implementing our strategy come to a completion.Growing high margin products—While solidifying the base is important to the profitability of the Company, the improvement of gross margins is limited due to the highly competitive bidding environment for heavy highway projects. In 2016, we implemented a strategy to shift our project mix from low-bid heavy highway projects to alternative delivery heavy highway projects and other higher margin work (e.g., airports, commercial, piling and shoring). In 2016, our low-bid heavy highway revenue was approximately 79% of our total revenue, but we have progressively brought that down to 19% as of December 31, 2021. The key objective in this strategic area is our focus on bottom-line growth and the higher margin projects we target have gross margins in the range of 12%-15%.Expansion into adjacent markets—In 2016, we implemented a strategy to pursue growth through the acquisition of companies and assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into adjacent markets. Since 2016, we have completed four acquisitions and plan to consider other strategic acquisitions in the future. The companies we target for acquisition typically have gross margins of 15% or more. Specifically, we expanded into adjacent markets and broadened the types of projects we execute through our 2017 acquisition of Tealstone and our recent acquisitions of Plateau, Kimes and Petillo. This strategic focus allows us to broaden our portfolio of products and services, and broaden our end customer base to remain competitive in the markets where we operate. Recent AcquisitionsPetillo Acquisition—On December 30, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Petillo Incorporated and its related entities (collectively, “Petillo”) for aggregate consideration of $204.6 million, consisting of $175.0 million in cash, 759,447 shares of the Company’s common stock, and a target working capital adjustment of $1.4 million. Petillo is a leading specialty site development contractor based in Flanders, New Jersey and serves the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic States, providing large-scale site infrastructure improvement services, including full-service excavation, underground utility construction, 4environmental remediation, drainage systems for commercial construction and water management and distribution systems. The results of Petillo are included within our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment. See Note 3 - Acquisitions for further discussion.Kimes Acquisition—On December 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Kimes & Stone (“Kimes”) for an all-cash purchase price of $7.6 million. Kimes provides a diversified services offering of soil stabilization for site development on e-commerce projects such as large fulfillment and distribution centers and data centers, as well as soil stabilization for roadways and manufacturing plant construction. The transaction includes a fleet of soil stabilization equipment and working capital. The results of Kimes are included within Plateau which is included within our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment.Plateau Acquisition—On October 2, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Plateau Excavation, Inc. and its related entities (collectively, “Plateau”) for aggregate consideration of $427.5 million, consisting of $375.0 million in cash, a working capital adjustment of $21.3 million, 1.25 million shares of the Company’s common stock, a $10.0 million subordinated promissory note that bears interest at 8% and a tax basis election of $5.0 million. Plateau is engaged in executing site development for general contractors and developers on e-commerce projects such as large fulfillment and distribution centers and data centers. The results of Plateau are included within our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment.Segments, Markets and CustomersThe Company’s internal and public segment reporting are aligned based upon the services offered by its operating groups, which represent the reportable segments. With the December 30, 2021 acquisition of Petillo, the Company realigned its operating groups to reflect management’s present oversight of operations. After realignment, the Company’s operations consist of three reportable segments: Transportation Solutions, E-Infrastructure Solutions and Building Solutions, with our commercial business reclassified from the previously reported Specialty Services operating group into our newly formed Building Solutions operating group. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21 - Segment Information for further discussion of our business segments.    Transportation Solutions—Our Transportation Solutions segment is comprised of heavy highway, aviation and rail, and relies heavily on federal and state infrastructure spending. The principal markets of this segment are Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Texas and Utah. Within these principal markets, our core customers are the Departments of Transportation (“DOT(s)”) in various states, regional transit authorities, airport authorities, port authorities, water authorities and railroads. In our Transportation Solutions segment, four state DOTs accounted for 42% of that segment’s revenue in 2021, 44% in 2020 and 43% in 2019.E-Infrastructure Solutions—Our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment serves large, blue-chip end users in the e-commerce, data center, distribution center and warehousing and energy sectors. We are a leading provider of large-scale specialty site infrastructure improvement contracting services in the Southeastern, Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. In our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment, four customers accounted for 58% of that segment’s revenue in 2021 and 44% in 2020.Building Solutions—Our Building Solutions segment is comprised of our residential and commercial businesses. The principal market for our residential business is Texas, specifically the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas and the surrounding communities; and in 2021 we expanded our footprint into Phoenix, Arizona. Our core residential customer base is comprised of leading national home builders as well as regional and custom home builders. Our commercial business focuses on concrete construction of multi-family foundations, parking structures, elevated slabs and other concrete work for leading developers and general contractors in commercial markets. In our Building Solutions segment, four customers, including their respective affiliates, accounted for 57% of that segment’s revenue in 2021, 50% in 2020 and 46% in 2019.We did not have any customers contribute more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2021; however we routinely construct projects for our largest customers mentioned above. If we lost any of these customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Note 19 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures for the Company’s major customers that represent a concentration of risk due to their significant revenue contributions.CompetitionCompetition for our segments ranges from small local contractors to large international construction companies. We traditionally try to position ourselves to bid on work too large for the small local contractors yet too small for the large national and international construction companies. However, if market conditions became less favorable, we would tend to see migration from both the small local contractors and large international players into that mid-level market. This, in return, could increase competitive bidding pressure and reduce both revenue growth and margins. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” for further discussion of risks associated with our competitive environment.5SeasonalityOperations for our segments are typically affected by weather conditions primarily during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which may alter construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues, profitability and the required number of employees. For additional discussion regarding the potential impacts of seasonality on our business, see Item 1A “Risk Factors
—Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity.”ResourcesWe purchase raw materials for our segments, including but not limited to, cement, aggregate, concrete, liquid asphalt, lumber, steel, diesel and gasoline fuel, natural gas and propane from numerous sources. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to fluctuations in market conditions and production capacities.Backlog    Our remaining performance obligations on our projects are referred to as “Backlog” and represent the amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from our contract commitments on projects. The value of our Backlog was $1.49 billion at December 31, 2021, as compared to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2020. We exclude from Backlog contracts where we are the apparent low bidder for projects (“Unsigned Low-bid Awards”) until the contract is executed by our customer (approximately $22.5 million at December 31, 2021). Certain Building Solutions revenue is recognized upon completion at a point in time and therefore is never reflected in our backlog. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Outlook and Trends” for discussion and quantification of our Backlog. Also see Item 1A “Risk Factors
.”ContractsOur contracts are awarded on a competitively bid basis or negotiated bid basis using a range of contracting options, including fixed-unit price, lump sum and cost-reimbursable. Each contract is designed to optimize the balance between risk and reward. At December 31, 2021, substantially all of our backlog was contracted on a fixed-unit price or lump sum basis. We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price.Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain “termination for convenience” clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but require that the Company be paid for work performed through the date of termination. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our types of risk and how we mitigate cancellation and credit risk.Insurance and BondingOur buildings and equipment are covered by insurance, at levels our management believes to be adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability, excess liability, workers’ compensation and auto insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice.As a normal part of the Transportation Solutions business and occasionally with the E-Infrastructure Solutions business, we are required to provide various types of surety and payment bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under the contract. Typically, a bidder for a contract must post a bid bond, generally for 5% to 10% of the bid amount, and on being awarded the bid, must post a performance and payment bond for up to 100% of the costs to construct. Usually, upon posting of the performance bond, a contractor must also post a maintenance bond for generally 1% of the contract amount for one to two years. Our ability to obtain bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, aggregate contract size, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Bonding companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. As is customary, we have agreed to indemnify our bonding company for all losses incurred by it in connection with bonds that are issued, and we have granted our bonding company a security interest in certain assets, including accounts receivable, as collateral for such obligation.6Government and Environmental RegulationsOur operations are subject to compliance with numerous regulatory requirements of federal, state and local agencies and authorities, including regulations concerning safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues, immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of our business. For example, our operations are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws directed toward the protection of employees. In addition, most of our Transportation Solutions construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional governmental requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses.All of our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges into air, water and land, climate change, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. For example, we must apply water or chemicals to reduce dust on road construction projects and to contain contaminants in storm run-off water at construction sites. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous wastes encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the customer. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, impose strict and retroactive joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances.CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur.Solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes, are subject to the requirements of the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, referred to as RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Although we do not generate solid waste, we occasionally dispose of solid waste on behalf of customers. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Moreover, it is possible that additional wastes will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.” Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes.We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance these requirements will not change and compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, tighter regulation for the protection of the environment and other factors may make it more difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist.Human CapitalAt December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 2,900 employees, comprised of approximately 700 salaried employees and approximately 2,200 hourly employees. The percentage of our employees represented by unions at December 31, 2021 was approximately 14%. We have agreements, which we customarily renew periodically, with various unions representing groups of employees at project sites. We consider our relationships with our employees and the applicable labor unions to be satisfactory.Our business is dependent upon a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Substantially all of our employees are hired on a full-time basis; however, as is typical in the construction industry, we experience a high degree of turnover as construction projects are completed. In the past, we have been able to attract a sufficient number of personnel to support the growth of our operations; however, we continue to face competition for experienced workers in all our markets.Our employees are important to the success of our business. Hiring, developing and retaining our employees is not only important, but is a necessity for continued growth and delivery at all levels within our organization. Every employee is critical to the success of our organization and we strive daily to ensure that we are managing our workforce’s needs and requirements. We often work in tight labor markets that make hiring and retaining employees challenging. Therefore, it is critical to have a strategic plan for hiring and managing our workforce. We develop hiring practices by geographic area to ensure a customizable 7recruiting strategy that allows all of our businesses to thrive. Retaining our employees through various means of succession planning and other retention tools is also a critical component of our strategy, particularly for our key positions. Planning for today as well as the future is the cornerstone of our people strategy.Our focus on diversity is at the forefront of how we operate in each of our locations. We strive to instill an inclusive culture that allows all employees the opportunity to thrive. As of December 31, 2021, our workforce was comprised of the following race and ethnicity demographics:Employees as of December 31, 2021Hispanic47.1%White44.2%Black4.0%Pacific Islander2.5%Other2.2%We focus on our safety processes which have allowed us to maintain a high level of safety at our work sites. All project employees receive hazard specific training and our newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation and receive follow-up trainings during their first 90 days of employment. Our project managers and superintendents work closely with the safety department to ensure safety is planned into all of our operations before they begin. Daily, our project foremen are required to conduct safety briefings with employees. Regular safety walkthroughs are conducted by our managers, supervisors and safety staff to evaluate project conditions and observe employee safety behavior. To address the safety and health of our workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional employee health and safety protocols. For the Company’s office-based personnel, the Company is social distancing and, when needed, working from home. For personnel onsite at the Company’s construction sites, the Company has taken mitigation measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including but not limited to, social distancing, wellness checks, providing sanitation stations and wearing personal protective equipment.Access to Company’s FilingsThe Company maintains a website at www.strlco.com on which our latest annual report on Form 10-K, recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, recent current reports on Form 8-K, any amendments to those filings and other filings may be accessed free of charge; some directly on the website and others through a link to the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) where those reports are filed. Our website also has recent press releases, the Company’s code of business conduct, the charters of the audit committee, compensation and talent development committee, and corporate governance and nominating committee of the Board of Directors and information on the Company’s “whistleblower” procedures. Our website content is made available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes, and none of the information on the website is intended to be incorporated into this annual report on Form 10-K by reference.Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below; any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and cash flows. These could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below.Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of our future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.8Risks Relating to Our BusinessIf we do not accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs related to a project when we bid for a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.The majority of our revenues and backlog are derived from fixed-unit price contracts and from lump sum contracts. Fixed-unit price contracts require us to provide materials and services at a fixed-unit price based on agreed quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require the contract work to be completed for a single price irrespective of our actual costs incurred. Our ability to achieve profitability under such contracts is dependent upon our ability to avoid cost overruns by accurately estimating our costs and then successfully controlling our actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, we may incur losses due to cost overruns or the contract may be less profitable than expected. As a result, these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original estimates due to a variety of factors, that may include the following:•onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;•failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;•delays caused by weather conditions;•contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders or contract price adjustments;•changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;•higher than anticipated costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment;•inability to predict the costs of accessing and producing aggregates and purchasing oil required for asphalt paving projects;•availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;•rapidly increasing labor costs;•failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customers to perform their obligations;•fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners, customers or our own personnel;•mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;•citations issued by any governmental authority, including OSHA;•difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;•changes in applicable laws and regulations;•delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during execution of a project; and•claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is a part.Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. Public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain “termination for convenience” clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but require that the Company be remunerated for work performed through the date of termination.We may not accurately assess the quality, and we may not accurately estimate the quantity, availability and cost, of aggregates we need to complete a project, particularly for projects in rural areas.Particularly for projects in rural areas, we may estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for aggregates (such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag and recycled concrete) from sources that we have not previously used as suppliers, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regarding aggregates could result in 9significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delays and other inefficiencies. If we fail to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates, it could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline.We service a significant portion of our contracts with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts.The equipment that we own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to utilize our own facilities to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third party repair services, which could increase our costs.The industry is highly competitive, with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded.In the past, a majority of the contracts on which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other considerations, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer and reputation. Within our geographic markets, we compete with many international, national, regional and local construction firms. Several of these competitors have achieved greater geographic market penetration than we have in the geographic markets in which we compete, and several of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, a number of international and national companies in our industry that are larger than we are and that currently do not have a significant presence in our geographic markets, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our geographic markets and compete with us for contracts.In addition, if the use of design-build, construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced.Our E-Infrastructure Solutions business, as well as the industries of many of our customers upon whom we are dependent, are susceptible to economic downturns, including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth. Demand for our E-Infrastructure Solutions business is cyclical and may be vulnerable to economic downturns, interest rate fluctuations or other adverse developments in the credit markets, and reductions in private industry spending; the effects of which may cause our customers to delay, curtail or cancel proposed and existing projects. A number of factors can adversely affect the industries we serve, including, among other things, financing or credit availability, potential bankruptcies, global and U.S. trade relationships or other geopolitical events. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing for our customers could cause our customers to reduce their spending for our services or affect the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us. Most of our significant contracts can be canceled on short notice.Our contracts generally have clauses that permit the cancellation of the contract unilaterally and at any time as long as the customer pays for the work already completed. A cancellation of an unfinished contract could cause our equipment and work crews to be idle for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The homebuilding industry is cyclical and susceptible to downward changes in general economic or other business conditions which could adversely affect our Building Solutions projects, including foundations for single-family and multi-family homes.The Building Solutions industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of Building Solutions concrete projects we have or reduce the prices we can charge for these projects, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.10We cannot predict with certainty the overall trajectory of the U.S. housing market or the duration of trends due to changes in conditions that are beyond our control, which may include the following:•rising interest rates;•economic downturn or recession;•shortage of lots available for development;•changes in demographics and population migration that impair the demand for new housing;•labor shortages, especially craft labor, and rising costs of labor; and•changes in the tax laws that reduce the benefits of home ownership.We may fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts.In most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to timely complete a project could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract.The design-build project delivery method subjects us to the risk of design errors and omissions.We could be liable for a design error or omission that causes or contributes to damages with respect to one of our design-build projects. Although by contract we pass design responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors and omissions insurance that they and we purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our Transportation Solutions projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Performance problems on existing and future Transportation Solutions contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers.An inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue.As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide bonding to our customers to secure our performance under our contracts. Our ability to obtain bonding primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the credit market. Bonding companies and banks consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the financial markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit the amount that we can bid on new contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.Timing of the award and performance of new contracts may fluctuate.It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as our contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial.The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity.Because all of our construction projects are performed outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to seasonal weather conditions that may delay our work and contribute to project inefficiency. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Extreme heat or cold can prevent us from performing certain types of operations. For example, during the late fall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in the Rocky Mountain States has been curtailed at times due to snow and other work-limiting weather. In addition, our work is subject to extreme and unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, in 2017 11Hurricane Harvey caused damage and disruption that resulted in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days and in some cases several weeks, and the 2021 Texas-wide freezing weather event also caused delays for some of our Transportation Solutions and Building Solutions operations. Future evacuations due to hurricanes along the coastal areas can delay our performance of work on contracts for several days or weeks or longer. Future extreme weather events may also limit the availability of resources, increase our costs or cause our projects to be canceled. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed, and to the extent climate change results in an increase in such extreme adverse weather conditions, the likelihood of a negative impact on our operations may increase.We rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, which are subject to disruption, failure or security breaches.We rely on information technology (“IT”) systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential information on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.The COVID-19 pandemic and any future major public health crisis could disrupt the Company’s operations and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.The COVID-19 pandemic, including new and emerging strains and variants, continues to have adverse effects on the U.S. and global economies. This outbreak, which has continued to spread worldwide, has adversely affected workforces, customers, economies and financial markets globally. While the Company has not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic and any future major public health crisis could impact our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition in the future. For example, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, or government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or any future major public health crisis. However, the significance of the impact on our operations going forward is not yet certain and depends on numerous evolving factors that the Company may not be able to accurately predict or effectively respond to, including, without limitation: the COVID-19 pandemic or any future major public health crisis, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response, the effect on economic activity and actions taken in response, the effect on customers and their demand for the Company’s products and services, the ability of our subcontractors to perform under their contracts due to their own financial or operational difficulties, the availability of subcontractors and other talent, the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the COVID-19 virus or any future major public health crisis, including vaccine efficacy, distribution and widespread public acceptance, and the Company’s ability to continue operations, including without limitation as a result of supply chain challenges, facility closures, social distancing, restrictions on travel, fear or anxiety by the populace and shelter-in-place orders.Risks Related to Our Subcontractors, Suppliers, Joint Venture Partners and CustomersOur dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials (including petroleum-based products) could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all.We rely on third party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our projects and third party suppliers to provide substantially all of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, oil and fuel) for our contracts. Increasing prices of materials and equipment, including due to inflation, and substantial delays in delivering supplies could adversely impact our operations and construction projects. To the extent that we are unable to engage subcontractors or obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a subcontractor or supplier is unable to deliver its services or materials in accordance with the agreed terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services or materials from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract.Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products are utilized to operate the plants and equipment on which we rely to perform our construction contracts. In addition, our asphalt plants and suppliers use oil in combination with aggregates to 12produce asphalt used in our road and highway construction projects. Decreased supplies of such products relative to demand, unavailability of petroleum supplies due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum-based products and other factors can increase the cost of such products. Future increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and the costs of such products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract.Our participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends in part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations.We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduce our profit on a project.Certain counterparties to joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements following a merger or acquisition. Any termination of a joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2021, there was approximately $286.9 million of construction work to be completed on unconsolidated construction joint venture contracts, of which $123.1 million represented our proportionate share. As of December 31, 2021, we are not aware of any situation that would require us to fulfill responsibilities of our joint venture partners pursuant to the joint and several liability under our contracts.We may not be able to recover on claims or change orders against clients for payment or on claims against subcontractors for performance.We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price. Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract without adding new provisions. They generally include changes in specifications or design, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and periods for completion of work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price (or amounts not included in the original contract price) that we seek to collect for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations or other causes of unanticipated additional costs. These costs may or may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. In addition, we may have claims against subcontractors for performance or non-performance related issues that resulted in additional costs on a project. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly document and negotiate a recovery for change orders and claims could have a negative impact on our cash flows and overall ability to recover change orders and claims, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are dependent on a limited number of significant customers.Due to the size and nature of our contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. We are unable to predict whether a customer will have a significant downturn in their business or financial condition. The loss of business or a default or delay in payment from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Risks Related to Our WorkforceOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers for each of our subsidiaries. The loss of the services of any of our subsidiaries’ management-level personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. Our business operations may be further impacted by general labor shortages in 13our industry or markets. If competition for additional employees is intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.In Arizona, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey and New York, a substantial number of our equipment operators and laborers are unionized. Additional groups of our employees may also unionize in the future. If at any time a significant amount of our employees unionized, it could limit the flexibility of the workforce and could result in demands that might increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with unions could result in work stoppages, and any new or extended contracts could result in increased operating costs. Each of our different employee groups could unionize at any time and would require separate collective bargaining agreements. If any group of our employees were to unionize and we were unable to agree on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or we were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by organized labor groups protesting our non-union status. The future or continued occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.If we are unable to comply with applicable immigration laws, our ability to successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted.We rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all undocumented immigrants who work for us. Our failure to identify undocumented immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance as well as negative reputational impacts relating to health and safety matters.Our workers are subject to hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. These operating hazards can cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment, or environmental damage. On most sites, we are responsible for safety and are contractually obligated to implement safety procedures. Our safety record is an important consideration for us and for our customers. If we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, our safety record could substantially deteriorate, which may preclude us from bidding on certain work, expose us to potential lawsuits or cause customers to cancel existing contracts.We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to Regulatory MattersEnvironmental and other regulatory matters, including those relating to climate change, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to 14workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, growing concerns about climate change and other environmental issues could result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Generally, environmental laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could increase our compliance costs. Compliance with new regulations could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities.Our aggregate quarry leases in Utah and Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarries, we could be held responsible for any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarries. Any such costs and liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our construction projects involving concrete.In the recent past, the federal government imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods used in connection with our construction business, including steel and lumber, which raised our costs for these items (or products made with them). Foreign governments, including China and Canada, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. Any trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our costs further, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business and result of operations.Risks Related to Our Transportation Solutions BusinessOur Transportation Solutions business relies on highly competitive and highly regulated state or local government contracts.State and local government funding for public works projects is limited, thus creating a highly competitive environment for the limited number of public projects available. In addition, state and local government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of regulatory requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result, any violations of these regulations could bring about litigation and could cause termination of other existing state or local government contracts and result in the loss of future state or local government contracts. Due to the significant competition in the marketplace and the level of regulations on state or local government contracts, we could suffer reductions in new projects and see lower revenues and profit margins on those projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.Our Transportation Solutions business depends on our ability to qualify as an eligible bidder under state or local government contract criteria and to compete successfully against other qualified bidders in order to obtain state or local government contracts.State and local government agencies conduct rigorous competitive processes for awarding many contracts. Some contracts include multiple award task order contracts in which several contractors are selected as eligible bidders for future work. We will potentially face strong competition and pricing pressures for any additional Transportation Solutions contract awards from other government agencies, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under various multiple award task order contract criteria. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under state or local government contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain other government contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain state or local government contracts and to win those Transportation Solutions contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.15Our Transportation Solutions business is susceptible to economic downturns and reductions in state or local government funding of infrastructure projects.Our business is highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depend on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects. For example, state spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us since we are reliant upon contracts with state transportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues.Refer to our “Business—Segments, Markets and Customers” section within Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of our geographic markets, and refer to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Outlook and Trends” for a discussion of our current expectations regarding federal spending.A prolonged government shutdown may adversely affect our Transportation Solutions business.We derive a significant portion of our Transportation Solutions revenue from governmental agencies and programs. A prolonged government shutdown could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants, approvals, or cause other situations that could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under government contracts, or the delay or cancellation of key government programs in which we are involved, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Risks Related to Recent Acquisitions and StrategyWe expect to continue to incur expenses related to the Petillo Acquisition.We have incurred expenses in connection with completing the Petillo Acquisition on December 30, 2021, and we expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with integrating our business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures with those of Petillo. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses will be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount and the timing of our integration expenses.We may be unable to successfully integrate Petillo’s business with ours and realize the anticipated benefits of the Petillo Acquisition.The Petillo Acquisition previously operated as a private enterprise, whereas we are a public company. We will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Petillo with the Company. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:•lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of the Company or Petillo deciding to terminate or reduce their business with the Company or Petillo following the Petillo Acquisition;•the complexities of combining multiple companies with different histories, regulatory restrictions, operating structures and markets, including geographic location and operating geography;•the failure to retain key employees of the Company or Petillo;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Petillo Acquisition; and•performance shortfalls at the Company or Petillo as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by integrating the companies’ operations.For all these reasons, it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our products, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the Company to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Petillo Acquisition, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be unable to retain key employees.Our success following the Petillo Acquisition will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees of the Company and Petillo. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to uncertainty, changes in workplace responsibilities or demands, or difficulty of integration. Accordingly, we may be unable to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past.16Our strategy, which includes expanding into adjacent markets, may not be successful.We may pursue growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into new markets. We have completed several acquisitions and plan to consider strategic acquisitions in the future. We may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable companies or assets or reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms. Moreover, an acquisition involves certain risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of operations, systems, policies and procedures;•enhancements in controls and procedures including those necessary for a public company may make it more difficult to integrate operations and systems;•failure to implement proper overall business controls, including those required to support our growth, resulting in inconsistent operating and financial practices at companies we acquire or have acquired;•termination of relationships with the key personnel and customers of an acquired company;•additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;•the incurrence of environmental and other liabilities, including liabilities arising from the operation of an acquired business or asset prior to our acquisition for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;•disruption of, or receipt of, insufficient management attention to our ongoing business; and•inability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that we anticipate.Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Financing and LiquidityOur use of over time revenue recognition (formally known as percentage-of-completion method) accounting related to our projects could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported revenue and profits.As is more fully discussed in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Critical Accounting Estimates,” we recognize contract revenue over time. This method is used because management considers the cost-to-cost measure of progress to be the best measure of progress on these contracts.Under this method, estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the cost-to-cost measure of progress for the period (based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and the performance of subcontractors. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These adjustments could result in both increases and decreases in profit margins or losses. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our business. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our Backlog.Backlog as of December 31, 2021 totaled $1.49 billion. Backlog develops as a result of new awards, which represent the potential revenue value realizable pursuant to new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog is measured and defined differently by companies within our industry. We refer to “Backlog” as the unearned revenue we expect to earn in future periods on our executed contracts. As the construction on our projects progresses, we increase or decrease Backlog to take into account newly signed contracts, revenue earned during the period and our estimates of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changed conditions, change orders and other variations from previously anticipated contract revenues, including completion penalties and incentives. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our Backlog will be realized, or if realized, will result in earnings.Given these factors, our Backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our Backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year. Inability to realize revenue from our Backlog could have an adverse effect on our business.17We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as the condition of our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us and makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions.We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral in connection with our Credit Agreement and we have additionally pledged the proceeds of and other rights under our Transportation Solutions and E-Infrastructure Solutions contracts to our bonding agent. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, under our Credit Agreement, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur additional debt from other sources (subject to certain limited exceptions).If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.In connection with the Petillo Acquisition, we incurred a substantial amount of additional indebtedness, and the agreement governing such indebtedness contains various covenants and other provisions that impose restrictions on our ability to operate and manage our business.As a result of borrowing additional funds for the Petillo Acquisition, we have a higher level of indebtedness; specifically, as of December 31, 2021, our aggregate principal amount outstanding under our credit facility (“Credit Facility”) was $446.9 million. The Credit Facility will mature on October 2, 2024. While we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet or refinance our obligations when they come due, we cannot fully anticipate our future performance or financial condition, the future condition of the credit markets or the economy generally.The Credit Agreement governing the additional indebtedness incurred by us in connection with the Petillo Acquisition contains certain subsidiary guarantees, which are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all assets directly owned by such subsidiaries and us, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire capital stock or other equity interests, or merge or consolidate with any other person, among various other things.In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios and to prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement in certain cases with proceeds from the issuance of additional debt, asset dispositions, events of loss and excess cash flows. These requirements could limit our cash flow or impair our ability to conduct business and pursue business strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our and their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our debt repayment obligations, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt or bonding agreements. The Credit Agreement also contains a cross-default provision. This provision could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default of a single debt instrument. Our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our debt instruments that could be accelerated upon such an event of default.Further, our level of indebtedness could have important other consequences to our business, including the following:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt service;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;•limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt; or•requiring that we pledge substantial collateral, which may limit flexibility in operating our business and restrict our ability to sell assets.18We may elect to borrow, continue or convert certain term or revolving loans under our Credit Agreement to bear interest at an annual rate of one-, two-, three-, six- or, if available, twelve-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plus 2.5% per annum. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.While our Credit Agreement contains “benchmark” transition language to address the phase out of LIBOR that began with the initial phase of the non-publication of LIBOR data in December 2021, LIBOR and other interest rates and other types of indices which are deemed to be financing “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing international regulatory reform. Any changes announced by regulators or any other governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted thereby, regarding the continuing use or method of determining LIBOR rates may impact our interest costs. Although our Credit Agreement provides for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness if LIBOR is not reported, we may be required to amend our Credit Agreement to incorporate alternative benchmark rates. Further, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes regarding an alternative rate or benchmark may adversely affect the value of our variable rate indebtedness or increase our cost of debt.To service our indebtedness and to fund working capital, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that are beyond our control, including the fact that adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital. Our ability to generate cash, outside of funds available through our revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”), is subject to our operational performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may be unable to expand our credit capacity, which could adversely affect our operations and business. Earnings from our operations and our working capital requirements can vary from period to period based primarily on the mix of our projects underway and the percentage of project work completed during the period. Capital expenditures may also vary significantly from period to period. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or asset sales or that we can obtain future borrowing capacity in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, to fund working capital requirements or to fund our other liquidity needs. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer.In the event we cannot generate enough cash to satisfy our liquidity needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, restricts our ability to incur additional financing indebtedness. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. The domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets may experience significant volatility, disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability. Should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain such additional funds. If internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms also could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we experience operational difficulties, we may need to increase our available borrowing capacity or seek amendments to the terms of our Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any additional capacity or amendment to our Credit Agreement or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, in which case, our costs of borrowing could rise and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We must manage our liquidity carefully to fund our working capital.The need for working capital for our business varies due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors:•receivables;•contract retentions;•contract assets;•contract liabilities;•the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and•the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors.We may have limited cash on hand and the timing of payments on our contract receivables is difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed or the amount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materially and adversely affected.19We may be required to write down all or part of our goodwill and intangibles.We had approximately $259.8 million of goodwill and $303.2 million of intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is separable; that is, it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged (whether there is intent to do so). A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill or intangible assets have been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill and periodic assessments of intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired. On an interim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing. Write downs of goodwill and intangible assets may be substantial. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets in future periods, our net earnings and equity could be materially adversely affected.Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and internal controls could lead to errors in reporting our financial results.The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, resource challenges and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, otherwise fail to prevent financial reporting misstatements, or if we experience difficulties in implementing internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.

BusinessOverview of the Company’s BusinessSterling Construction Company, Inc. (“Sterling” or “the Company”), operates through a variety of subsidiaries within three segments specializing in Heavy Civil, Specialty Services and Residential projects in the United States (the “U.S.”), primarily across the southern U.S., the Rocky Mountain States, California and Hawaii, as well as other areas with strategic construction opportunities. Heavy Civil includes infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airfields, ports, light rail, water, wastewater and storm drainage systems. Specialty Services projects include construction site excavation and drainage, drilling and blasting for excavation, foundations for multi-family homes, parking structures and other commercial concrete projects. Residential projects include concrete foundations for single-family homes.In this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, “Sterling,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” mean Sterling and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, references to “Note” or “Notes” refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K, unless indicated otherwise.Business StrategySince 2016, our strategic vision has been based on the following elements and objectives:Strategic ElementStrategic ObjectivesSolidifying the baseRisk ReductionGrowing high margin productsBottom-Line GrowthExpansion into adjacent marketsExceed Peer PerformanceBuild a Platform for Future Accretive GrowthSolidifying the base—The Company’s historic base business is our low-bid heavy highway projects within our Heavy Civil segment. Heavy highway projects typically have gross margins of 7-8%; however, prior to 2016 our gross margin was approximately 4%. In 2016, we implemented a strategy to solidify this base business by improving bid discipline to significantly reduce the probability of project losses. Since implementation, we have improved the heavy highway backlog gross margin to 9.6% as of December 31, 2020, and we expect gross margins to continue improving as projects bid prior to implementing our strategy come to a completion.Growing high margin products—While solidifying the base is important to the profitability of the Company, the improvement of gross margins is limited due to the highly competitive bidding environment for heavy highway projects. In 2016, we implemented a strategy to shift our project mix from low-bid heavy highway projects to alternative delivery heavy highway projects and other higher margin work (e.g., airports, commercial, piling and shoring). In 2016, our low-bid heavy highway revenue was approximately 79% of our total revenue, but we have progressively brought that down to 21% as of December 31, 2020. The higher margin projects we target have gross margins in the range of 12%-15%.Expansion into adjacent markets—In 2016, we implemented a strategy to pursue growth through the acquisition of companies and assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into adjacent markets. Since 2016, we have completed two acquisitions and plan to consider other strategic acquisitions in the future. The companies we target for acquisition typically have gross margins of 15% or more. Specifically, we expanded into adjacent markets and broadened the types of projects we execute in 2017 and 2019 through our recent Tealstone and Plateau acquisitions described below.Recent AcquisitionsPlateau Acquisition—On October 2, 2019, we completed our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of LK Gregory Construction, Inc. and Plateau Excavation, Inc., and all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in DeWitt Excavation, LLC (collectively, “Plateau”) for aggregate consideration of $427.5 million, consisting of $375 million in cash, a working capital adjustment of $21.3 million, 1.25 million shares of the Company’s common stock, a $10 million subordinated promissory note that bears interest at 8% and a tax basis election of $5.0 million. To finance the cash portion of the purchase price, we entered into a Credit Agreement, which is further described in Note 9 - Debt. The new Credit Agreement also refinanced and extinguished all of the outstanding indebtedness under our previous Oaktree Facility (entered into in connection with the acquisition of Tealstone, described below).    Plateau is engaged in engineering and executing site development, and their services include surveying, clearing and grubbing, erosion control, grading, grassing, site excavation, storm drainage, sanitary sewer and water main installation, drilling 4and blasting, curb and gutter, paving, concrete work and landfill services, in each case to general contractors and developers engaged in construction services, and engineering services relating thereto. The results of Plateau are included within our Specialty Services segment. See Note 3 - Plateau Acquisition for further discussion.Tealstone Acquisition—On April 3, 2017, we completed our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of Tealstone Commercial, Inc., and Tealstone Residential Concrete, Inc., (collectively, “Tealstone”) from the stockholders thereof (the “Tealstone Sellers”) for consideration totaling $84 million and up to $15 million in aggregate earn-out payments based upon achievement of specified financial performance levels. In conjunction with the acquisition of Tealstone, on April 3, 2017, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as agent, and the lenders party thereto (the “Oaktree Facility”), providing for a term loan of $85 million (the “Loan”) with a maturity date of April 4, 2022, which replaced the then existing debt facility. As noted above, the Credit Agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of Plateau replaced the Oaktree Facility. See Note 9 - Debt for further discussion of our financing arrangements. Tealstone focuses on concrete construction of residential foundations, parking structures, elevated slabs and other concrete work for leading home builders, multi-family developers and general contractors in both residential and commercial markets.Segments, Markets and CustomersThe Company’s internal and public segment reporting are aligned based upon the services offered by its operating groups, which represent the reportable segments. The Company’s operations consist of three reportable segments: Heavy Civil, Specialty Services and Residential. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 21 - Segment Information for further discussion of our business segments.    Heavy Civil—Our Heavy Civil segment relies heavily on federal and state infrastructure spending. The principal markets of this segment are Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Texas and Utah. Within these principal markets, our core customers are the Departments of Transportation (“DOT(s)”) in various states, regional transit authorities, airport authorities, port authorities, water authorities and railroads. In our Heavy Civil segment, four state DOTs accounted for 44% of that segment’s revenue in 2020, 43% in 2019 and 45% in 2018.Specialty Services—Our Specialty Services segment serves large, blue-chip end users in the e-commerce, data center, distribution center and warehousing, energy, mixed use and multi-family sectors. We are a leading provider of large-scale site infrastructure improvement contracting services and believe we are the largest excavating contractor in the Southeastern U.S. In our Specialty Services segment, four customers accounted for 35% of that segments revenue in 2020.Residential—Our Residential segment’s principal market is Texas, specifically the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas and the surrounding communities. The core customer base for our Residential segment is primarily made up of leading national home builders as well as regional and custom home builders. In our Residential segment, four customers, including their respective affiliates, accounted for 83% of that segments revenue in 2020, 75% in 2019 and 72% in 2018.We did not have any customers contribute more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2020, however we routinely construct projects for our largest customers mentioned above. If we lost any of these customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Note 19 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures for the Company’s major customers that represent a concentration of risk due to their significant revenue contributions.CompetitionCompetition for our segments ranges from small local contractors to large international construction companies. We traditionally try to position ourselves to bid on work too large for the small local contractors yet too small for the large national and international construction companies. However, if market conditions became less favorable, we would tend to see migration from both the small local contractors and large international players into that mid-level market. This, in return, could increase competitive bidding pressure and reduce both revenue growth and margins. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” for further discussion of risks associated with our competitive environment.SeasonalityOperations for our segments are typically affected by weather conditions primarily during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which may alter construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues, profitability and the required number of employees. For additional discussion regarding the potential impacts of seasonality on our business, see Item 1A “Risk Factors
—Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity.”5ResourcesWe purchase raw materials for our segments, including but not limited to, cement, aggregate, concrete, liquid asphalt, lumber, steel, diesel and gasoline fuel, natural gas and propane from numerous sources. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to fluctuations in market conditions and production capacities.Backlog    Our remaining performance obligations on our projects are referred to as “Backlog” and represent the amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from our contract commitments on Heavy Civil and Specialty Services projects. The value of our Backlog was $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. We exclude from Backlog contracts for our Heavy Civil segment where we are the apparent low bidder for projects (“Unsigned Low-bid Awards”) until the contract is executed by our customer (approximately $356.9 million at December 31, 2020). Our Residential revenue is recognized upon completion at a point in time and therefore is never reflected in our backlog. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Outlook and Trends” for discussion and quantification of our Backlog. Also see Item 1A “Risk Factors
.”ContractsOur contracts are awarded on a competitively bid basis or negotiated bid basis using a range of contracting options, including fixed-unit price, lump sum and cost-reimbursable. Each contract is designed to optimize the balance between risk and reward. At December 31, 2020, substantially all of our backlog was contracted on a fixed-unit price or lump sum basis. We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price.Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain “termination for convenience” clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but require that the Company be paid for work performed through the date of termination. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our types of risk and how we mitigate cancellation and credit risk.Insurance and BondingOur buildings and equipment are covered by insurance, at levels our management believes to be adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability, excess liability, workers’ compensation and auto insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice.As a normal part of the Heavy Civil business and occasionally with the Specialty Services business, we are required to provide various types of surety and payment bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under the contract. Typically, a bidder for a contract must post a bid bond, generally for 5% to 10% of the bid amount, and on being awarded the bid, must post a performance and payment bond for up to 100% of the costs to construct. Usually, upon posting of the performance bond, a contractor must also post a maintenance bond for generally 1% of the contract amount for one to two years. Our ability to obtain bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, aggregate contract size, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Bonding companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. As is customary, we have agreed to indemnify our bonding company for all losses incurred by it in connection with bonds that are issued, and we have granted our bonding company a security interest in certain assets, including accounts receivable, as collateral for such obligation.Government and Environmental RegulationsOur operations are subject to compliance with numerous regulatory requirements of federal, state and local agencies and authorities, including regulations concerning safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues, immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of our business. For example, our construction operations are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws directed toward the protection of employees. In addition, most of our construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional governmental requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses.All of our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges into air, water and land, climate change, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the 6handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. For example, we must apply water or chemicals to reduce dust on road construction projects and to contain contaminants in storm run-off water at construction sites. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous wastes encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the customer. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, impose strict and retroactive joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances.CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur.Solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes, are subject to the requirements of the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, referred to as RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Although we do not generate solid waste, we occasionally dispose of solid waste on behalf of customers. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Moreover, it is possible that additional wastes will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.” Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes.We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance these requirements will not change and compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, tighter regulation for the protection of the environment and other factors may make it more difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist.Human CapitalAt December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 2,600 employees, comprised of approximately 600 salaried employees and approximately 2,000 hourly employees. The percentage of our employees represented by unions at December 31, 2020 was approximately 13%. We have agreements, which we customarily renew periodically, with various unions representing groups of employees at project sites. We consider our relationships with our employees and the applicable labor unions to be satisfactory.Our business is dependent upon a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Substantially all of our employees are hired on a full-time basis; however, as is typical in the construction industry, we experience a high degree of turnover as construction projects are completed. In the past, we have been able to attract a sufficient number of personnel to support the growth of our operations; however, we continue to face competition for experienced workers in all our markets.Our employees are important to the success of our business. Hiring, developing and retaining our employees is not only important, but is a necessity for continued growth and delivery at all levels within our organization. Every employee is critical to the success of our organization and we strive daily to ensure that we are managing our workforce’s needs and requirements. We often work in tight labor markets that make hiring and retaining employees challenging. Therefore, it is critical to have a strategic plan for hiring and managing our workforce. We develop hiring practices by geographic area to ensure a customizable recruiting strategy that allows all of our businesses to thrive. Retaining our employees through various means of succession planning and other retention tools is also a critical component of our strategy, particularly for our key positions. Planning for today as well as the future is the cornerstone of our people strategy.Our focus on diversity is at the forefront of how we operate in each of our locations. We strive to instill an inclusive culture that allows all employees the opportunity to thrive. 7As of December 31, 2020, our workforce was comprised of the following race and ethnicity demographics:Employees as of December 31, 2020Hispanic50.1%White40.9%Black4.1%Pacific Islander2.2%Other2.7%We focus on our safety processes which have allowed us to maintain a high level of safety at our work sites. All employees receive hazard specific training and our newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation and receive follow-up trainings during their first 90 days of employment. Our project managers and superintendents work closely with the safety department to ensure safety is planned into all of our operations before they begin. Daily, our project foremen are required to conduct safety briefings with employees. Regular safety walkthroughs are conducted by our managers, supervisors and safety staff to evaluate project conditions and observe employee safety behavior. During 2020, to address the safety and health of our workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional employee health and safety protocols. For the Company’s office-based personnel, the Company is social distancing and, where practical, working from home. For personnel onsite at the Company’s construction sites, the Company has taken mitigation measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including but not limited to, social distancing, wellness checks, providing sanitation stations and wearing personal protective equipment.Access to Company’s FilingsThe Company maintains a website at www.strlco.com on which our latest annual report on Form 10-K, recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, recent current reports on Form 8-K, any amendments to those filings, and other filings may be accessed free of charge; some directly on the website and others through a link to the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) where those reports are filed. Our website also has recent press releases, the Company’s code of business conduct, the charters of the audit committee, compensation and talent development committee, and corporate governance and nominating committee of the Board of Directors and information on the Company’s “whistleblower” procedures. Our website content is made available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes, and none of the information on the website is intended to be incorporated into this annual report on Form 10-K by reference.Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below; any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and cash flows. These could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below.Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of our future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.8Risks Relating to Our BusinessIf we do not accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs related to either a Heavy Civil or Specialty Services project when we bid for a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.The majority of our revenues and backlog are derived from fixed-unit price contracts and from lump sum contracts. Fixed-unit price contracts require us to provide materials and services at a fixed-unit price based on agreed quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require the contract work to be completed for a single price irrespective of our actual costs incurred. Given that our revenues per contract are fixed, our ability to achieve contract profitability is dependent upon our ability to avoid cost overruns by accurately estimating our costs and then successfully controlling our actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. As a result, these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original estimates due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:•onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;•failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;•delays caused by weather conditions;•contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders or contract price adjustments;•changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;•higher than anticipated costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment;•inability to predict the costs of accessing and producing aggregates and purchasing oil required for asphalt paving projects;•availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;•rapidly increasing labor costs;•failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customers to perform their obligations;•fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners, customers or our own personnel;•mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;•citations issued by any governmental authority, including OSHA;•difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;•changes in applicable laws and regulations;•delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during execution of a project; and•claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is a part.Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. Public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain “termination for convenience” clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but require that the Company be remunerated for work performed through the date of termination.Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials (including petroleum-based products) could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all.We rely on third party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our projects and third party suppliers to provide substantially all of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, oil and fuel) for our contracts. 9We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the key subcontractors committed for the anticipated scope of the contract and commitments from suppliers for the significant materials required to complete the contract, in each case at prices that we have included in our bid. To the extent that we are unable to engage subcontractors or obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a subcontractor or supplier is unable to deliver its services or materials, in accordance with the agreed terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services or materials from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract.Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products are utilized to operate the plants and equipment on which we rely to perform our construction contracts. In addition, our asphalt plants and suppliers use oil in combination with aggregates to produce asphalt used in our road and highway construction projects. Decreased supplies of such products relative to demand, unavailability of petroleum supplies due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum-based products and other factors can increase the cost of such products. Future increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and the costs of such products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract.Recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our construction projects involving concrete.The federal government has imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with our construction business, including steel, raising our costs for these items (or products made with them), and has threatened to impose further tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on imports. Foreign governments, including China and Canada, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. These trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our construction costs further, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business and result of operations.We may not accurately assess the quality, and we may not accurately estimate the quantity, availability and cost, of aggregates we need to complete a project, particularly for projects in rural areas.Particularly for projects in rural areas, we may estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for aggregates (such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag and recycled concrete) from sources that we have not previously used as suppliers, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regarding aggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delays and other inefficiencies. If we fail to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates, it could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline.We service a significant portion of our contracts with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts.The equipment that we own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to utilize our own facilities to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third party repair services, which could increase our costs.We are dependent on a limited number of significant customers.Due to the size and nature of our contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. The loss of business or a default or delay in payment from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.See Note 19 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures for the Company’s major customers that represent a concentration of risk due to their significant revenue contributions.10The industry is highly competitive, with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded.In the past, a majority of the contracts on which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other considerations, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer and reputation. Within our geographic markets, we compete with many international, national, regional and local construction firms. Several of these competitors have achieved greater geographic market penetration than we have in the geographic markets in which we compete, and several of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, a number of international and national companies in our industry that are larger than we are and that currently do not have a significant presence in our geographic markets, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our geographic markets and compete with us for contracts.In addition, if the use of design-build, CM/GC and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced.Our Heavy Civil business relies on highly competitive and highly regulated state or local government contracts.State and local government funding for public works projects is limited, thus creating a highly competitive environment for the limited number of public projects available. In addition, state and local government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of regulatory requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result, any violations of these regulations could bring about litigation and could cause termination of other existing state or local government contracts and result in the loss of future state or local government contracts. Due to the significant competition in the marketplace and the level of regulations on state or local government contracts, we could suffer reductions in new projects and see lower revenues and profit margins on those projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.Our Heavy Civil business depends on our ability to qualify as an eligible bidder under state or local government contract criteria and to compete successfully against other qualified bidders in order to obtain state or local government contracts.State and local government agencies conduct rigorous competitive processes for awarding many contracts. Some contracts include multiple award task order contracts in which several contractors are selected as eligible bidders for future work. We will potentially face strong competition and pricing pressures for any additional Heavy Civil contract awards from other government agencies, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under various multiple award task order contract criteria. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under state or local government contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain other government contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain state or local government contracts and to win those Heavy Civil contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.Our Heavy Civil business is susceptible to economic downturns and reductions in state or local government funding of infrastructure projects.Our business is highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depend on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects. For example, state spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us since we are reliant upon contracts with state transportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues.Refer to our “Business—Segments, Markets and Customers” section within Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of our geographic markets, and refer to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Outlook and Trends” for a discussion of our current expectations regarding federal spending.11Our Specialty Services business, as well as the industries of many of our customers upon whom we are dependent, is susceptible to economic downturns, including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a new recession. Demand for our Specialty Services business is cyclical and may be vulnerable to economic downturns, interest rate fluctuations or other adverse developments in the credit markets, and reductions in private industry spending, the effects of which may cause our customers to delay, curtail or cancel proposed and existing projects. A number of factors can adversely affect the industries we serve, including, among other things, financing or credit availability, potential bankruptcies, global and U.S. trade relationships or other geopolitical events. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing for our customers could cause our customers to reduce their spending for our services or affect the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us. Most of our significant contracts can be canceled on short notice.Our contracts generally have clauses that permit the cancellation of the contract unilaterally and at any time as long as the customer pays for the work already completed. A cancellation of an unfinished contract could cause our equipment and work crews to be idle for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The homebuilding industry is cyclical and susceptible to downward changes in general economic or other business conditions which could adversely affect our Residential projects, including foundations for single-family and multi-family homes.The Residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of Residential concrete projects we have or reduce the prices we can charge for these projects, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We cannot predict with certainty the overall trajectory of the U.S. housing market or the duration of trends due to changes in conditions that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•Rising interest rates;•Economic recession or downturn;•Shortage of lots available for development;•Changes in demographics and population migration that impair the demand for new housing;•Labor shortages, especially craft labor, and rising costs of labor; and•Changes in the tax laws that reduce the benefits of home ownership.Our participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends in part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations.We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduce our profit on a project.In connection with acquisitions, certain counterparties to joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements. Any termination of a joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2020, there was approximately $522.6 million of construction work to be completed on unconsolidated construction joint venture contracts, of which $234.2 million represented our proportionate share. As of December 31, 2020, we 12are not aware of any situation that would require us to fulfill responsibilities of our joint venture partners pursuant to the joint and several liability under our contracts.We may not be able to recover on claims or change orders against clients for payment or on claims against subcontractors for performance.We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price. Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract without adding new provisions. They generally include changes in specifications or design, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and periods for completion of work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price (or amounts not included in the original contract price) that we seek to collect for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations or other causes of unanticipated additional costs. These costs may or may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. In addition, we may have claims against subcontractors for performance or non-performance related issues which resulted in additional costs on a project. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly document and negotiate a recovery for change orders and claims could have a negative impact on our cash flows and overall ability to recover change orders and claims, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts.In most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to timely complete a project could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract.The design-build project delivery method subjects us to the risk of design errors and omissions.We could be liable for a design error or omission that causes or contributes to damages with respect to one of our design-build projects. Although by contract we pass design responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors and omissions insurance that they and we purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our Heavy Civil projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Performance problems on existing and future Heavy Civil contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers.An inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue.As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide bonding to our customers to secure our performance under our contracts. Our ability to obtain bonding primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the credit market. Bonding companies and banks consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the financial markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit the amount that we can bid on new contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.Timing of the award and performance of new contracts may fluctuate.It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as our contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial.The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.13Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers for each of our subsidiaries. The loss of the services of any of our subsidiaries’ management-level personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. If competition for these employees is intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.In Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada, a substantial number of our equipment operators and laborers are unionized. Additional groups of our employees may also unionize in the future. If at any time, a significant amount of our employees unionized, it could limit the flexibility of the workforce and could result in demands that might increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. Each of our different employee groups could unionize at any time and would require separate collective bargaining agreements. If any group of our employees were to unionize and we were unable to agree on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or we were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by organized labor groups protesting our non-union status. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance as well as negative reputational impacts relating to health and safety matters.Our workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our contracts or not award us future business.Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.If we are unable to comply with applicable immigration laws, our ability to successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted.We rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all undocumented immigrants who work for us. Our failure to identify undocumented immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Environmental and other regulatory matters, including those relating to climate change, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to 14workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Generally, environmental laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities.Our aggregate quarry leases in Utah and Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarries, we could be held responsible for any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarries. Any such costs and liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity.Because all of our construction projects are performed outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey caused damage and disruption that resulted in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days and in some cases several weeks. Future evacuations due to hurricanes along the coastal areas can delay our performance of work on contracts for several days or weeks or longer. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Extreme heat can prevent us from performing certain types of operations. During the late fall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in the Rocky Mountain States may also be curtailed because of snow and other work-limiting weather. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed.We rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, which are subject to disruption, failure or security breaches.We rely on information technology (“IT”) systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential information on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.The COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt the Company’s operations and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the U.S. President announced a National Emergency relating to COVID-19. Federal, state and local authorities have advised social distancing and many imposed shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, including some mandatory business closures. Authorities in some areas of the U.S. began to relax these quarantine and isolation measures in the second quarter of 2020. The country, including areas where the Company does business, later experienced multiple periods of resurgence of the numbers of cases of the virus in both the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Authorities have reacted to these resurgences by deferring the phasing out of these restrictions and in some instances, re-imposing quarantine and isolation measures during the fourth quarter of 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use; however, even with widespread distribution and acceptance of these vaccines, their long-term efficacy is unknown. Consequently, the measures taken have had, and are expected to continue to have, serious adverse effects on the U.S. and global economies of an unknown severity and duration. This outbreak, which has continued to spread worldwide, has adversely 15affected workforces, customers, economies and financial markets globally. While the Company has not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic may impact our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition in the future. However, the significance of the impact on our operations going forward is not yet certain and depends on numerous evolving factors that the Company may not be able to accurately predict or effectively respond to, including, without limitation: the duration and scope of the outbreak, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the outbreak, the effect on economic activity and actions taken in response, the effect on customers and their demand for the Company’s products and services, the ability of our subcontractors to perform under their contracts due to their own financial or operational difficulties, the availability of subcontractors and other talent, the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including vaccine efficacy, distribution and widespread public acceptance, and the Company’s ability to continue operations, including without limitation as a result of supply chain challenges, facility closures, social distancing, restrictions on travel, fear or anxiety by the populace and shelter-in-place orders.Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Financing and LiquidityOur use of over time revenue recognition (formally known as percentage-of-completion method) accounting related to our Heavy Civil and Specialty Services projects could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported revenue and profits.As is more fully discussed in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Critical Accounting Estimates,” we recognize Heavy Civil and Specialty Services contract revenue over time. This method is used because management considers the cost-to-cost measure of progress to be the best measure of progress on these contracts.Under this method, estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the cost-to-cost measure of progress for the period (based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and the performance of subcontractors. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These adjustments could result in both increases and decreases in profit margins or losses. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our business. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our Backlog.Backlog as of December 31, 2020 totaled $1.2 billion for our Heavy Civil and Specialty Services segments. Backlog develops as a result of new awards, which represent the potential revenue value realizable pursuant to new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog is measured and defined differently by companies within our industry. We refer to “Backlog” as the unearned revenue we expect to earn in future periods on our executed Heavy Civil and Specialty Services contracts. As the construction on our projects progresses, we increase or decrease Backlog to take into account newly signed contracts, revenue earned during the period and our estimates of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changed conditions, change orders and other variations from previously anticipated contract revenues, including completion penalties and incentives. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our Backlog will be realized, or if realized, will result in earnings.Given these factors, our Backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our Backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year. Inability to realize revenue from our Backlog could have an adverse effect on our business.We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as the condition of our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us and makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions.16We have pledged the proceeds and other rights under our Heavy Civil and Specialty Services contracts to our bonding agent, and we have pledged substantially all of our other assets as collateral in connection with our Credit Agreement. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, under our Credit Agreement, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur additional debt from other sources (subject to certain limited exceptions).If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.In connection with the Plateau Acquisition, we incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, and the agreements governing such indebtedness contain various covenants and other provisions that impose restrictions on our ability to operate and manage our business.As a result of borrowing funds for the Plateau Acquisition, we have a higher level of indebtedness; specifically, as of December 31, 2020, our aggregate principal amount outstanding under our credit facility (“Credit Facility,” as defined below) was $355 million. The Credit Facility will mature on October 2, 2024. While we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet or refinance our obligations when they come due, we cannot fully anticipate our future performance or financial condition, the future condition of the credit markets or the economy generally.The Credit Agreement governing the indebtedness incurred by us in connection with the Plateau Acquisition contains certain subsidiary guarantees, which are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all assets directly owned by such subsidiaries and us, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire capital stock or other equity interests, or merge or consolidate with any other person, among various other things.In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios and to prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement in certain cases with proceeds from the issuance of additional debt, asset dispositions, events of loss and excess cash flows. These requirements could limit our cash flow or impair our ability to conduct business and pursue business strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our and their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our debt repayment obligations, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt or bonding agreements. The Credit Agreement also contains a cross-default provision. This provision could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default of a single debt instrument. Our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our debt instruments that could be accelerated upon such an event of default.Further, our level of indebtedness could have important other consequences to our business, including the following:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt service;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;•limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt; or•requiring that we pledge substantial collateral, which may limit flexibility in operating our business and restrict our ability to sell assets.We may elect to borrow, continue or convert certain term or revolving loans under our Credit Agreement to bear interest at an annual rate of one-, two-, three-, six- or, if available, twelve-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plus 4.5% per annum. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.The financial industry is currently transitioning away from LIBOR as a benchmark for the interbank lending market. While an orderly transition to a new benchmark is expected, a universal approach has not been adopted. It is uncertain as to the nature of any replacement rate and whether it will gain widespread market acceptance. Because certain loans under our Credit Agreement may bear interest calculated by reference to LIBOR, we may be impacted by this transition, including by:17•the effect of uncertainty regarding the interest rate calculation before replacement benchmark is published regularly and gains widespread market acceptance; or•the risk that differences in the administration or determination methodology of the replacement benchmark may affect the amount of interest payments.Our strategy, which includes expanding into adjacent markets, may not be successful.We may pursue growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into new markets. We have completed several acquisitions and plan to consider strategic acquisitions in the future. We may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable companies or assets or reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms. Moreover, an acquisition involves certain risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of operations, systems, policies and procedures;•enhancements in our controls and procedures including those necessary for a public company may make it more difficult to integrate operations and systems;•failure to implement proper overall business controls, including those required to support our growth, resulting in inconsistent operating and financial practices at companies we acquire or have acquired;•termination of relationships with the key personnel and customers of an acquired company;•additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;•the incurrence of environmental and other liabilities, including liabilities arising from the operation of an acquired business or asset prior to our acquisition for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;•disruption of or receipt of insufficient management attention to our ongoing business; and•inability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that we anticipate.To service our indebtedness and to fund working capital, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that are beyond our control, including the fact that adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital. Our ability to generate cash, outside of funds available through our revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility,” as defined below), is subject to our operational performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may be unable to expand our credit capacity, which could adversely affect our operations and business. Earnings from our operations and our working capital requirements can vary from period to period based primarily on the mix of our projects underway and the percentage of project work completed during the period. Capital expenditures may also vary significantly from period to period. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or asset sales or that we can obtain future borrowing capacity in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, to fund working capital requirements or to fund our other liquidity needs. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer.In the event we cannot generate enough cash to satisfy our liquidity needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, restricts our ability to incur additional financing indebtedness. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. The domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets may experience significant volatility, disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability. Should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain such additional funds. If internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms also could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we experience operational difficulties, we may need to increase our available borrowing capacity or seek amendments to the terms of our Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any additional capacity or amendment to our Credit Agreement or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, in which case, our costs of borrowing could rise and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.18We must manage our liquidity carefully to fund our working capital.The need for working capital for our business varies due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors:•receivables;•contract retentions;•contract assets;•contract liabilities;•the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and•the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors.We may have limited cash on hand and the timing of payments on our contract receivables is difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed or the amount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materially and adversely affected.We may be required to write down all or part of our goodwill and intangibles.We had approximately $192 million of goodwill and $245 million of intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is separable, that is, it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged (whether there is intent to do so). A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill or intangible assets have been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill and periodic assessments of intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired. On an interim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing. Write downs of goodwill and intangible assets may be substantial. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets in future periods, our net earnings and equity could be materially adversely affected.General Risk FactorFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and internal controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting.The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, resource challenges and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, otherwise fail to prevent financial reporting misstatements, or if we experience difficulties in implementing internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.

BusinessOverview of the Company’s BusinessSterling Construction Company, Inc. (“Sterling” or “the Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a construction company that has been involved in the construction industry since its founding in 1955. The Company operates through a variety of subsidiaries within three operating groups specializing in heavy civil, specialty services, and residential projects in the United States (the “U.S.”), primarily across the southern U.S., the Rocky Mountain states, California and Hawaii, as well as other areas with strategic construction opportunities. Heavy civil includes infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airfields, ports, light rail, water, wastewater and storm drainage systems. Specialty services projects include construction site excavation and drainage, drilling and blasting for excavation, foundations for multi-family homes, parking structures and other commercial concrete projects. Residential projects include concrete foundations for single-family homes.In this report, unless the context otherwise indicates, “Sterling,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” mean Sterling and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, references to “Note” or “Notes” refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K, unless indicated otherwise.Recent AcquisitionsPlateau Acquisition—On October 2, 2019, we completed our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of LK Gregory Construction, Inc. and Plateau Excavation, Inc., and all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in DeWitt Excavation, LLC (collectively referred to as “Plateau”) for aggregate consideration of $427.7 million, consisting of $375 million in cash, a working capital adjustment of $21.3 million, 1.24 million shares of the Company’s common stock, a $10 million subordinated promissory note with a fair value discount rate of 8%, and a tax basis election of $5.1 million. To finance the cash purchase price, in conjunction with refinancing and extinguishing all of the outstanding indebtedness of the Company under our previous Oaktree Facility (established during the Tealstone Acquisition, described below), we entered into a Credit Agreement, which is further described in Note 9 - Debt.Plateau is engaged in engineering and executing site development, and their services include surveying, clearing and grubbing, erosion control, grading, grassing, site excavation, storm drainage, sanitary sewer and water main installation, drilling and blasting, curb and gutter, paving, concrete work and landfill services, in each case to general contractors and developers engaged in construction services, and engineering services relating thereto. The results of Plateau are included within our Specialty Services segment. See Note 3 - Plateau Acquisition for further discussion.Tealstone Acquisition—On April 3, 2017, we consummated our acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of Tealstone Commercial, Inc., a Texas corporation and Tealstone Residential Concrete, Inc., a Texas corporation, (collectively, “Tealstone”) (the “Tealstone Acquisition”) from the stockholders thereof (the “Tealstone Sellers”) for consideration totaling $84 million and aggregate of $15 million in earn-out payments based upon achievement of specified financial performance levels. In conjunction with the Tealstone Acquisition, on April 3, 2017, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, had entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as agent, and the lenders party thereto (the “Oaktree Facility”), providing for a term loan of $85 million (the “Loan”) with a maturity date of April 4, 2022, which had replaced the then existing debt facility. As noted above, the Credit Agreement entered into in connection with the Plateau Acquisition replaced the Oaktree Facility. See Note 9 - Debt for further discussion of our financing arrangements. For further discussion regarding the Tealstone Acquisition see Note 2 - Tealstone Acquisition to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 5, 2019.Segments, Markets and CustomersThe Company’s internal and public segment reporting are aligned based upon the services offered by its operating groups, which represent the reportable segments. Due to the October 2, 2019 acquisition of Plateau, the Company realigned its operating groups to reflect management’s present oversight of operations. After realignment, the Company’s operations consist of three reportable segments: Heavy Civil, Specialty Services and Residential, with our commercial business reclassified from the Heavy Civil operating group into our newly formed Specialty Services operating group. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” Note 21 - Segment Information and Note 22 - Quarterly Financial Information for further discussion of our business segments, including the realignment of our business segments after the Plateau Acquisition.Heavy Civil—Our Heavy Civil segment relies heavily on federal and state infrastructure spending. The principal markets of this segment are Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Texas and Utah. Within these principal markets, our core customers are the Departments of Transportation (“DOT(s)”) in various states, regional transit authorities, airport authorities, port authorities, water authorities and railroads.4Currently, our largest customers are Utah, Texas and California DOTs. The Utah DOT contributed more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2019. We routinely construct projects for these customers. If we lost any of these customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Note 19 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures for the Company’s major customers that represent a concentration of risk due to their significant revenue contributions.Specialty Services—Our Specialty Services segment serves large, blue-chip end users in the e-commerce, data center, distribution center and warehousing, energy, mixed use and multi-family sectors. We are a leading provider of large-scale site infrastructure improvement contracting services and believe we are the largest excavating contractor in the Southeastern U.S. Our largest customers in this segment are The Conlan Company, Braesfield & Gorrie and FCL Builders.Residential—Our Residential segment’s principal market is Texas, specifically the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas and the surrounding communities. The core customer base for our Residential segment is primarily made up of leading national home builders as well as regional and custom home builders. Our largest customers are Pulte Group, Inc., D.R. Horton, Inc., Lennar and HISTORYMAKER Homes.CompetitionCompetition for our segments ranges from small local contractors to large international construction companies. We traditionally try to position ourselves to bid on work too large for the small local contractors yet too small for the large national and international construction companies. However, if market conditions became less favorable, we would tend to see migration from both the small local contractors and large international players into that mid-level market. This, in return, could increase competitive bidding pressure and reduce both revenue growth and margins. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” for further discussion of risks associated with our competitive environment.SeasonalityOperations for our segments are typically affected by weather conditions primarily during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which may alter construction schedules and can create variability in our revenues, profitability and the required number of employees.Source and Availability of Raw MaterialsWe purchase raw materials for our segments, including but not limited to, cement, aggregate, concrete, liquid asphalt, steel, diesel and gasoline fuel, natural gas and propane from numerous sources. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to fluctuations in market conditions and production capacities. We do not foresee a lack of availability of any necessary raw materials over the next twelve months.BacklogOur remaining performance obligations on our projects are referred to as “Backlog” and represent the amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from our contract commitments on Heavy Civil and Specialty Services projects. The value of our Backlog was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019, as compared to $850.7 million at December 31, 2018. We exclude from Backlog contracts for our Heavy Civil segment where we are the apparent low bidder for projects (“Unsigned Low-bid Awards”) until the contract is executed by our customer (approximately $273.5 million at December 31, 2019). Our Residential revenue is recognized upon completion at a point in time and therefore is never reflected in our backlog. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Outlook and Trends” for discussion and quantification of our Backlog. See also Item 1A “Risk Factors
”.ContractsOur contracts are awarded on a competitively bid basis or negotiated bid basis using a range of contracting options, including fixed-unit price, lump sum and cost-reimbursable. Each contract is designed to optimize the balance between risk and reward. At December 31, 2019, approximately 70% of our backlog was contracted on a fixed-unit price or lump sum basis. We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price.5Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain “termination for convenience” clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but require that the Company be paid for work performed through the date of termination. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. See Item 1A “Risk Factors
” and Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our types of risk and how we mitigate cancellation and credit risk.Insurance and BondingOur buildings and equipment are covered by insurance, at levels our management believes to be adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability, excess liability, workers’ compensation and auto insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice.As a normal part of the Heavy Civil business and occasionally with the Specialty Services business, we are required to provide various types of surety and payment bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under the contract. Typically, a bidder for a contract must post a bid bond, generally for 5% to 10% of the bid amount, and on being awarded the bid, must post a performance and payment bond for up to 100% of the costs to construct. Usually, upon posting of the performance bond, a contractor must also post a maintenance bond for generally 1% of the contract amount for one to two years. Our ability to obtain bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, aggregate contract size, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Bonding companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. As is customary, we have agreed to indemnify our bonding company for all losses incurred by it in connection with bonds that are issued, and we have granted our bonding company a security interest in certain assets, including accounts receivable, as collateral for such obligation.Government and Environmental RegulationsOur operations are subject to compliance with numerous regulatory requirements of federal, state and local agencies and authorities, including regulations concerning safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues, immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of our business. For example, our construction operations are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws directed toward the protection of employees. In addition, most of our construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional governmental requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses.All of our operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges into air, water and land, climate change, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. For example, we must apply water or chemicals to reduce dust on road construction projects and to contain contaminants in storm run-off water at construction sites. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous wastes encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the customer. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, impose strict and retroactive joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances.CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and, in some instances, third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur.Solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes, are subject to the requirements of the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, referred to as RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Although we do not generate solid waste, we occasionally dispose of solid waste on behalf of customers. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Moreover, it is possible that additional wastes will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.” Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes.6We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance these requirements will not change and compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, tighter regulation for the protection of the environment and other factors may make it more difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist.EmployeesAt December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately 2,800 employees, comprised of approximately 700 salaried employees and approximately 2,100 hourly employees. The percentage of our employees represented by unions at December 31, 2019 was approximately 15%. We have agreements, which we customarily renew periodically, with various unions representing groups of employees at project sites. We consider our relationships with our employees and the applicable labor unions to be satisfactory.Our business is dependent upon a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Substantially all of our employees are hired on a full-time basis; however, as is typical in the construction industry, we experience a high degree of turnover as construction projects are completed. In the past, we have been able to attract sufficient numbers of personnel to support the growth of our operations, however, we continue to face competition for experienced workers in all our markets.We focus on our safety processes which have allowed us to maintain a high level of safety at our work sites. All employees receive hazard specific training and our newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation and receive follow-up trainings during their first 90 days of employment. Our project managers and superintendents work closely with the safety department to ensure safety is planned into all of our operations before they begin. Daily, our project foremen are required to conduct safety briefings with employees. Regular safety walkthroughs are conducted by our managers, supervisors and safety staff to evaluate project conditions and observe employee safety behavior.Access to Company’s FilingsThe Company maintains a website at www.strlco.com on which our latest annual report on Form 10-K, recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, recent current reports on Form 8-K, any amendments to those filings, and other filings may be accessed free of charge; some directly on the website and others through a link to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) website (www.sec.gov) where those reports are filed. Our website also has recent press releases, the Company’s code of business conduct, the charters of the audit committee, compensation and talent development committee, and corporate governance and nominating committee of the Board of Directors and information on the Company’s “whistleblower” procedures. Our website content is made available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes, and none of the information on the website is incorporated into this annual report on Form 10-K by this reference to it.Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below; any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and cash flows. These could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below.Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of our future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.7Risks Relating to Our BusinessIf we do not accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs related to either a Heavy Civil or Specialty Services project when we bid for a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.The majority of our revenues and backlog are derived from fixed-unit price contracts and from lump sum contracts. Fixed-unit price contracts require us to provide materials and services at a fixed-unit price based on agreed quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require the contract work to be completed for a single price irrespective of our actual costs incurred. Given that our revenues per contract are fixed, our ability to achieve contract profitability is dependent upon our ability to avoid cost overruns by accurately estimating our costs and then successfully controlling our actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. As a result, these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original estimates due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:•onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;•failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;•delays caused by weather conditions;•contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders or contract price adjustments;•changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;•higher than anticipated costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment;•inability to predict the costs of accessing and producing aggregates and purchasing oil required for asphalt paving projects;•availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;•rapidly increasing labor costs;•failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customers to perform their obligations;•fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners, customers or our own personnel;•mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;•citations issued by any governmental authority, including OSHA;•difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;•changes in applicable laws and regulations;•delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during execution of a project; and•claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is a part.Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. Public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain “termination for convenience” clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but require that the Company be remunerated for work performed through the date of termination; we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past.8Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials (including petroleum-based products) could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all.We rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our projects and third party suppliers to provide substantially all of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, oil and fuel) for our contracts. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the key subcontractors committed for the anticipated scope of the contract and commitments from suppliers for the significant materials required to complete the contract, in each case at prices that we have included in our bid. To the extent that we are unable to engage subcontractors or obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a subcontractor or supplier is unable to deliver its services or materials, in accordance with the agreed terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services or materials from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract.Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products are utilized to operate the plants and equipment on which we rely to perform our construction contracts. In addition, our asphalt plants and suppliers use oil in combination with aggregates to produce asphalt used in our road and highway construction projects. Decreased supplies of such products relative to demand, unavailability of petroleum supplies due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum-based products and other factors can increase the cost of such products. Future increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and the costs of such products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract.Recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our construction projects involving concrete.The federal government has imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with our construction business, including steel, raising our costs for these items (or products made with them), and has threatened to impose further tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on imports. Foreign governments, including China and Canada, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. These trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our construction costs further, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business and result of operations.We may not accurately assess the quality, and we may not accurately estimate the quantity, availability and cost, of aggregates we need to complete a project, particularly for projects in rural areas.Particularly for projects in rural areas, we may estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for aggregates (such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag and recycled concrete) from sources that we have not previously used as suppliers, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regarding aggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delays and other inefficiencies. If we fail to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates, it could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline.We service a significant portion of our contracts with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts.The equipment that we own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to utilize our own facilities to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third-party repair services, which could increase our costs.9We are dependent on a limited number of significant customers.Heavy Civil and Specialty Services—Due to the size and nature of our contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. Our significant Heavy Civil customers (i.e., those greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues) accounted for approximately 12% of our revenue in 2019, 15% of our revenue in 2018 and 25% of our revenue in 2017. There were no Specialty Services customers with revenue greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2019. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See Note 19 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures for the Company’s major customers that represent a concentration of risk due to their significant revenue contributions. See also Note 3 - Plateau Acquisition for additional detail regarding the Plateau Acquisition during 2019 and the creation of our Specialty Services segment.Residential—Customers for our residential business are leading Residential homebuilders. Several of these customers individually account for a significant portion of our Residential business’s sales in a normal year. In our Residential business, D.R. Horton Inc., Pulte Homes Inc., HISTORYMAKER Homes, and Lennar, including their respective affiliates, accounted for approximately 75%, 72% and 67% of our revenue for the residential segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, homebuilders are reliant upon growth in the housing market and the continued ability to purchase and develop land, which ultimately impact customers’ demand for our Residential services. The loss of any one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The industry is highly competitive, with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded.In the past, a majority of the contracts on which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other considerations, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer and reputation. Within our geographic markets, we compete with many international, national, regional and local construction firms. Several of these competitors have achieved greater geographic market penetration than we have in the geographic markets in which we compete, and several of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, a number of international and national companies in our industry that are larger than we are and that currently do not have a significant presence in our geographic markets, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our geographic markets and compete with us for contracts.In addition, if the use of design-build, CM/GC and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced.A prolonged government shutdown may adversely affect our Heavy Civil business.We derive a significant portion of our Heavy Civil revenue from governmental agencies and programs. A prolonged government shutdown could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants, approvals, or cause other situations that could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under government contracts, or the delay or cancellation of key government programs in which we are involved, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our Heavy Civil business relies on highly competitive and highly regulated government contracts.Government funding for public works projects is limited, thus creating a highly competitive environment for the limited number of public projects available. In addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of regulatory requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result, any violations of these regulations could bring about litigation, including the possibility of qui tam (“Whistleblower”) litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, and could cause termination of other existing government contracts and result in the loss of future government contracts. Due to the significant competition in the marketplace and the level of regulations on government contracts, we could suffer reductions in new projects and see lower revenues and profit margins on those projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.10Our Heavy Civil business depends on our ability to qualify as an eligible bidder under government contract criteria and to compete successfully against other qualified bidders in order to obtain government contracts.The U.S. government and various state and local government agencies conduct rigorous competitive processes for awarding many contracts. Some contracts include multiple award task order contracts in which several contractors are selected as eligible bidders for future work. We will face strong competition and pricing pressures for any additional Heavy Civil contract awards from the U.S. government and other government agencies, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under various multiple award task order contract criteria. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under government contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain government contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain government contracts and to win those Heavy Civil contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.Our Heavy Civil business is susceptible to economic downturns and reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects.Our business is highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects. For example, state spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us since we are reliant upon contracts with state transportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues.Refer to our “Business—Segments, Markets and Customers” section within Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of our geographic markets.Our Specialty Services business, as well as the industries of many of our customers upon whom we are dependent, is susceptible to economic downturns, including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a new recession. Demand for our Specialty Services business is cyclical and may be vulnerable to economic downturns, interest rate fluctuations or other adverse developments in the credit markets, and reductions in private industry spending, the effects of which may cause our customers to delay, curtail or cancel proposed and existing projects. A number of factors can adversely affect the industries we serve, including, among other things, financing or credit availability, potential bankruptcies, global and U.S. trade relationships or other geopolitical events. A reduction in cash flow or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing for our customers could cause our customers to reduce their spending for our services or affect the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us. Most of our significant contracts can be canceled on short notice.Our contracts generally have clauses that permit the cancellation of the contract unilaterally and at any time as long as the customer pays for the work already completed. A cancellation of an unfinished contract could cause our equipment and work crews to be idle for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The homebuilding industry is cyclical and susceptible to downward changes in general economic or other business conditions which could adversely affect our Residential projects, including foundations for single-family and multi-family homes.The Residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of Residential concrete projects we have or reduce the prices we can charge for these projects, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.Although the U.S. housing market continues to recover, especially in the markets currently served by us, we cannot predict with certainty the overall trajectory of these markets or the duration of this trend due to changes in conditions that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•Rising interest rates;•Shortage of lots available for development;•Changes in demographics and population migration that impair the demand for new housing;•Labor shortages, especially craft labor, and rising costs of labor; and•Changes in the tax laws that reduce the benefits of home ownership.11Our participation in Heavy Civil joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends in part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations.We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduce our profit on a project.In connection with acquisitions, certain counterparties to joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements. Any termination of a joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may not be able to recover on claims or change orders against clients for payment or on claims against subcontractors for performance.We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price. Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract without adding new provisions. They generally include changes in specifications or design, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and periods for completion of work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price (or amounts not included in the original contract price) that we seek to collect for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations or other causes of unanticipated additional costs. These costs may or may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. In addition, we may have claims against subcontractors for performance or non-performance related issues which resulted in additional costs on a project. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly document and negotiate a recovery for change orders and claims could have a negative impact on our cash flows and overall ability to recover change orders and claims, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts.In most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to timely complete a project could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract.The design-build project delivery method subjects us to the risk of design errors and omissions.We could be liable for a design error or omission that causes or contributes to damages with respect to one of our design-build projects. Although by contract we pass design responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors and omissions insurance that they and we purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our Heavy Civil projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Performance problems on existing and future Heavy Civil contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers.An inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue.As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide bonding to our customers to secure our performance under our contracts. Our ability to obtain bonding primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the credit market. Bonding companies and banks consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the financial markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit the amount that we can bid on new contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.12Timing of the award and performance of new contracts may fluctuate.It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as our contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial.The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.We may be unable to attract and retain project managers, skilled labor and other key personnel.Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers for each of our subsidiaries. The loss of the services of any of our subsidiaries’ management-level personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. If competition for these employees is intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted.We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.In Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada a substantial number of our equipment operators and laborers are unionized. Additional groups of our employees may also unionize in the future. If at any time, a significant amount of our employees unionized, it could limit the flexibility of the workforce and could result in demands that might increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. Each of our different employee groups could unionize at any time and would require separate collective bargaining agreements. If any group of our employees were to unionize and we were unable to agree on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or we were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by organized labor groups protesting our non-union status. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance as well as negative reputational impacts relating to health and safety matters.Our workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our contracts or not award us future business.Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.13If we are unable to comply with applicable immigration laws, our ability to successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted.We rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all undocumented immigrants who work for us. Our failure to identify undocumented immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Generally, environmental laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities.Our aggregate quarry leases in Utah and Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarries, we could be held responsible for any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarries. Any such costs and liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity.Because all of our construction projects are performed outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey caused damage and disruption that resulted in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days and in some cases several weeks. Future evacuations due to hurricanes along the coastal areas can delay our performance of work on contracts for several days or weeks or longer. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Extreme heat can prevent us from performing certain types of operations. During the late fall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in the Rocky Mountain states may also be curtailed because of snow and other work-limiting weather. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed.We rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, which are subject to disruption, failure or security breaches.We rely on information technology (“IT”) systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential information on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.14Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Financing and LiquidityOur use of over time revenue recognition (formally known as percentage-of-completion method) accounting related to our Heavy Civil and Specialty Services projects could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported revenue and profits.As is more fully discussed in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates,” we recognize Heavy Civil and Specialty Services contract revenue over time. This method is used because management considers the cost-to-cost measure of progress to be the best measure of progress on these contracts.Under this method, estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the cost-to-cost measure of progress for the period (based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and the performance of subcontractors. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These adjustments could result in both increases and decreases in profit margins or losses. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our business. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our Backlog.Backlog as of December 31, 2019 totaled $1.1 billion for our Heavy Civil and Specialty Services segments. Backlog develops as a result of new awards, which represent the potential revenue value realizable pursuant to new project commitments received by us during a given period. Backlog is measured and defined differently by companies within our industry. We refer to “Backlog” as the unearned revenue we expect to earn in future periods on our executed Heavy Civil and Specialty Services contracts. As the construction on our projects progresses, we increase or decrease Backlog to take into account newly signed contracts, revenue earned during the period and our estimates of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changed conditions, change orders and other variations from previously anticipated contract revenues, including completion penalties and incentives. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our Backlog will be realized, or if realized, will result in earnings. Given these factors, our Backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our Backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year. Inability to realize revenue from our Backlog could have an adverse effect on our business.We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as the condition of our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us and makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions.We have pledged the proceeds and other rights under our Heavy Civil and Specialty Services contracts to our bonding agent, and we have pledged substantially all of our other assets as collateral in connection with our Credit Agreement. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, under our Credit Agreement, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur additional debt from other sources (subject to certain limited exceptions).If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.In connection with the Plateau Acquisition, we incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, and the agreements governing such indebtedness contain various covenants and other provisions that impose restrictions on our ability to operate and manage our business.As a result of borrowing funds for the Plateau Acquisition, we have a higher level of indebtedness; specifically, as of December 31, 2019, our aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Credit Facility was $420 million. The Credit Facility will mature on October 2, 2024. While we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet or refinance our obligations 15when they come due, we cannot fully anticipate our future performance or financial condition, the future condition of the credit markets or the economy generally.The Credit Agreement governing the indebtedness incurred by us in connection with the Plateau Acquisition contains certain subsidiary guarantees, which are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all assets directly owned by such subsidiaries and us, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire capital stock or other equity interests, or merge or consolidate with any other person, among various other things.In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios and to prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement in certain cases with proceeds from the issuance of additional debt, asset dispositions, events of loss and excess cash flows. These requirements could limit our cash flow or impair our ability to conduct business and pursue business strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our and their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our debt repayment obligations, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt or bonding agreements. The Credit Agreement also contains a cross-default provision. This provision could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default of a single debt instrument. Our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our debt instruments that could be accelerated upon such an event of default.Further, our level of indebtedness could have important other consequences to our business, including the following:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt service;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;•limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt; or•requiring that we pledge substantial collateral, which may limit flexibility in operating our business and restrict our ability to sell assets.We may elect to borrow, continue or convert certain term or revolving loans under our Credit Agreement to bear interest at an annual rate of one-, two-, three-, six- or, if available, twelve-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plus 4.5% per annum. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.The financial industry is currently transitioning away from LIBOR as a benchmark for the interbank lending market. While an orderly transition to a new benchmark is expected, a universal approach has not been adopted. It is uncertain as to the nature of any replacement rate and whether it will gain widespread market acceptance. Because certain loans under our Credit Agreement may bear interest calculated by reference to LIBOR, we may be impacted by this transition, including by:•the effect of uncertainty regarding the interest rate calculation before replacement benchmark is published regularly and gains widespread market acceptance; or•the risk that differences in the administration or determination methodology of the replacement benchmark may affect the amount of interest payments.Our strategy, which includes growing through strategic acquisitions, may not be successful.We may pursue growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into new markets. We have completed several acquisitions and plan to consider strategic acquisitions in the future. We may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable companies or assets or reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms. Moreover, an acquisition involves certain risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of operations, systems, policies and procedures;•enhancements in our controls and procedures including those necessary for a public company may make it more difficult to integrate operations and systems;16•failure to implement proper overall business controls, including those required to support our growth, resulting in inconsistent operating and financial practices at companies we acquire or have acquired;•termination of relationships with the key personnel and customers of an acquired company;•additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;•the incurrence of environmental and other liabilities, including liabilities arising from the operation of an acquired business or asset prior to our acquisition for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;•disruption of or receipt of insufficient management attention to our ongoing business; and•inability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that we anticipate.To service our indebtedness and to fund working capital, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that are beyond our control, including the fact that adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital. Our ability to generate cash, outside of funds available through our Revolving Credit Facility, is subject to our operational performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may be unable to expand our credit capacity, which could adversely affect our operations and business. Earnings from our operations and our working capital requirements can vary from period to period based primarily on the mix of our projects underway and the percentage of project work completed during the period. Capital expenditures may also vary significantly from period to period. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or asset sales or that we can obtain future borrowing capacity in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, to fund working capital requirements or to fund our other liquidity needs. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer.In the event we cannot generate enough cash to satisfy our liquidity needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, restricts our ability to incur additional financing indebtedness. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. The domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets may experience significant volatility, disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability. Should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain such additional funds. If internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms also could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we experience operational difficulties, we may need to increase our available borrowing capacity or seek amendments to the terms of our Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any additional capacity or amendment to our Credit Agreement or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, in which case, our costs of borrowing could rise and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We must manage our liquidity carefully to fund our working capital.The need for working capital for our business varies due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors:•receivables and contract retentions;•costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings;•billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings;•the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and•the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors.We may have limited cash on hand and the timing of payments on our contract receivables is difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed or the amount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materially and adversely affected.17We may be required to write down all or part of our goodwill and intangibles.We had $192 million of goodwill and $256 million of intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is separable, that is, it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged (whether there is intent to do so). A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill or intangible assets have been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill and periodic assessments of intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired. On an interim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing. Write downs of goodwill and intangible assets may be substantial. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets in future periods, our net earnings and equity could be materially adversely affected.Risks Related to the Plateau AcquisitionWe expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to the Plateau Acquisition.We have incurred substantial expenses in connection with completing the Plateau Acquisition on October 2, 2019, and we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating our business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures with those of Plateau. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of our integration expenses.We may be unable to successfully integrate Plateau’s business with ours and realize the anticipated benefits of the Plateau Acquisition.The Plateau Acquisition previously operated as a private enterprise, whereas we are a public company. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Plateau with the Company. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:•lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of the Company or Plateau deciding to terminate or reduce their business with the Company or Plateau following the Plateau Acquisition;•the complexities of combining multiple companies with different histories, regulatory restrictions, operating structures and markets, including geographic location and operating geography;•the failure to retain key employees of the Company or Plateau;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Plateau Acquisition; and•performance shortfalls at the Company or Plateau as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the Plateau Acquisition and integrating the companies’ operations.For all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our products, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the Company to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Plateau Acquisition, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be unable to retain key employees.Our success following the Plateau Acquisition will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees of the Company and Plateau. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to uncertainty, changes in workplace responsibilities or demands, or difficulty of integration. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past"
5,STRL,STERLING CONSTRUCTION CO INC,2019-03-05,"Risk Factors
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below; any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and cash flows. These could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below.Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of our future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Risks Relating to Our Business If we do not accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs related to a heavy civil project when we bid on or negotiate a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract. The majority of our revenues and backlog are derived from fixed unit price contracts and from lump sum contracts. Fixed unit price contracts require us to provide materials and services at a fixed unit price based on agreed quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require the contract work to be completed for a single price irrespective of our actual costs incurred. Given that our revenues per contract are fixed, our ability to achieve contract profitability is dependent upon our ability to avoid cost overruns by accurately estimating our costs and then successfully controlling our actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. As a result, these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position. The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original estimates due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: •onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;•failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;•delays caused by weather conditions;•contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders or contract price adjustments;•changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;•higher than anticipated costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment;•inability to predict the costs of accessing and producing aggregates and purchasing oil required for asphalt paving projects;•availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;•rapidly increasing labor costs;•failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customers to perform their obligations;•fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners, customers or our own personnel;•mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;•citations issued by any governmental authority, including OSHA;•difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;•changes in applicable laws and regulations;•delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during execution of a project; and•claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is apart.10Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. Public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.Substantially all of the contracts in our Backlog contain ""termination for convenience"" clauses which allow the customer to cancel the contract at their election but require that the Company be remunerated for work performed through the date of termination; we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past. See the section below entitled, “Heavy Civil Construction Contracts — Contract Management Process.”Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials (including petroleum-based products) could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all. We rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our projects and third party suppliers to provide most of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, oil and fuel) for our contracts. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the key subcontractors committed for the anticipated scope of the contract and commitments from suppliers for the significant materials required to complete the contract, and at prices that we have included in our bid. Therefore, to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a subcontractor or supplier is unable to deliver its services or materials, according to the negotiated terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services or materials from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract. Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products are utilized to operate the plants and equipment on which we rely to perform our construction contracts. In addition, our asphalt plants and suppliers use oil in combination with aggregates to produce asphalt used in our road and highway construction projects. Decreased supplies of such products relative to demand, unavailability of petroleum supplies due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum-based products and other factors can increase the cost of such products. Future increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and the costs of such products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract.Recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our heavy civil and residential concrete construction projects.The federal government recently imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with our construction business, including steel, raising our costs for these items (or products made with them), and has threatened to impose further tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on imports. Foreign governments, including China and Canada, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. These trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our construction costs further, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business and result of operations.We may not accurately assess the quality, and we may not accurately estimate the quantity, availability and cost, of aggregates we need to complete a project, particularly for projects in rural areas. Particularly for projects in rural areas, we may estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for aggregates (such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag and recycled concrete) from sources that we have not previously used to supply aggregates, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regarding aggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delays and other inefficiencies. If we fail to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates, it could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.11We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline. We service a significant portion of our contracts with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts. The equipment that we own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to utilize our own facilities to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third-party repair services, which could increase our costs. We are dependent on a limited number of heavy civil construction customers. Due to the size and nature of our heavy civil construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. Our significant heavy civil customers, those greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues, accounted for approximately 15% of our revenue in 2018, 25% of our revenue in 2017 and 37% of our revenue in 2016. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  See Note 16 - Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures.The heavy civil construction industry is highly competitive, with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded. In the past, a majority of the heavy civil construction contracts on which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other factors, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer. For our design-build, CM/GC and other alternative methods of delivering projects, reputation, marketing efforts, quality of design and minimizing public inconvenience are also significant factors considered in awarding heavy civil construction contracts, in addition to cost. Within our geographic markets, we compete with many international, national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors have achieved greater geographic market penetration than we have in the geographic markets in which we compete, and several of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, a number of international and national companies in our industry that are larger than we are and that currently do not have a significant presence in our geographic markets, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our geographic markets and compete with us for contracts. In addition, if the use of design-build, CM/GC and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced.A prolonged government shutdown may adversely affect our business.We derive a significant portion of our heavy civil construction revenue from governmental agencies and programs. A prolonged government shutdown could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants, approvals, or cause other situations that could result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under government contracts, or the delay or cancellation of key government programs in which we are involved, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.12Our heavy civil construction business relies on highly competitive and highly regulated government contracts.Government funding for public works projects is limited, thus creating a highly competitive environment for the limited number of public projects available. In addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of regulatory requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result, any violations of these regulations could bring about litigation, including the possibility of qui tam (“Whistleblower”) litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, and could cause termination of other existing government contracts and result in the loss of future government contracts. Due to the significant competition in the marketplace and the level of regulations on government contracts, we could suffer reductions in new projects and see lower revenues and profit margins on those projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.Our heavy civil construction business depends on our ability to qualify as an eligible bidder under government contract criteria and to compete successfully against other qualified bidders in order to obtain government contracts within our heavy civil business.The U.S. government and various state and local government agencies conduct rigorous competitive processes for awarding many contracts. Some contracts include multiple award task order contracts in which several contractors are selected as eligible bidders for future work. We will face strong competition and pricing pressures for any additional heavy civil construction contract awards from the U.S. government and other government agencies, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under various multiple award task order contract criteria. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under government contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain government contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain government contracts and to win those heavy civil construction contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.Our heavy civil construction business is susceptible to economic downturns and reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects. Our business is highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects. For example, state spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us since we are reliant upon contracts with state transportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues. Refer to our “Business - Our Markets and Customers” section above for a more detailed discussion of our geographic markets.Most of our significant heavy civil construction contracts can be canceled on short notice. Our governmental contracts generally have clauses that permit the government to cancel the heavy civil construction contract unilaterally and at any time as long as the government pays for the work already completed. A cancellation of an unfinished contract could cause our equipment and work crews to be idle for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The homebuilding industry is cyclical and susceptible to downward changes in general economic or other business conditions which could adversely affect our residential construction projects, including foundations for single-family and multi-family homes.           The residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of concrete projects we construct or reduce the prices we can charge for these projects, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.13Although the U.S. housing market continues to recover, especially in the markets currently served by us, we cannot predict with certainty the overall trajectory of these markets or the duration of this trend due to changes in conditions that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:•Rising interest rates;•Shortage of lots available for development;•Changes in demographics and population migration that impair the demand for new housing;•Labor shortages, especially craft labor, and rising costs of labor; and•Changes in the tax laws that reduce the benefits of home ownership.Our participation in heavy civil construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends in part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduce our profit on a project. In connection with acquisitions, certain counterparties to joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements. Any termination of a joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may not be able to recover on claims or change orders against clients for payment or on claims against subcontractors for performance.We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price. Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract without adding new provisions. They generally include changes in specifications or design, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and periods for completion of work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price (or amounts not included in the original contract price) that we seek to collect for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations or other causes of unanticipated additional costs. These costs may or may not be recovered until the claim is resolved.  In addition, we may have claims against subcontractors for performance or non-performance related issues which resulted in additional costs on a project. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly document and negotiate a recovery for change orders and claims could have a negative impact on our cash flows and overall ability to recover change orders and claims, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our heavy civil contracts. In most cases, our heavy civil construction contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to timely complete a project could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract.14The design-build project delivery method subjects us to the risk of design errors and omissions. In the event of a design error or omission causing damages with respect to one of our design-build projects, we could be liable. Although by contract we pass design responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors and omissions insurance that they and we purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our heavy civil construction projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Performance problems on existing and future heavy civil construction contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers.An inability to obtain bonding or post letters of credit could limit the aggregate dollar amount of heavy civil contracts that we are able to pursue. As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide surety bonds or letters of credit to our customers to secure our performance under heavy civil construction contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds or letters of credit primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, available credit facilities, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety and letter of credit market. Surety companies and banks consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets and the banking markets generally may result in bonding or letters of credit becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding or letters of credit would limit the amount that we can bid on new contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.Timing of the award and performance of new heavy civil contracts may fluctuate. It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as our heavy civil construction contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial. The uncertainty of the timing of heavy civil construction contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.We may be unable to attract and retain project managers, skilled labor and other key personnel. Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes for each of our subsidiaries management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers. The loss of the services of any of our subsidiaries' management-level personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. If competition for these employees is intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted.We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.In Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada a substantial number of our equipment operators and laborers are unionized. Additional groups of our employees may also unionize in the future. If at any time, a significant amount of our employees unionized, it could limit the flexibility of the workforce and could result in demands that might increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. Each of our different employee groups could unionize at any time and would require separate collective bargaining agreements. If any group of our employees were to unionize and we were unable to agree on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or we were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by organized labor groups protesting our non-union status. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.15Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance as well as negative reputational impacts relating to health and safety matters.Our workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations.  In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our contracts or not award us future business.Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.If we are unable to comply with applicable immigration laws, our ability to successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted.We rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all undocumented immigrants who work for us. Our failure to identify undocumented immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition. Environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, climate change and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, these laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities. Our aggregate quarry leases in Utah and Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarries, we could be held responsible for any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarries. Any such costs and liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity. Because all of our construction projects are performed outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Harvey caused damage and disruption that resulted in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days or weeks.  Future evacuations in Texas due to hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coastal areas can delay our performance of work on contracts for several days or weeks or longer. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. 16Extreme heat can prevent us from performing certain types of operations. During the late fall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in Nevada and Utah may also be curtailed because of snow and other work-limiting weather. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed. We rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, which are subject to disruption, failure or security breaches. We rely on information technology (“IT”) systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential information on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.We are dependent on a small number of significant customers in our residential construction business.Our customers are leading residential homebuilders. Several of these customers individually account for a significant portion of our residential construction business's sales in a normal year. In our residential construction business, D.R. Horton Inc., Pulte Homes Inc., HISTORYMAKER Homes, and Lennar, including their respective affiliates, accounted for approximately 72% and 67% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, homebuilders are reliant upon growth in the housing market and the continued ability to purchase and develop land, which ultimately impact customers’ demand for our residential construction services. The loss of any one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Financing and Liquidity Our use of over time recognition (formally known as percentage-of-completion method) accounting related to our heavy civil construction projects could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported revenue and profits.As is more fully discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies,” we recognize heavy civil contract revenue over time. This method is used because management considers the cost-to-cost measure of progress to be the best measure of progress on these contracts.Under this method, estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the cost-to-cost measure of progress for the period (based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and the performance of subcontractors. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These adjustments could result in both increases and decreases in profit margins or losses. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our business.  To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material. We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our Backlog.Backlog as of December 31, 2018 totaled $851 million in our heavy civil construction segment. Backlog develops as a result of new awards, which represent the potential revenue value realizable pursuant to new project commitments received by us during a given period.17Backlog is measured and defined differently by companies within our industry. We refer to “Backlog” as the unearned revenue we expect to earn in future periods on our executed heavy civil construction contracts.  As the construction on our projects progresses, we increase or decrease Backlog to take into account signed contracts, revenue earned during the period and our estimates of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changed conditions, change orders and other variations from previously anticipated contract revenues, including completion penalties and incentives. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our Backlog will be realized, or if realized, will result in earnings. Most contracts may be terminated by our customers on short notice. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to recover the total revenue reflected in our Backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, canceled projects may also result in additional unrecoverable costs due to the resulting under-utilization of our assets or labor force. Backlog may not be realized or may not result in revenues or profits. Given these factors, our Backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our Backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year. Inability to realize revenue from our Backlog could have an adverse effect on our business.We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us and makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions.We have pledged the proceeds and other rights under our heavy civil construction contracts to our bond surety, and we have pledged substantially all of our other assets as collateral in connection with our Oaktree Facility. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, under our Oaktree Facility, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur additional debt from other sources (subject to certain limited exceptions). In April 2017, we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized shares of common stock from 28 million shares to 38 million shares. If future financing is obtained by the issuance of additional shares of common stock, our stockholders may suffer dilution. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.We are subject to certain covenants under our Oaktree Facility that could limit our flexibility in managing our business and our ability to raise capital.Our Oaktree Facility restricts us from engaging in certain activities, including our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability (subject to certain exceptions) to:•create, incur, assume or permit to exist liens or encumbrances;•incur additional indebtedness;•dispose of a material portion of assets or merge or consolidate with a third party;•sell assets;•make loans;•enter into acquisitions;•incur capital expenditures;•make investments; and•pay dividends.18Additionally, our Oaktree Facility also requires that we maintain certain financial covenants and prepay outstanding loans (in certain cases with a prepayment premium) with proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity, transfers, events of loss and extraordinary receipts. These requirements could limit our cash flow or impair our ability to conduct business and pursue business strategies. Further, our level of indebtedness could have important other consequences to our business, including the following:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt service;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; •limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt; or•requiring that we pledge substantial collateral, which may limit flexibility in operating our business and restrict our ability to sell assets.          These restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financings or engage in other business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.                 Any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our Oaktree Facility may result in an event of default that could allow the creditors to accelerate maturities under the Oaktree Facility, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt or bonding agreements. Our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our debt instruments that could be accelerated upon an event of default.Our Oaktree Facility bears interest at an annual rate of the one-, two-, three- or six-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 8.75%, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.The financial industry is currently transitioning away from LIBOR as a benchmark for the interbank lending market.  While an orderly transition to a new benchmark is expected, a universal approach has not been adopted.  It is uncertain as to the nature of any replacement rate and whether it will gain widespread market acceptance.  Because our Oaktree Facility bears interest calculated by reference to LIBOR, we may be impacted by this transition, including by:•the effect of uncertainty regarding the interest rate calculation before replacement benchmark is published regularly and gains widespread market acceptance;•the risk that differences in the administration or determination methodology of the replacement benchmark may affect the amount of interest payments; or•the potential need to amend our credit facility to specify a replacement reference rate via a consent solicitation, and whether necessary consent may be obtained at an acceptable cost or at all.Our strategy of growing through strategic acquisitions may not be successful.We may pursue growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into new markets. We have completed several acquisitions and plan to consider strategic acquisitions in the future. We may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable companies or assets or reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms. Moreover, an acquisition involves certain risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of operations, systems, policies and procedures;•enhancements in our controls and procedures including those necessary for a public company may make it more difficult to integrate operations and systems;•failure to implement proper overall business controls, including those required to support our growth, resulting in inconsistent operating and financial practices at companies we acquire or have acquired;•termination of relationships with the key personnel and customers of an acquired company;•additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;•the incurrence of environmental and other liabilities, including liabilities arising from the operation of an acquired business or asset prior to our acquisition for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;•disruption of or receipt of insufficient management attention to our ongoing business; and•inability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that we anticipate.19To service our indebtedness and to fund working capital, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that are beyond our control, including the fact that adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.We do not have a revolving credit facility or letter of credit facility so our ability to meet our liquidity requirements, including to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund working capital requirements, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to our operational performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may be unable to expand our credit capacity, which could adversely affect our operations and business. Earnings from our operations and our working capital requirements can vary from period to period based primarily on the mix of our projects underway and the percentage of project work completed during the period. Capital expenditures may also vary significantly from period to period. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or asset sales or that we can obtain future borrowing capacity in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer.In the event these resources do not satisfy our liquidity needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. The domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets may experience significant volatility, disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability. Should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain such additional funds. If internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms also could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we experience operational difficulties, we may need to increase our available borrowing capacity or seek amendments to the terms of our Oaktree Facility. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any additional capacity or amendment to our Oaktree Facility or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, in which case, our costs of borrowing could rise and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We must manage our liquidity carefully to fund our working capital. The need for working capital for our business varies due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors: •receivables and contract retentions;•costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings;•billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings;•the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and•the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors.We may have limited cash on hand and the timing of payments on our contract receivables is difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed or the amount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materially and adversely affected. 20We may be required to write down all or part of our goodwill and intangibles. We had $85 million of goodwill and $42 million of intangibles recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is separable, that is, it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged (whether there is intent to do so).  A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill or intangible assets have been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill and periodic assessments of intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired. On an interim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing. Write downs of goodwill and intangible assets may be substantial. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets in future periods, our net earnings and equity could be materially adversely affected"
6,STRL,STERLING CONSTRUCTION CO INC,2018-03-06,"Risk Factors
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and cash flows. These could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below.Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of our future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Risks Relating to Our Business If we do not accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs related to a heavy civil project when we bid on or negotiate a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract. The majority of our revenues and backlog are derived from fixed unit price contracts and from lump sum contracts. Fixed unit price contracts require us to provide materials and services at a fixed unit price based on agreed quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require the contract work to be completed for a single price irrespective of our actual costs incurred. Given that our revenues per contract are fixed, our ability to contract profitability is dependent upon our ability to avoid cost overruns by accurately estimating our costs and then successfully controlling our actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. As a result, these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position. The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original estimates due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: •onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;•failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;•delays caused by weather conditions;•contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change order or contract price adjustments;•changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;•higher than anticipated costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment;•inability to predict the costs of accessing and producing aggregates and purchasing oil required for asphalt paving projects;•availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;•rapidly increasing labor costs;•failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customers to perform their obligations;•fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners, customers or our own personnel;•mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;•citations issued by any governmental authority, including OSHA;•difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;•changes in applicable laws and regulations;•delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during execution of a project; and13•claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part.Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. Public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position. Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials (including petroleum-based products) could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all. We rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our projects. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the necessary subcontractors committed for the anticipated scope of the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid, except in some instances for trucking arrangements. Therefore, to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a subcontractor is unable to deliver its services according to the negotiated terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide most of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, pipe, oil and fuel) for our contracts, except in Utah and Nevada where we source and produce some of the aggregates we use from quarries in which we have mining rights. We do not own or operate any quarries in Texas, Arizona, California, or Hawaii. We normally do not bid on contracts unless we have commitments from suppliers for the materials required to complete the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid, except for some construction projects in Utah and Nevada where we use aggregates from quarries in which we have mining rights. Thus, to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier is unable to deliver materials according to the negotiated terms of a supply agreement for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the materials from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract. Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products are utilized to operate the plants and equipment on which we rely to perform our construction contracts. In addition, our asphalt plants and suppliers use oil in combination with aggregates to produce asphalt used in our road and highway construction projects. Decreased supplies of such products relative to demand, unavailability of petroleum supplies due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum based products and other factors can increase the cost of such products. Future increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and the costs of such products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract.We may not accurately assess the quality, and we may not accurately estimate the quantity, availability and cost, of aggregates we need to complete a project, particularly for projects in rural areas. Particularly for projects in rural areas, we typically estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for aggregates (such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag and recycled concrete) from sources that we have not previously used to supply aggregates, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regarding aggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delays and other inefficiencies. As a result, our failure to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline. A significant portion of our contracts is serviced with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts. The equipment that we own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to continue to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third-party repair services, which could increase our costs. In addition, the market value of our equipment may unexpectedly decline at a faster rate than anticipated.14We are dependent on a limited number of heavy civil construction customers. Due to the size and nature of our heavy civil construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. Our significant heavy civil customers, those greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues, accounted for approximately 25% of our revenue in 2017, 37% of our revenue in 2016 and 29% of our revenue in 2015. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  See Note 16--Concentration of Risk and Enterprise Wide Disclosures.The heavy civil construction industry is highly competitive, with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded. In the past, a majority of the contracts on which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other factors, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer. For our design-build, CM/GC and other alternative methods of delivering projects, reputation, marketing efforts, quality of design and minimizing public inconvenience are also significant factors considered in awarding contracts, in addition to cost. Within our markets, we compete with many international, national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors have achieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and several of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, a number of international and national companies in our industry that are larger than we are and that currently do not have a significant presence in our markets, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our markets and compete with us for contracts. In addition, if the use of design-build, CM/GC and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced.Our heavy construction business relies on highly competitive and highly regulated government contracts.Government funding for public works projects is limited, thus creating a highly competitive environment for the limited number of public projects available. In addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of regulatory requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result, any violations of these regulations could bring about litigation, including the possibility of qui tam (“Whistleblower”) litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, and could cause termination of other existing government contracts and result in the loss of future government contracts. Due to the significant competition in the marketplace and the level of regulations on government contracts, we could suffer reductions in new projects and see lower revenues and profit margins on those projects, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.Our heavy civil construction business depends on our ability to qualify as an eligible bidder under government contract criteria and to compete successfully against other qualified bidders in order to obtain government contracts within our heavy civil business.The U.S. government and various state and local government agencies conduct rigorous competitive processes for awarding many contracts. Some contracts include multiple award task order contracts in which several contractors are selected as eligible bidders for future work. We will face strong competition and pricing pressures for any additional contract awards from the U.S. government and other government agencies, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under various multiple award task order contract criteria. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under government contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain government contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain government contracts and to win those contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.15Our heavy civil construction business is susceptible to economic downturns and reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects. Our business is highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects. For example, state spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us since we are reliant upon contracts with state transportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues. Refer to our “Business - Our Markets and Customers” section above for a more detailed discussion of our markets.Most of our significant heavy civil contracts can be canceled on short notice. Our governmental contracts generally have clauses that permit the government to cancel the contract unilaterally and at any time as long as the government pays for the work already completed. A cancellation of an unfinished contract could cause our equipment and work crews to be idle for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The homebuilding industry is cyclical and susceptible to downward changes in general economic or other business conditions which could affect our residential concrete projects, including foundations for single-family and multi-family homes.           The residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts, which could adversely affect the number of concrete projects we construct or reduce the prices we can charge for these projects, either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.Our participation in heavy civil construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends upon managing the risks discussed in the various risks described in these “Risk Factors
” and on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduce our profit on a project. In connection with acquisitions, certain counterparties to joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements. Any termination of a joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may not be able to recover on claims against project owners or subcontractors for payment or performance.We occasionally present claims or change orders to our clients and subcontractors for additional costs exceeding a contract price or for costs not included in the original contract price. Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract without adding new provisions. They generally include changes in specifications or design, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and periods for completion of work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price (or amounts not included in the original contract price) that we seek to collect for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations or other causes of unanticipated additional costs, such as costs caused by negative weather conditions. These costs may or may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. In some instances, these claims can be 16the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly document and negotiate a recovery for change orders and claims could have a negative impact on our cash flows and overall ability to recover change orders and claims which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our heavy civil contracts. In most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to timely complete a project could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract.The design-build project delivery method subjects us to the risk of design errors and omissions. In the event of a design error or omission causing damages with respect to one of our design-build projects, we could be liable. Although by contract we pass design responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors and omissions insurance that they and we purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our construction projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Performance problems on existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers.An inability to obtain bonding or post letters of credit could limit the aggregate dollar amount of heavy civil contracts that we are able to pursue. As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide surety bonds or letters of credit to our customers to secure our performance under construction contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds or letters of credit primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, available credit facilities, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety and letter of credit market. Surety companies and banks consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets and the banking markets generally may result in bonding or letters of credit becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding or letters of credit would limit the amount that we can bid on new contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.Timing of the award and performance of new heavy civil contracts may fluctuate. It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as our contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial. The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit. In addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from our contracts can be delayed by a number of factors, including: adverse weather conditions, such as prolonged or intense periods of rain, snow, storms or flooding, delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and services from subcontractors, and changes in the scope of work to be performed. Such delays, if they occur, could have adverse effects on our operating results for current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed.We may be unable to attract and retain project managers, skilled labor and other key personnel. Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes for each of our subsidiaries management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers. The loss of the services of any of our subsidiaries' management-level personnel could 17have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. If competition for these employees is intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted.We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs.In Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada a substantial number of our equipment operators and laborers are unionized. Additional groups of our employees may also unionize in the future. If at any time, a majority of our employees unionized, it could limit the flexibility of the workforce and could result in demands that might increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability. Each of our different employee groups could unionize at any time and would require separate collective bargaining agreements. If any group of our employees were to unionize and we were unable to agree on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or we were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction, we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages. In addition, we may be subject to disruptions by organized labor groups protesting our non-union status. Any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance.Our workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations.Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.If we are unable to comply with applicable immigration laws, our ability to successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted.We rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all undocumented immigrants who work for us. Our failure to identify undocumented immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition. Environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, climate change and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, these laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities. 18Our aggregate quarry leases in Utah and Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarries, we could be held responsible for any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarries. Any such costs and liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our construction activity. Because all of our construction projects are performed outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, evacuations in Texas due to hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coastal areas can result in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days or weeks. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Extreme heat can prevent us from performing certain types of operations. During the late fall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in Nevada and Utah may also be curtailed because of snow and other work-limiting weather. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed.  Adverse weather conditions have a less severe impact on our residential construction projects, but can cause short-term variations in financial results.Force majeure events, such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters, have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy and the markets in which we operate. Force majeure events, such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters, have contributed to economic instability in the United States in the past and further acts of terrorism, violence, war, or natural disasters could affect the markets in which we operate, our business and our expectations. Armed hostilities may increase, or terrorist attacks, or responses from the United States, may lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the United States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability in the United States. These force majeure events may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, our production capability and our ability to complete contracts in a timely manner.We rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, which are subject to disruption, failure or security breaches. We rely on information technology (“IT”) systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential information on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.We are dependent on a small number of significant customers in our residential construction business.Our customers are leading residential homebuilders. Several of these customers individually account for a significant portion of our residential construction busines's sales in a normal year. For the year ended December 31, 2017 in our residential construction business, D.R. Horton, Pulte Homes and HISTORYMAKER Homes, including their respective affiliates, accounted for more than 61% of our residential construction revenues. In addition, homebuilders are reliant upon growth in the housing market and the continued ability to purchase and develop land, which ultimately impact customers’ demand for our residential construction services. The loss of any one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Financing and Liquidity Our use of percentage-of-completion accounting related to our heavy civil construction projects could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported revenue and profits. As is more fully discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies,” we recognize heavy civil contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion 19method. This method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts.Under this method, estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the contract for the period (based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Contract revenue is reviewed and revised on a continuous basis as the work progresses and as change orders are initiated or approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in the accounting period when these estimates are revised. Penalties or potential charges are recorded when known or finalized, which generally is during the latter stages of the contract. In addition, we record adjustments to estimated costs of contracts when we believe the change in the estimate is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These adjustments could result in both increases and decreases in profit margins or losses. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our business.  To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material. We may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our Backlog.Backlog as of December 31, 2017 totaled $744 million in our heavy civil construction segment. Backlog develops as a result of new awards, which represent the potential revenue value realizable pursuant to new project commitments received by us during a given period.Backlog is measured and defined differently by companies within our industry. We refer to “Backlog” as the unearned revenue we expect to earn in future periods on our executed heavy civil construction contracts.  As the construction on our projects progresses, we increase or decrease Backlog to take into account signed contracts, revenue earned during the period and our estimates of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changed conditions, change orders and other variations from previously anticipated contract revenues, including completion penalties and incentives. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our Backlog will be realized, or if realized, will result in earnings. Most contracts may be terminated by our customers on short notice. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to recover the total revenue reflected in our Backlog. In addition to being unable to recover certain direct costs, canceled projects may also result in additional unrecoverable costs due to the resulting under-utilization of our assets or labor force. Backlog may not be realized or may not result in revenues or profits. Given these factors, our Backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our Backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year. Inability to realize revenue from our Backlog could have an adverse effect on our business.We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us and makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions.We have pledged the proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety, and we have pledged substantially all of our other assets as collateral in connection with our secured credit facility. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, under our Oaktree Facility, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur additional debt from other sources (subject to certain limited exceptions). In April 2017, in connection with the Tealstone acquisition, we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized shares of common stock from 28 million shares to 38 million shares and we issued 1,882,058 shares of our common stock as consideration paid to the sellers. If future financing is obtained by the issuance of additional shares of common stock, our stockholders may suffer dilution. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.Our strategy of growing through strategic acquisitions may not be successful.We may pursue growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that will enable us to broaden the types of projects we execute and also expand into new markets. We have completed several acquisitions and plan to consider strategic acquisitions in 20the future. We may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable companies or assets or reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms. Moreover, an acquisition involves certain risks, including:•difficulties in the integration of operations, systems, policies and procedures;•enhancements in our controls and procedures including those necessary for a public company may make it more difficult                to integrate operations and systems;•failure to implement proper overall business controls, including those required to support our growth, resulting in              inconsistent operating and financial practices at companies we acquire or have acquired;•termination of relationships with the key personnel and customers of an acquired company;•additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management,                    financial reporting and internal controls;•the incurrence of environmental and other liabilities, including liabilities arising from the operation of an acquired business                or asset prior to our acquisition for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;•disruption of or receipt of insufficient management attention to our ongoing business; and•inability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits that we anticipate.We are subject to certain covenants under our Oaktree Facility that could limit our flexibility in managing our business.Our Oaktree Facility restricts us from engaging in certain activities, including our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability (subject to certain exceptions) to:•create, incur, assume or permit to exist liens or encumbrances;•incur additional indebtedness;•dispose of a material portion of assets or merge or consolidate with a third party;•sell assets;•make loans;•enter into acquisitions;•incur capital expenditures;•make investments; and•pay dividends.Additionally, our Oaktree Facility also requires that we maintain certain financial covenants and prepay the loans (in certain cases with a prepayment premium) with proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity, transfers, events of loss and extraordinary receipts. These requirements could limit our cash flow or impair our ability to conduct business. Further, our level of indebtedness could have important other consequences to our business, including the following:•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt service;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; or•limit our ability to borrow additional funds.                These restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financings or engage in other business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.                 Any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our Oaktree Facility may result in an event of default that could allow the creditors to accelerate maturities under the Oaktree Facility, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt or bonding agreements. Our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our debt instruments that could be accelerated upon an event of default.Our credit facility bears interest at an annual rate of the one-, two-, three- or six-month London interbank rate, or LIBOR, plus 8.75%, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition. 21To service our indebtedness and to fund working capital, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that are beyond our control, including the fact that adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.We do not have a revolving credit facility or letter of credit facility so our ability to meet our liquidity requirements, including to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund working capital requirements, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to our operational performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may be unable to expand our credit capacity, which could adversely affect our operations and business. Earnings from our operations and our working capital requirements can vary from period to period based primarily on the mix of our projects underway and the percentage of project work completed during the period. Capital expenditures may also vary significantly from period to period. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or asset sales or that we can obtain future borrowing capacity in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer.In the event these resources do not satisfy our liquidity needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. The domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets may experience significant volatility, disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability. Should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain such additional funds. If internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms also could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we experience operational difficulties, we may need to increase our available borrowing capacity or seek amendments to the terms of our Oaktree Facility. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any additional capacity or amendment to our Oaktree Facility or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, in which case, our costs of borrowing could rise and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We must manage our liquidity carefully to fund our working capital. The need for working capital for our business varies due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors: •receivables and contract retentions;•costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings;•billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings;•the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and•the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors.We may have limited cash on hand and the timing of payments on our contract receivables is difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed or the amount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materially and adversely affected. We may be required to write down all or part of our goodwill and intangibles. We had $85.2 million of goodwill  and  $44.8 million of intangibles recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if it arises from contractual or other legal rights or if it is separable, that is, it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged (whether there is intent to do so).  A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill or intangible assets have been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill and periodic assessments of intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired. On an interim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing. Write downs of goodwill and intangible assets may be 22substantial. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets in future periods, our net earnings and equity could be materially adversely affected"
13,STRL,STERLING CONSTRUCTION CO INC,2017-03-09,"Risk Factors
. The risks describedbelow are those we believe to be the material risks we face. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adverselyaffect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Relating to OurBusiness.  Ifwe are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when we bid on or negotiate a contract that is ultimatelyawarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract. The majority of ourrevenues and backlog are derived from fixed unit price contracts and from lump sum contracts. Fixed unit price contracts requireus to provide materials and services at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs.Lump sum contracts require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price irrespective of our actual per unit costs.We realize a profit on our contracts only if we accurately estimate our costs and then successfully control actual costs and avoidcost overruns, and our revenues exceed actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not executethe contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur losses or cause the contract not to be as profitableas we expected. The final results under these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financialposition. The costs incurredand gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety offactors, including, but not limited to: ·onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;·failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly thequantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;·delays caused by weather conditions;·contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders;·changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregatesand other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for ourequipment;·inability to predict the costs of accessing and producing aggregates and purchasing oil requiredfor asphalt paving projects;·availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;·failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customersto perform their obligations;·fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers,joint venture partners, customers or our own personnel;·mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;·citations issued by any governmental authority, including OSHA;·difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;·changes in applicable laws and regulations;·delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during production; and·claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, constructionor use and operation of a project of which our work is part. Many of our contractswith public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, evenin cases where the customer is partly at fault. Our experience has often been that public sector customers have been willing tonegotiate equitable adjustments in the contract compensation or completion time provisions if unexpected circumstances arise. However,public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks andadversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position. We may be unable to growour revenues and increase our profitability. Our revenue has fluctuatedin recent years, in part through market conditions and, in 2007, 2009 and 2011, acquisitions that expanded our geographical footprint.We may be unable to grow our revenues for a variety of reasons, including decreased government funding for infrastructure projects,limits on additional growth in our current markets, reduced spending by our customers, an increased number of competitors, lesssuccess in competitive bidding for contracts, limitations on access to necessary working capital and investment capital to sustaingrowth, limitations on access to bonding to support increased contracts and operations, inability to hire and retain essentialpersonnel and to acquire equipment to support growth, and inability to identify acquisition candidates and successfully acquireand integrate them into our business. A substantial decline in our revenue could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations if we are unable to also reduce our operating expenses. See “Recent Developments ―Financial Results for 2016, Operational Issues and Outlook for 2017 Financial Results” above for further discussion of theimpact on our financial results. 11  Economic downturns or reductionsin government funding of infrastructure projects could reduce our revenues and profits and have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations. Our business is highlydependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on theoverall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects fundedby governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerousreasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects, including federalfunding. The most recent recession caused a nationwide decline in home sales and an increase in foreclosures, which correspondinglyresulted in decreases in property taxes and some other local taxes, which are among the sources of funding for municipal road,bridge and water infrastructure construction. State spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreasesor delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us. We are reliant upon contractswith state transportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues. Refer to our “Business−OurMarkets and Customers” section above for a more detailed discussion of our markets and their funding sources. We operate in Texas, Utah,Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, California, Hawaii and to a lesser extent in other states, and adverse changes to the economy and businessenvironment in those states have had an adverse effect on, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations, which couldlead to lower revenues and reduced profitability. Because of this concentrationin specific geographic locations, we are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditionsin these regions, including natural or other disasters. The stagnant or depressed economy, to varying degrees, in Texas, Utah,Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, California and Hawaii have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our businessand results of operations. The cancellation of significantcontracts or our disqualification from bidding for new contracts could reduce our revenues and profits and have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations. Contracts that weenter into with governmental entities can usually be canceled at any time by them with payment only for the work already completed.In addition, we could be prohibited from bidding on certain governmental contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications requiredby those entities. A cancellation of an unfinished contract or our debarment from the bidding process could cause our equipmentand work crews to be idled for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our industry is highly competitive,with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contractsawarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded. In the past, a majorityof the contracts on which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowestbidder, but sometimes recognizing other factors, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer. Forour design-build, CM/GC and other alternative methods of delivering projects, reputation, marketing efforts, quality of designand minimizing public inconvenience are also significant factors considered in awarding contracts, in addition to cost. Withinour markets, we compete with many international, national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors haveachieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and some may have greater financial and otherresources than we do. In addition, there are a number of international and national companies in our industry that are larger thanwe are and that, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our markets and compete with us for contracts. In some markets whereresidential and commercial projects have significantly diminished, the bidding environment in our markets has been much more competitiveas construction companies that lack available work in those markets have begun bidding on projects in our markets, sometimes atbid levels below our break-even pricing. In addition, traditional competitors on larger transportation and water infrastructureprojects also appear to have been bidding at less than normal margins, and in some cases at below our break-even pricing, in orderto replenish their backlogs. As a result, we may need to accept lower contract margins in order to compete against competitorsthat have the ability to accept awards at lower prices or have a pre-existing relationship with a customer. 12  In addition, if theuse of design-build, CM/GC and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to furtherdevelop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage,which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we areunable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced. Our dependence on subcontractorsand suppliers of materials (including petroleum-based products) could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contractson a timely basis or at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow. We rely on third-partysubcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the necessarysubcontractors committed for the anticipated scope of the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid, except in someinstances for trucking arrangements. Therefore, to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors, our ability to bid for contractsmay be impaired. In addition, if a subcontractor is unable to deliver its services according to the negotiated terms for any reason,including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services from anothersource at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, ona contract. We also rely on third-partysuppliers to provide most of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, pipe, oil and fuel) for ourcontracts, except in Utah and Nevada where we source and produce some of the aggregates we use from quarries in which we have miningrights. We do not own or operate any quarries in Texas, Arizona, California, or Hawaii. We normally do not bid on contracts unlesswe have commitments from suppliers for the materials and subcontractors for certain of the services required to complete the contractand at prices that we have included in our bid, except for some construction projects in Utah and Nevada where we use aggregatesfrom quarries in which we have mining rights. Thus, to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliers for materialsand subcontractors for certain of the services, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier orsubcontractor is unable to deliver materials or services according to the negotiated terms of a supply/services agreement for anyreason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the materials/servicesfrom another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or resultin a loss, on a contract. Diesel fuel and otherpetroleum-based products are utilized to operate the plants and equipment on which we rely to perform our construction contracts.In addition, our asphalt plants and suppliers use oil in combination with aggregates to produce asphalt used in our road and highwayconstruction projects. Decreased supplies of such products relative to demand, unavailability of petroleum supplies due to refineryturnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum based products and other factors can increase the cost of such products. Futureincreases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submittedfor a contract and the costs of such products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result ina lower profit, or a loss, on a contract. We may not accurately assessthe quality, and we may not accurately estimate the quantity, availability and cost, of aggregates we plan to produce, particularlyfor projects in rural areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Particularly for projectsin rural areas, we typically estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for anticipated aggregate sources that we havenot previously used to produce aggregates, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimatesregarding aggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potentialdelays and other inefficiencies. As a result, our failure to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost ofaggregates could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to attractand retain key personnel and skilled labor, or if we encounter labor difficulties, our ability to bid for and successfully completecontracts may be negatively impacted. Our ability to attractand retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably completeour work. This includes members of our management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators andlaborers. The loss of the services of any of our management could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success willalso depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. If competition for these employeesis intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeedin retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may beharmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted. 13  We rely heavily onimmigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws.However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all undocumented immigrants who workfor us. Our failure to identify undocumented immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed uponus, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition. In Nevada, Arizona,California and Hawaii, a substantial number of our equipment operators and laborers are unionized. Any work stoppage or other labordispute involving our unionized workforce, or inability to renew contracts with the unions, could have a material adverse effecton our operations and operating results. Our contracts may requireus to perform extra or change order work, which can result in claim disputes and adversely affect our working capital, profitsand cash flows. Our contracts oftenrequire us to perform extra or change order work as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance onthe scope or price of the extra work to be performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyondthe scope of the work included in the original project plans and specifications or, if the customer agrees that the work performedqualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. These disputes may not be settled toour satisfaction. Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work fora lengthy period of time until the change order is approved by the customer and we are paid by the customer. To the extent thatactual recoveries with respect to change orders or amounts subject to contract disputes or claims are less than the estimates usedin our financial statements, the amount of any shortfall will reduce our future revenues and profits, and this could have a materialadverse effect on our reported working capital and results of operations. In addition, any delay caused by the extra work may adverselyimpact the timely scheduling of other project work and our ability to meet specified contract milestone dates. Our failure to meet scheduleor performance requirements of our contracts could adversely affect us. In most cases, ourcontracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to meet any such schedule could result in additional costs,penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract. Performanceproblems on existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipatedby us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers. The design-build projectdelivery method subjects us to the risk of design errors and omissions. In the event of adesign error or omission causing damages with respect to one of our design-build projects, we could be liable. Although we passdesign responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, inthe event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance,and the errors and omissions insurance that they and we purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilitiesresulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our construction projects may have a material adverse effect on our financialposition, results of operations and cash flows. Adverse weather conditionsmay cause delays, which could slow completion of our contracts and negatively affect our revenues and cash flow. Because all of ourconstruction projects are built outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to unpredictable weather conditions, which could becomemore frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, evacuations in Texas due to hurricanes along the U.S. Gulfof Mexico coastal areas can result in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days. Lengthy periodsof wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment,resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Extreme heat can prevent us from performing certain types of operations.During the late fall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in Nevada and Utah may also becurtailed because of snow and other work-limiting weather. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, itis generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitabilityof affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contractprofitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed. 14  Timing of the award andperformance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. It is generally verydifficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as these contracts frequently involve a lengthyand complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangementsand governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarterand year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial. The uncertainty ofthe timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contractneeds. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are currently required, inanticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contractaward is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit. In addition, the timingof the revenues, earnings and cash flows from our contracts can be delayed by a number of factors, including adverse weather conditions,such as prolonged or intense periods of rain, snow, storms or flooding; delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliersand services from subcontractors; and changes in the scope of work to be performed. Such delays, if they occur, could have adverseeffects on our operating results for current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed. Our participation in constructionjoint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners. As part of our business,we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects withother companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends upon managing the risks discussed in thevarious risks described in these “Risk Factors
” and on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractualobligations. We and our joint venturepartners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venturepartner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, includingliabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay morethan our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequatelyaddress our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability tous, harm to our reputation and reduction to our profit on a project. In connection withacquisitions, certain counterparties to joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may notdesire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements.Any termination of a joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on a limitednumber of customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Due to the size andnature of our construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portionof our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Similarly, our backlogfrequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage ofbacklog at a certain point in time. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect onour business or results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer could materiallyadversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may incur higher coststo lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline. A significant portionof our contracts is built with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we areunable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortagesin the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing ourcontracts. The equipment thatwe own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to continueto maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third-party repair services, which could increase our costs.In addition, the market value of our equipment may unexpectedly decline at a faster rate than anticipated. 15  An inability to obtain bondingcould limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue. As is customary inthe construction business, we are required to provide surety bonds to our customers to secure our performance under constructioncontracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, managementexpertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companies considersuch factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time.Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtainin the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit theamount that we can bid on new contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects. Our operations are subjectto hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which maynot be covered by insurance. Our workers are subjectto the usual hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. Operatinghazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmentaldamage. We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance andother types of insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequateto cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations. Insurance liabilitiesare difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liabilityin proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were toexperience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims ratherthan to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity ofaccidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our operating resultsand financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Environmental and otherregulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations aresubject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances,climate change and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contaminationcreated not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on propertiesthat we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health,which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Immigration laws require us to take certain stepsintended to confirm the legal status of our immigrant labor force, but we may nonetheless unknowingly employ undocumented immigrants.Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party propertydamage or personal injury claims. In addition, these laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliancestandards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatoryrequirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respectto products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, aswell as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, amongother things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modificationof permits applicable to our activities. Our aggregate quarryleases in Utah and Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarries, we could be held responsiblefor any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarries. Any such costs and liabilitiescould be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 16  Force majeure events, suchas terrorist attacks or natural disasters, have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy and the marketsin which we operate. Force majeure events,such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters, have contributed to economic instability in the United States in the past and furtheracts of terrorism, violence, war, or natural disasters could affect the markets in which we operate, our business and our expectations.Armed hostilities may increase, or terrorist attacks, or responses from the United States, may lead to further acts of terrorismand civil disturbances in the United States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability in the United States.These force majeure events may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, ourproduction capability and our ability to complete contracts in a timely manner. We rely on information technologysystems to conduct our business, and disruption, failure or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our businessand results of operations. We rely on informationtechnology (“IT”) systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted securitymeasures and technology to securely maintain confidential information maintained on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardwareand software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused bycircumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures,computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform asanticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transactionerrors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significantdisruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition. Risks Related to OurFinancial Results and Financing Plans. Actual results could differfrom the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements. To prepare financialstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), management isrequired to make estimates and assumptions, as of the date of the financial statements, which affect the reported values of assetsand liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimatesby our management include: contract costs and profits; application of percentage-of-completion accounting and revenue recognitionof contract change order claims; provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors,suppliers and others; impairment of long-term assets; valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with businesscombinations; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves; and stock-based compensation. Ouractual results could differ from, and could require adjustments to, those estimates. In particular, asis more fully discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Critical Accounting Policies,” we recognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method,estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the contract for the period (based on theratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Estimated contractlosses are recognized in full when determined. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on a continuousbasis as the work progresses and as change orders are initiated or approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage of completionare reflected in contract revenue in the accounting period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustmentsresult in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a chargeagainst current earnings, which could be material. We may need to raise additionalcapital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorableterms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives. Our ability to obtainadditional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as conditionsin our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on termssatisfactory to us. We have pledged the proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety, and we havepledged substantially all of our other assets as collateral in connection with our equipment-based credit facility. As a result,we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral.In addition, under our equipment-based credit facility, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur any amount of additionaldebt from other sources (subject to certain exceptions). If future financing is obtained by the issuance of additional shares ofcommon stock, our stockholders may suffer dilution. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms,we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitivechallenges. 17  Weare subject to certain covenants under our equipment-based credit facility that could limit our flexibility in managing our business. We have an equipment-basedcredit facility that restricts us from engaging in certain activities, including our ability (subject to certain exceptions) to: ·incur liens or encumbrances;·incur further indebtedness;·dispose of a material portion of assets or merge with a third party;·make acquisitions; and·make investments in securities. Our credit facilitybears interest at an initial annual rate of 12%, which is subject to (i) a decrease of up to two percentage points based on theCompany's fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the most recently ended four quarters beginning with the four quarterly periodended June 30, 2016; and (ii) an increase of up to two percentage points beginning December 31, 2015 based on the fixed chargecoverage ratio at the end of the following four quarters. To the extent that the fixed charge ratio calculation described aboveresults in an interest rate increase, the increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business operations,financial performance and financial condition. Weare subject to a limitation on the amount that we can borrow under our equipment-based credit facility based on the value of ourcollateralized equipment. Our equipment-basedcredit facility is secured by all of the Company’s personal property except accounts receivable, including all of its constructionequipment, which forms the basis of our borrowing capacity under our credit facility. This facility is also secured by one-halfof the equipment of the Company’s 50%-owned affiliates. The sum of the amount borrowed may not exceed the lesser of $40 millionor 65% of the appraised value of the collateral pledged for the facility. At December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $24.4million of borrowing base which was the result of calculating 65% of the appraised value of the Company’s collateral. Basedon market conditions, which includes the amount of construction work available and the demand for construction equipment, the appraisedvalue of our equipment may be subject to fluctuating values. If these market conditions are unfavorable, we may see a decline inour borrowing availability that could result in liquidity constraints, which could materially and adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition. We must manage our liquidity carefullyto fund our working capital. The need for workingcapital for our business varies due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors: ·contract receivables and contract retentions;·costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings;·billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings;·the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and·the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors. We have limited cashon hand and the timing of payments on our contract receivables is difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivablesis delayed or the amount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materiallyand adversely affected. If we were required to writedown all or part of our goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially and adversely affected. We had $54.8 millionof goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fairvalue of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition.A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investorscould significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amountof net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluatewhether our goodwill has been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill to determine if it has become impaired. On aninterim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may triggerimpairment testing. Write downs of goodwill may be substantial. If we were required to write down all or a significant part ofour goodwill in future periods our net earnings and equity could be materially and adversely affected. 18  "
7,STRL,STERLING CONSTRUCTION CO INC,2016-03-14,"Risk Factors
.The risks described below are those webelieve to be the material risks we face. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect ourbusiness, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Relating to Our Business. If we are unable to accuratelyestimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when we bid on or negotiate a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we mayachieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.The majority of our revenues and backlogare derived from fixed unit price contracts. Some of our revenues are derived from lump sum contracts. Fixed unit price contractsrequire us to provide materials and services at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual perunit costs. Lump sum contracts require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price irrespective of our actualper unit costs. We realize a profit on our contracts only if we accurately estimate our costs and then successfully control actualcosts and avoid cost overruns, and our revenues exceed actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or ifwe do not execute the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur losses or cause the contractnot to be as profitable as we expected. The final results under these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow,earnings and financial position.The costs incurred and gross profit realizedon our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but notlimited to:·onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;·failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly thequantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;·delays caused by weather conditions;·contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders;·changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregatesand other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for ourequipment;·inability to predict the costs of accessing and producing aggregates and purchasing oil requiredfor asphalt paving projects;·availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;·failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customersto perform their obligations;·fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers,joint venture partners, customers or our own personnel;·mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;·citations issued by any governmental authority, including OSHA;·difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;·changes in applicable laws and regulations;·delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during production; and·claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, constructionor use and operation of a project of which our work is part.Many of our contracts with public sectorcustomers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases wherethe customer is partly at fault. Our experience has often been that public sector customers have been willing to negotiate equitableadjustments in the contract compensation or completion time provisions if unexpected circumstances arise. However, public sectorcustomers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affectour cash flow, earnings and financial position.We may be unable to grow our revenues and increaseour profitability.Our revenue has fluctuated in recent years,in part through market conditions and, in 2007, 2009 and 2011, acquisitions that expanded our geographical footprint. We may beunable to grow our revenues for a variety of reasons, including decreased government funding for infrastructure projects, limitson additional growth in our current markets, reduced spending by our customers, an increased number of competitors, less successin competitive bidding for contracts, limitations on access to necessary working capital and investment capital to sustain growth,limitations on access to bonding to support increased contracts and operations, inability to hire and retain essential personneland to acquire equipment to support growth, and inability to identify acquisition candidates and successfully acquire and integratethem into our business. A substantial decline in our revenue could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andresults of operations if we are unable to also reduce our operating expenses. See “Recent Developments ― FinancialResults for 2015, Operational Issues and Outlook for 2016 Financial Results” above for further discussion of the impact onour financial results.11 Economic downturns or reductions in government fundingof infrastructure projects could reduce our revenues and profits and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is highly dependent on theamount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall conditionof the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmentalentities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons,including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects, including federal funding.The most recent recession caused a nationwide decline in home sales and an increase in foreclosures, which correspondingly resultedin decreases in property taxes and some other local taxes, which are among the sources of funding for municipal road, bridge andwater infrastructure construction. State spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delaysin, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us. We are reliant upon contracts with statetransportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues.See “Business−Our Markets andCustomers” above for a more detailed discussion of our markets and their funding sources.We operate in Texas, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona,California, Hawaii and to a lesser extent in other states, and adverse changes to the economy and business environment in thosestates have had an adverse effect on, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations, which could lead to lower revenuesand reduced profitability.Because of this concentration in specificgeographic locations, we are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in theseregions, including natural or other disasters. The stagnant or depressed economy, to varying degrees, in Texas, Utah, Nevada, Colorado,Arizona, California and Hawaii have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely effect, our business and results of operations.The cancellation of significant contracts or ourdisqualification from bidding for new contracts could reduce our revenues and profits and have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations.Contracts that we enter into with governmentalentities can usually be canceled at any time by them with payment only for the work already completed. In addition, we could beprohibited from bidding on certain governmental contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities. A cancellationof an unfinished contract or our debarment from the bidding process could cause our equipment and work crews to be idled for asignificant period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our businessand results of operations.Our industry is highly competitive, with a varietyof companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to usor adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded.In the past, a majority of the contractson which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimesrecognizing other factors, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer. For our design-build, CM/GCand other alternative methods of delivering projects, reputation, marketing efforts, quality of design and minimizing public inconvenienceare also significant factors considered in awarding contracts, in addition to cost. Within our markets, we compete with many international,national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors have achieved greater market penetration than we havein the markets in which we compete, and some may have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, there area number of international and national companies in our industry that are larger than we are and that, if they so desire, couldestablish a presence in our markets and compete with us for contracts.In some markets where residential and commercialprojects have significantly diminished, the bidding environment in our markets has been much more competitive as construction companiesthat lack available work in those markets have begun bidding on projects in our markets, sometimes at bid levels below our break-evenpricing. In addition, traditional competitors on larger transportation and water infrastructure projects also appear to have beenbidding at less than normal margins, and in some cases at below our break-even pricing, in order to replenish their backlogs. Asa result, we may need to accept lower contract margins in order to compete against competitors that have the ability to acceptawards at lower prices or have a pre-existing relationship with a customer.In addition, if the use of design-build,CM/GC and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilitiesand reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may havea material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to competesuccessfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced.12 Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers ofmaterials (including petroleum-based products) could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timelybasis or at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow.We rely on third-party subcontractors toperform some of the work on many of our contracts. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the necessary subcontractorscommitted for the anticipated scope of the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid, except in some instances fortrucking arrangements. Therefore, to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired.In addition, if a subcontractor is unable to deliver its services according to the negotiated terms for any reason, including thedeterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services from another source ata higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract.We also rely on third-party suppliers toprovide most of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, pipe, oil and fuel) for our contracts, exceptin Utah and Nevada where we source and produce some of the aggregates we use from quarries in which we have mining rights. We donot own or operate any quarries in Texas, Arizona, California, or Hawaii. We normally do not bid on contracts unless we have commitmentsfrom suppliers for the materials and subcontractors for certain of the services required to complete the contract and at pricesthat we have included in our bid, except for some construction projects in Utah and Nevada where we use aggregates from quarriesin which we have mining rights. Thus, to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials and subcontractorsfor certain of the services, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier or subcontractor is unableto deliver materials or services according to the negotiated terms of a supply/services agreement for any reason, including thedeterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the materials/services from anothersource at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, ona contract.Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based productsare utilized to operate the plants and equipment on which we rely to perform our construction contracts. In addition, our asphaltplants and suppliers use oil in combination with aggregates to produce asphalt used in our road and highway construction projects.Decreased supplies of such products relative to demand, unavailability of petroleum supplies due to refinery turnarounds, higherprices charged for petroleum based products and other factors can increase the cost of such products. Future increases in the costsof fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and thecosts of such products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or aloss, on a contract.We may not accurately assess the quality, and wemay not accurately estimate the quantity, availability and cost, of aggregates we plan to produce, particularly for projects inrural areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Particularly for projects in rural areas,we typically estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for anticipated aggregate sources that we have not previouslyused to produce aggregates, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regardingaggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delaysand other inefficiencies. As a result, our failure to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregatescould cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.If we are unable to attract and retain key personneland skilled labor, or if we encounter labor difficulties, our ability to bid for and successfully complete contracts may be negativelyimpacted.Our ability to attract and retain reliable,qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includesmembers of our management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers. The loss of theservices of any of our management could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our abilityto hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. If competition for these employees is intense, we couldexperience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining ourcurrent employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operationsand future earnings may be negatively impacted.13 We rely heavily on immigrant labor. Wehave taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannotprovide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all illegal immigrants who work for us. Our failureto identify illegal immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have amaterial adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.In Nevada, Arizona, California and Hawaii,a substantial number of our equipment operators and laborers are unionized. Any work stoppage or other labor dispute involvingour unionized workforce, or inability to renew contracts with the unions, could have a material adverse effect on our operationsand operating results.Our contracts may require us to perform extra orchange order work, which can result in disputes and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows.Our contracts often require us to performextra or change order work as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price ofthe extra work to be performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of thework included in the original project plans and specifications or, if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies asextra work, the price that the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. These disputes may not be settled to our satisfaction.Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for a lengthy periodof time until the change order is approved by the customer and we are paid by the customer.To the extent that actual recoveries withrespect to change orders or amounts subject to contract disputes or claims are less than the estimates used in our financial statements,the amount of any shortfall will reduce our future revenues and profits, and this could have a material adverse effect on our reportedworking capital and results of operations. In addition, any delay caused by the extra work may adversely impact the timely schedulingof other project work and our ability to meet specified contract milestone dates.Our failure to meet schedule or performance requirementsof our contracts could adversely affect us.In most cases, our contracts require completionby a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to meet any such schedule could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damagesbeing assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract. Performance problems on existing andfuture contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause usto suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers.The design-build project delivery method subjectsus to the risk of design errors and omissions.In the event of a design error or omissioncausing damages with respect to one of our design-build projects, we could be liable. Although we pass design responsibility onto the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design erroror omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors andomissions insurance that they and we purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting froman asserted design defect with respect to our construction projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position,results of operations and cash flows.Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, whichcould slow completion of our contracts and negatively affect our revenues and cash flow.Because all of our construction projectsare built outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severeif general climatic changes occur. For example, evacuations in Texas due to hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coastal areascan result in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winterweather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in lessefficient rates of overhead recovery. Extreme heat can prevent us from performing certain types of operations. During the latefall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in Nevada and Utah may also be curtailed becauseof snow and other work-limiting weather. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossibleto recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contractsboth in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negativelyaffect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed.Timing of the award and performance of new contractscould have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow.It is generally very difficult to predictwhether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design andbidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals.Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, andthe fluctuation may be substantial.14 The uncertainty of the timing of contractawards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases,we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of futureneeds for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received,we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.In addition, the timing of the revenues,earnings and cash flows from our contracts can be delayed by a number of factors, including adverse weather conditions, such asprolonged or intense periods of rain, snow, storms or flooding; delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and servicesfrom subcontractors; and changes in the scope of work to be performed. Such delays, if they occur, could have adverse effects onour operating results for current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed.Our participation in construction joint venturesexposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.As part of our business, we are a partyto joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companiesin the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends upon managing the risks discussed in the various risks describedin these “Risk Factors
” and on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations.We and our joint venture partners are generallyjointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to performor is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemmingfrom lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionateshare of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’sperformance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputationand reduction to our profit on a project.In connection with acquisitions, certaincounterparties to joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue sucharrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements. Any termination of ajoint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.Our dependence on a limited number of customers couldadversely affect our business and results of operations.Due to the size and nature of our constructioncontracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenuesand gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in 2015, approximately 13.5% of ourrevenue was generated from Texas Department of Transportation (“TXDOT”) and approximately 15.5% was generated by theCalifornia Department of Transportation (“Caltrans”). Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contractsfor certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. Examplesof this are TXDOT, Caltrans and Nevada Department of Transportation which comprised 25.7%, 14.1% and 11.4% of our backlog at December31, 2015, respectively. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our businessor results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer could materially adversely affectour business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintainequipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline.A significant portion of our contractsis built with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy constructionequipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we maybe forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts.The equipment that we own or lease requirescontinuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to continue to maintain the equipmentin our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third-party repair services, which could increase our costs. In addition, the marketvalue of our equipment may unexpectedly decline at a faster rate than anticipated.15 An inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregatedollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue.As is customary in the construction business,we are required to provide surety bonds to our customers to secure our performance under construction contracts. Our ability toobtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and reputationand certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in relationshipto the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affectthe insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being availableonly at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit the amount that we can bid on new contractsand could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.Our operations are subject to hazards that may causepersonal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance.Our workers are subject to the usual hazardsassociated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. Operating hazards can causepersonal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintaingeneral liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insuranceall in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all lossesor liabilities that we may incur in our operations.Insurance liabilities are difficult toassess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportionto other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insuranceclaims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintainor expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our operating results and financial condition couldbe materially and adversely affected.Environmental and other regulatory matters couldadversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect onour results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to various environmentallaws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, climate change and the emissionand discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our ownactivities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Ouroperations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things,regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Immigration laws require us to take certain steps intended to confirm the legalstatus of our immigrant labor force, but we may nonetheless unknowingly employ illegal immigrants. Violations of such laws andregulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injuryclaims. In addition, these laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasinglystringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed,or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to whichthey have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcementpolicies of the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution controlsystems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities.Our aggregate quarry leases in Utah andNevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarries, we could be held responsible for anycontamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarries. Any such costs and liabilitiescould be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Force majeure events, such as terrorist attacks ornatural disasters, have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy and the markets in which we operate.Force majeure events, such as terroristattacks or natural disasters, have contributed to economic instability in the United States in the past, and further acts of terrorism,violence, war, or natural disasters could affect the markets in which we operate, our business and our expectations. Armed hostilitiesmay increase, or terrorist attacks, or responses from the United States, may lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbancesin the United States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability in the United States. These force majeureevents may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, our production capabilityand our ability to complete contracts in a timely manner.16 We rely on information technology systems to conductour business, and disruption, failure or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our business and results ofoperations.We rely on information technology (“IT”)systems in order to achieve our business objectives.  We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technologyto securely maintain confidential information maintained on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products,solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond ourcontrol such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacksor other malicious software programs.  The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reasoncould disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data,processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers.  A significant disruption or failurecould have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.Risks Related to Our Financial Results and FinancingPlans.Actual results could differ from the estimates andassumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements.To prepare financial statements in conformitywith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), management is required to make estimatesand assumptions, as of the date of the financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenuesand expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:contract costs and profits; application of percentage-of-completion accounting and revenue recognition of contract change orderclaims; provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors, suppliers andothers; impairment of long-term assets; valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves; and stock-based compensation. Our actual resultscould differ from, and could require adjustments to, those estimates.In particular, as is more fully discussedin “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — CriticalAccounting Policies,” we recognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimatedcontract revenue is recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the contract for the period (based on the ratio of costsincurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Estimated contract losses arerecognized in full when determined. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on a continuous basis asthe work progresses and as change orders are initiated or approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage of completion arereflected in contract revenue in the accounting period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments resultin an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge againstcurrent earnings, which could be material.We may need to raise additional capital in the futurefor working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, whichwould impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.Our ability to obtain additional financingin the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as conditions in our business andour operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us.We have pledged the proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety, and we have pledged substantiallyall of our other assets as collateral in connection with our equipment-based credit facility. As a result, we may have difficultyin obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, underour equipment-based credit facility, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur any amount of additional debt from othersources (subject to certain exceptions). If future financing is obtained by the issuance of additional shares of common stock,our stockholders may suffer dilution. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may notbe able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.We are subject to certain covenantsunder our equipment-based credit facility that could limit our flexibility in managing our business.We have an equipment-based credit facilitythat restricts us from engaging in certain activities, including our ability (subject to certain exceptions) to:·incur liens or encumbrances;·incur further indebtedness;17 ·dispose of a material portion of assets or merge with a third party;·make acquisitions; and·make investments in securities.Our credit facility bears interest atan initial annual rate of 12%, which is subject to (i) a decrease of up to two percentage points based on the Company's fixedcharge coverage ratio for each of the most recently ended four quarters beginning with the four quarterly period ended June 30,2016; and (ii) an increase of up to two percentage points beginning December 31, 2015 based on the fixed charge coverage ratioat the end of the following four quarters. To the extent that the fixed charge ratio calculation described above results in aninterest rate increase, the increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financialperformance and financial condition.We are subject to a limitationon the amount that we can borrow under our equipment-based credit facility based on the value of our collateralized equipment.Our equipment-based credit facility issecured by all of the Company’s personal property except accounts receivable, including all of its construction equipment,which forms the basis of our borrowing capacity under our credit facility. This facility is also secured by one-half of the equipmentof the Company’s 50%-owned affiliates. The sum of the amount borrowed may not exceed the lesser of $40 million or 65% ofthe appraised value of the collateral pledged for the facility. At December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $29.6 millionof borrowing base which was the result of calculating 65% of the appraised value of the Company’s collateral. Based on marketconditions, which includes the amount of construction work available and the demand for construction equipment, the appraised valueof our equipment may be subject to fluctuating values. If these market conditions are unfavorable, we may see a decline in ourborrowing availability that could result in liquidity constraints, which could materially and adversely affect our business, resultsof operations and financial condition.We must manage our liquidity carefully to fund our working capital.The need for working capital for our businessvaries due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors:·contract receivables and contract retentions;·costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings;·billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings;·the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and·the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors.We have limited cash on hand and the timingof payments on our contract receivables are difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed or theamount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materially and adverselyaffected.If we were required to write down all or part ofour goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially and adversely affected.We had $54.8 million of goodwill recordedon our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assetsacquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. A shortfall in ourrevenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantlyreduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recordedon our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwillhas been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill to determine if it has become impaired. On an interim basis, we alsoreview the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing.Write downs of goodwill may be substantial. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill in futureperiods our net earnings and equity could be materially and adversely affected"
1,STRL,STERLING CONSTRUCTION CO INC,2015-03-16,"Risk Factors
. The risks described below are those we believe to be the material risks we face. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Relating to Our Business. If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when we bid on or negotiate a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract. The majority of our revenues and backlog are derived from fixed unit price contracts. Some of our revenues are derived from lump sum contracts. Fixed unit price contracts require us to provide materials and services at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price irrespective of our actual per unit costs. We realize a profit on our contracts only if we accurately estimate our costs and then successfully control actual costs and avoid cost overruns, and our revenues exceed actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not execute the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. The final results under these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.   12   The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: ·onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;·failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;·delays caused by weather conditions;·contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders;·changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;·inability to predict the costs of accessing and producing aggregates and purchasing oil required for asphalt paving projects;·availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;·failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customers to perform their obligations;·fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customers or our own personnel;·mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;·citations issued by any governmental authority, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;·difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;·changes in applicable laws and regulations;·delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during production; and·claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part. Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. Our experience has often been that public sector customers have been willing to negotiate equitable adjustments in the contract compensation or completion time provisions if unexpected circumstances arise. However, public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position. We may be unable to grow our revenues and increase our profitability. Our revenue has grown rapidly in recent years, in part through acquisitions that expanded our geographical footprint. We may be unable to grow our revenues for a variety of reasons, including decreased government funding for infrastructure projects, limits on additional growth in our current markets, reduced spending by our customers, an increased number of competitors, less success in competitive bidding for contracts, limitations on access to necessary working capital and investment capital to sustain growth, limitations on access to bonding to support increased contracts and operations, inability to hire and retain essential personnel and to acquire equipment to support growth, and inability to identify acquisition candidates and successfully acquire and integrate them into our business. A substantial decline in our revenue could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to also reduce our operating expenses. See “Recent Developments ― Financial Results for 2014, Operational Issues and Outlook for 2015 Financial Results” above for further discussion of the impact on our financial results. Economic downturns or reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects could reduce our revenues and profits and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects, including federal funding. The most recent recession caused a nationwide decline in home sales and an increase in foreclosures, which correspondingly resulted in decreases in property taxes and some other local taxes, which are among the sources of funding for municipal road, bridge and water infrastructure construction. State spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us. We are reliant upon contracts with state transportation departments for a significant portion of our revenues.   13  See “Business−Our Markets, Customers and Competition” above for a more detailed discussion of our markets and their funding sources. We operate in Texas, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, California, Hawaii and to a lesser extent in other states, and adverse changes to the economy and business environment in those states have had an adverse effect on, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations, which could lead to lower revenues and reduced profitability. Because of this concentration in specific geographic locations, we are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in these regions, including natural or other disasters. The stagnant or depressed economy, to varying degrees, in Texas, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, California and Hawaii have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely effect, our business and results of operations. The cancellation of significant contracts or our disqualification from bidding for new contracts could reduce our revenues and profits and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Contracts that we enter into with governmental entities can usually be canceled at any time by them with payment only for the work already completed. In addition, we could be prohibited from bidding on certain governmental contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities. A cancellation of an unfinished contract or our debarment from the bidding process could cause our equipment and work crews to be idled for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our growth strategy involves a number of risks. While for a number of years we have pursued revenue and profit growth through the acquisition of companies and assets that enabled us to expand our project skill-sets and capabilities, enlarge our geographic markets, add experienced management and enhance our ability to bid on larger contracts, we may be unable or unwilling to continue to implement this strategy if we cannot reach agreements for potential acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Risks related to growth, including growth through acquisitions, include: ·difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;·difficulties applying our expertise in one market into another market;·regulatory requirements that impose restrictions on bidding for certain projects because of historical operations by Sterling or the acquired company;·the key personnel, customers and project partners of the acquired company may terminate or diminish their relationships with the acquired company;·we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and financial reporting;·we may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities (including for environmental-related costs and liabilities) as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not discover during our due diligence;·we may not adequately anticipate competitive and other market factors applicable to the acquired company;·our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and·we may not be able to realize cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated or we may not realize the anticipated benefits in the time frame that we expected. Future growth, including growth through acquisitions, may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, as well as additional surety bonding capacity, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Moreover, to the extent that any acquisition results in additional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might have an adverse effect on our credit and bonding capacity. Management may have difficulty implementing its business strategy. We have recently experienced significant losses primarily related to projects constructed in Texas. If management is unable to timely implement its business strategy to return to profitability in its Texas, or other markets, our results of operations, cash flows and shareholder returns could be adversely affected. In addition, if a return to profitability does not occur within the time frame that we anticipate, or if we continue to incur losses in our Texas, or other markets, we may not have sufficient working capital to timely complete our construction projects. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, to alleviate our working capital constraints as we execute our business strategy to return to profitability we may need to liquidate assets, sell our owner’s interest in subsidiaries, or take other measures to provide sufficient working capital to continue our operations.   14  Our industry is highly competitive, with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded. In the past, a majority of the contracts on which we bid were awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other factors, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer. For our design-build, CM/GC and other alternative methods of delivering projects, reputation, marketing efforts, quality of design and minimizing public inconvenience are also significant factors considered in awarding contracts, in addition to cost. Within our markets, we compete with many international, national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors have achieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and some may have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, there are a number of international and national companies in our industry that are larger than we are and that, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our markets and compete with us for contracts. In some markets where residential and commercial projects have significantly diminished, the bidding environment in our markets has been much more competitive as construction companies that lack available work in those markets have begun bidding on projects in our markets, sometimes at bid levels below our break-even pricing. In addition, traditional competitors on larger transportation and water infrastructure projects also appear to have been bidding at less than normal margins, and in some cases at below our break-even pricing, in order to replenish their backlogs. As a result, we may need to accept lower contract margins in order to compete against competitors that have the ability to accept awards at lower prices or have a pre-existing relationship with a customer. In addition, if the use of design-build, CM/GC and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced. Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials (including petroleum-based products) could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow. We rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the necessary subcontractors committed for the anticipated scope of the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid, except in some instances for trucking arrangements. Therefore, to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a subcontractor is unable to deliver its services according to the negotiated terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide most of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, pipe, oil and fuel) for our contracts, except in Nevada where we source and produce some of the aggregates we use from quarries in which we have mining rights. We do not own or operate any quarries in Texas, Utah, Arizona, California, or Hawaii. We normally do not bid on contracts unless we have commitments from suppliers for the materials and subcontractors for certain of the services required to complete the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid, except for some construction projects in Nevada where we use aggregates from quarries in which we have mining rights. Thus, to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials and subcontractors for certain of the services, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier or subcontractor is unable to deliver materials or services according to the negotiated terms of a supply/services agreement for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the materials/services from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract. Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products are utilized to operate the plants and equipment on which we rely to perform our construction contracts. In addition, our asphalt plants and suppliers use oil in combination with aggregates to produce asphalt used in our road and highway construction projects. Decreased supplies of such products relative to demand, unavailability of petroleum supplies due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum based products and other factors can increase the cost of such products. Future increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and the costs of such products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract.   15  We may not accurately assess the quality, and we may not accurately estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost, of aggregates we plan to produce, particularly for projects in rural areas of Nevada, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Particularly for projects in rural areas of Nevada, we typically estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for anticipated aggregate sources that we have not previously used to produce aggregates, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regarding aggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delays and other inefficiencies. As a result, our failure to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor, or if we encounter labor difficulties, our ability to bid for and successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted. Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes members of our management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers. The loss of the services of any of our management could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. If competition for these employees is intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted. We rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all illegal immigrants who work for us. Our failure to identify illegal immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition. In Nevada, California and Hawaii, a substantial number of our equipment operators and laborers are unionized. Any work stoppage or other labor dispute involving our unionized workforce, or inability to renew contracts with the unions, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results. Our contracts may require us to perform extra or change order work, which can result in disputes and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows. Our contracts often require us to perform extra or change order work as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the extra work to be performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of the work included in the original project plans and specifications or, if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. These disputes may not be settled to our satisfaction. Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for a lengthy period of time until the change order is approved by the customer and we are paid by the customer. To the extent that actual recoveries with respect to change orders or amounts subject to contract disputes or claims are less than the estimates used in our financial statements, the amount of any shortfall will reduce our future revenues and profits, and this could have a material adverse effect on our reported working capital and results of operations. In addition, any delay caused by the extra work may adversely impact the timely scheduling of other project work and our ability to meet specified contract milestone dates. Our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts could adversely affect us. In most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to meet any such schedule could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract. Performance problems on existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers. The design-build project delivery method subjects us to the risk of design errors and omissions. In the event of a design error or omission causing damages with respect to one of our design-build projects, we could be liable. Although we pass design responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors and omissions insurance that they and we purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our construction projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   16  Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our contracts and negatively affect our revenues and cash flow. Because all of our construction projects are built outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, evacuations in Texas due to hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coastal areas can result in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. Extreme heat can prevent us from performing certain types of operations. During the late fall to the early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in Nevada and Utah may also be curtailed because of snow and other work-limiting weather. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed. Timing of the award and performance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial. The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit. In addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from our contracts can be delayed by a number of factors, including adverse weather conditions, such as prolonged or intense periods of rain, snow, storms or flooding; delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and services from subcontractors; and changes in the scope of work to be performed. Such delays, if they occur, could have adverse effects on our operating results for current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed. Our participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends upon managing the risks discussed in the various risks described in these “Risk Factors
” and on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduction to our profit on a project. In connection with acquisitions, certain counterparties to joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements. Any termination of a joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations.   17  Due to the size and nature of our construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in 2014, approximately 9.1% of our revenue was generated from North Texas Tollway Authority (“NTTA”) and approximately 14.5% was generated by Caltrans. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. Examples of this are TxDOT and Caltrans which comprised 30.6% and 23.2% of our backlog at December 31, 2014, respectively. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline. A significant portion of our contracts is built with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts. The equipment that we own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to continue to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third-party repair services, which could increase our costs. In addition, the market value of our equipment may unexpectedly decline at a faster rate than anticipated. An inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue. As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide surety bonds to our customers to secure our performance under construction contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding would limit the amount that we can bid on new contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects. Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance. Our workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, auto insurance and other types of insurance all in amounts consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   18  Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, climate change and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Immigration laws require us to take certain steps intended to confirm the legal status of our immigrant labor force, but we may nonetheless unknowingly employ illegal immigrants. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, these laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities. Our aggregate quarry lease in Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarry, we could be held responsible for any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarry. Any such costs and liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Terrorist attacks have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy and the markets in which we operate. Terrorist attacks, like those that occurred on September 11, 2001, have contributed to economic instability in the United States, and further acts of terrorism, violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate, our business and our expectations. Armed hostilities may increase, or terrorist attacks, or responses from the United States, may lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the United States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability in the United States. These attacks or armed conflicts may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, our production capability and our ability to complete contracts in a timely manner. We rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, and disruption, failure or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We rely on information technology (“IT”) systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential information maintained on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Financing Plans. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements. To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), management is required to make estimates and assumptions, as of the date of the financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: contract costs and profits; application of percentage-of-completion accounting and revenue recognition of contract change order claims; provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors, suppliers and others; impairment of long-term assets; valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves; and stock-based compensation. Our actual results could differ from, and could require adjustments to, those estimates. In particular, as is more fully discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies,” we recognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the contract for the period (based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on a continuous basis as the work progresses and as change orders are initiated or approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in the accounting period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.   19  We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us. We have pledged the proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety, and we have pledged substantially all of our other assets as collateral in connection with our credit facility and mortgage debt. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, under our credit facility, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur any amount of additional debt from other sources (subject to certain exceptions). If future financing is obtained by the issuance of additional shares of common stock, our stockholders may suffer dilution. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges. We are subject to financial and other covenants under our credit facility that could limit our flexibility in managing our business. We have a credit facility that restricts us from engaging in certain activities, including our ability (subject to certain exceptions) to: ·make distributions, pay dividends and buy back shares;·incur liens or encumbrances;·incur other indebtedness;·guarantee obligations;·dispose of a material portion of assets;·engage in a merger with a third party; and·make acquisitions. Our credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain specified asset ratios and leverage ratios, and to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth. Our ability to borrow funds for any purpose will depend on our satisfying these tests. If we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or fail to comply with any of the other restrictions contained in our credit facility, an event of default could occur. An event of default, if not waived by our lenders, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness, causing such debt to become immediately due and payable. If such acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay such indebtedness on a timely basis. Acceleration of our credit facility could result in foreclosure on and loss of our operating assets. In the event of such foreclosure, we would be unable to conduct our business and forced to discontinue operations. We must manage our liquidity carefully to fund our working capital. The need for working capital for our business varies due to fluctuations in the following amounts, among other factors: ·contract receivables and contract retentions;·costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings;·billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings;·the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings; and·the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors. We have limited cash on hand and the timing of payments on our contract receivables are difficult to predict. If the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed or the amount of such payments is less than expected, our liquidity and ability to fund working capital could be materially and adversely affected. If we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially and adversely affected. We had $54.8 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition. A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. We perform an annual test of our goodwill to determine if it has become impaired. On an interim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing. Write downs of goodwill may be substantial. For example, in 2011, our annual test indicated that goodwill was impaired, and as a result we recorded a charge of $67.0 million representing approximately 55% of the $121 million of recorded goodwill prior to the write down. As a result, the Company incurred a significant loss for 2011 and equity declined by $41.8 million. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill in future periods our net earnings and equity could be materially and adversely affected.   20 "

. The risks described below are those we believe to be the material risks we face.  Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Relating to Our Business. If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when we bid on or negotiate a contract that is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract. The majority of our revenues and backlog are derived from fixed unit price contracts. Some of our revenues are derived from lump sum contracts. Fixed unit price contracts require us to provide materials and services at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual per unit costs. Lump sum contracts require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price irrespective of our actual per unit costs. We realize a profit on our contracts only if we successfully estimate our costs and then successfully control actual costs and avoid cost overruns, and our revenues exceed actual costs. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not execute the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. The final results under these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position. The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: ·  onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract; ·  failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract; ·  delays caused by weather conditions; ·  contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders; ·  changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment; ·  inability to predict the costs of accessing and producing aggregates and purchasing oil required for asphalt paving projects; ·  availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project; ·  failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customers to perform their obligations; ·  fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, joint venture partners or customers or our own personnel; ·  mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment; ·  citations issued by any governmental authority, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; ·  difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals; ·  changes in applicable laws and regulations; and ·  claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part. Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. Our experience has often been that public sector customers have been willing to negotiate equitable adjustments in the contract compensation or completion time provisions if unexpected circumstances arise. Public sector customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, and we could face increased risks, which may adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.   14Table of Contents We may be unable to sustain our historical revenue growth rate and maintain our profitability. We may be unable to sustain our historical revenue growth rates for a variety of reasons, including decreased government funding for infrastructure projects, limits on additional growth in our current markets, reduced spending by our customers, an increased number of competitors, less success in competitive bidding for contracts, limitations on access to necessary working capital and investment capital to sustain growth, limitations on access to bonding to support increased contracts and operations, inability to hire and retain essential personnel and to acquire equipment to support growth, and inability to identify acquisition candidates and successfully acquire and integrate them into our business. Due to some of these factors, we currently anticipate that our net income and diluted earnings per share of stock attributable to Sterling common stockholders for 2011 will be below the results that we achieved in 2010. A substantial decline in our revenue could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to also reduce our operating expenses. Economic downturns or reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects could reduce our revenues and profits and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is highly dependent on the amount and timing of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Spending on infrastructure could decline for numerous reasons, including decreased revenues received by state and local governments for spending on such projects, including federal funding. The nationwide decline in home sales, the increase in foreclosures and a prolonged recession have resulted in decreases in property taxes and some other local taxes, which are among the sources of funding for municipal road, bridge and water infrastructure construction. State spending on highway and other projects can be adversely affected by decreases or delays in, or uncertainties regarding, federal highway funding, which could adversely affect us. We are reliant upon contracts with TXDOT, UDOT and NDOT for a significant portion of our revenues. Recent reductions in miles driven in the U.S. and more fuel efficient vehicles have reduced federal and state gasoline taxes and tolls collected. In addition, the federal government has not renewed the five-year $244 billion SAFETEA-LU bill, which provided states with substantial funding for transportation infrastructure projects. Since the SAFETEA-LU bill expired on September 30, 2009, the federal government has been extending financial assistance on an interim basis, most recently through September 30, 2011. Reductions in federal funding may negatively impact the states’ highway and bridge construction contract awards for 2011. We are unable to predict when or on what terms the federal government might renew the SAFETEA-LU bill or enact other similar legislation. While our business includes only minimal residential and commercial infrastructure work, the severe fall-off in new projects in those markets has resulted in some residential and commercial infrastructure contractors bidding on some public sector transportation and water infrastructure projects, sometimes at bid levels below our break-even pricing. Traditional competitors on larger transportation and water infrastructure projects also appear to have been bidding at less than normal margins and, in some cases at bid levels below our break-even pricing, in order to replenish their reduced backlogs. These conditions have increased competition and created downward pressure on bid prices in our markets. These and other factors have limited our ability to maintain or increase our backlog through successful bids for new projects and have limited the profitability of new projects that we do obtain through successful bids. These adverse competitive trends may continue or worsen. We operate in Texas, Utah, Nevada, and to a lesser extent in other states, and adverse changes to the economy and business environment in those states have had an adverse effect on, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations, which could lead to lower revenues and reduced profitability. Because of this concentration in specific geographic locations, we are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in these regions, including natural or other disasters. The stagnant or depressed economy, to varying degrees, in Texas, Utah and Nevada have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely effect, our business and results of operations. The cancellation of significant contracts or our disqualification from bidding for new contracts could reduce our revenues and profits and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Contracts that we enter into with governmental entities can usually be canceled at any time by them with payment only for the work already completed. In addition, we could be prohibited from bidding on certain governmental contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities. A cancellation of an unfinished contract or our debarment from the bidding process could cause our equipment and work crews to be idled for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   15Table of Contents Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks. We intend to continue pursuing growth through the acquisition of companies or assets that may enable us to expand our project skill-sets and capabilities, enlarge our geographic markets, add experienced management and enhance our ability to bid on larger contracts. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot reach agreements for potential acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including: ·  difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; ·  difficulties applying our expertise in one market into another market; ·  regulatory requirements that impose restrictions on bidding for certain projects because of historical operations by Sterling or the acquired company; ·  the key personnel, customers and project partners of the acquired company may terminate or diminish their relationships with the acquired company; ·  we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and financial reporting; ·  we may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities (including for environmental-related costs and liabilities) as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not discover during our due diligence; ·  we may not adequately anticipate competitive and other market factors applicable to the acquired company; ·  our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and ·  we may not be able to realize cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated or we may not realize the anticipated benefits in the time frame that we expected. Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, as well as additional surety bonding capacity, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Moreover, to the extent that any acquisition results in additional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might have an adverse effect on our credit and bonding capacity. Our industry is highly competitive, with a variety of companies competing against us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded. A majority of the contracts on which we bid are awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other factors, such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer. For our design-build, CM/GC and other alternative methods of delivering projects, reputation, marketing efforts, quality of design and minimizing public inconvenience are also significant factors considered in awarding contracts, in addition to cost. Within our markets, we compete with many national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors have achieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and some may have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, there are a number of national companies in our industry that are larger than we are and that, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our markets and compete with us for contracts. In some markets where residential and commercial projects have significantly diminished, the bidding environment in our markets has been much more competitive as construction companies that lack available work in those markets have begun bidding on projects in our markets, sometimes at bid levels below our break-even pricing. In addition, traditional competitors on larger transportation and water infrastructure projects also appear to have been bidding at less than normal margins, and in some cases at below our break-even pricing, in order to replenish their reduced backlogs. As a result, we may need to accept lower contract margins in order to compete against competitors that have the ability to accept awards at lower prices or have a pre-existing relationship with a customer. In addition, if the use of design-build, CM/GC and other alternative project delivery methods continues to increase and we are not able to further develop our capabilities and reputation in connection with these alternative delivery methods, we will be at a competitive disadvantage, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could also be reduced. Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials (including petroleum-based products) could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow. We rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the necessary subcontractors committed for the anticipated scope of the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid, except for trucking arrangements needed for our Nevada operations. Therefore, to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a subcontractor is unable to deliver its services according to the negotiated terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide most of the materials (including aggregates, cement, asphalt, concrete, steel, pipe, oil and fuel) for our contracts, except in Nevada where we source and produce most of the aggregates we use. We do not own or operate any quarries in Texas or Utah. We normally do not bid on contracts unless we have commitments from suppliers for the materials and subcontractors for certain of the services required to complete the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid, except for some aggregates we use in our Nevada construction projects. Thus, to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials and subcontractors for certain of the services, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier or subcontractor is unable to deliver materials or services according to the negotiated terms of a supply/services agreement for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the materials/services from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract. Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products are utilized to operate the plants and equipment on which we rely to perform our construction contracts. In addition, our asphalt plants and suppliers use oil in combination with aggregates to produce asphalt used in our road and highway construction projects. Decreased supplies of such products relative to demand, unavailability of petroleum supplies due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum based products and other factors can increase the cost of such products. Future increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and the costs of such products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract.   16Table of Contents We may not accurately assess the quality, and we may not accurately estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates we plan to produce, particularly for projects in rural areas of Nevada, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Particularly for projects in rural areas of Nevada, we typically estimate the quality, quantity, availability and cost for anticipated aggregate sources that we have not previously used to produce aggregates, which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. Inaccuracies in our estimates regarding aggregates could result in significantly higher costs to supply aggregates needed for our projects, as well as potential delays and other inefficiencies. As a result, our failure to accurately assess the quality, quantity, availability and cost of aggregates could cause us to incur losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We may not be able to fully realize the revenue anticipated by our reported backlog. Backlog is our estimate of the revenues that we expect to earn in future periods on our construction projects. We generally add the anticipated revenue value of each new project to our backlog when management reasonably determines that we will be awarded the contract and there are no known impediments to being awarded the contract. We deduct from backlog the revenues earned on each project during the applicable fiscal period. As construction on our projects progresses, we also increase or decrease backlog to take into account our estimates of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changed conditions, change orders and other variations from initially anticipated contract revenues, including completion penalties and bonuses. Actual results may differ from the expectations and estimates we rely upon in determining backlog. Most of the contracts with our public sector customers can be terminated at their discretion. If a customer cancels, suspends, delays or reduces a contract, we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically will not be able to bill the total amount that had been reflected in our backlog. Cancellation of one or more contracts that constitute a large percentage of our backlog, and our inability to find a substitute contract, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor, or if we encounter labor difficulties, our ability to bid for and successfully complete contracts may be negatively impacted. Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes members of our management, project managers, estimators, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers. The loss of the services of any of our management could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to hire and retain, or to attract when needed, highly-skilled personnel. If competition for these employees is intense, we could experience difficulty hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted. We rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that we have identified, or will identify in the future, all illegal immigrants who work for us. Our failure to identify illegal immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon us, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition. In Nevada and Hawaii, a substantial number of our equipment operators and laborers are unionized. Any work stoppage or other labor dispute involving our unionized workforce would have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results. Our contracts may require us to perform extra or change order work, which can result in disputes and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows. Our contracts often require us to perform extra or change order work as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the extra work to be performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of the work included in the original project plans and specifications or, if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. These disputes may not be settled to our satisfaction. Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for a lengthy period of time until the change order is approved by the customer and we are paid by the customer. To the extent that actual recoveries with respect to change orders or amounts subject to contract disputes or claims are less than the estimates used in our financial statements, the amount of any shortfall will reduce our future revenues and profits, and this could have a material adverse effect on our reported working capital and results of operations. In addition, any delay caused by the extra work may adversely impact the timely scheduling of other project work and our ability to meet specified contract milestone dates. Our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts could adversely affect us. In most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to meet any such schedule could result in additional costs, penalties or liquidated damages being assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract. Performance problems on existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within the industry and among our customers. The design-build project delivery method subjects us to the risk of design errors and omissions. In the event of a design error or omission causing damages with respect to one of our design-build projects, we could be liable. Although we pass design responsibility on to the engineering firms that we engage to perform design services on our behalf for these projects, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the engineering firm, its professional liability insurance, and the errors and omissions insurance that they and we purchase will not fully protect us from costs or liabilities. Any liabilities resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our construction projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   17Table of Contents Adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of our contracts and negatively affect our revenues and cash flow. Because all of our construction projects are built outdoors, work on our contracts is subject to unpredictable weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe if general climatic changes occur. For example, evacuations in Texas due to Hurricanes Rita and Ike resulted in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days. Lengthy periods of wet or cold winter weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery. For example, during the first quarter of 2010, we experienced an above-average number of days of rainfall across our Texas markets, which impeded our ability to work on construction projects and reduced our revenues and gross profit. During the late fall to early spring months of each year, our work on construction projects in Nevada and Utah may also be curtailed because of snow and other work-limiting weather. While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossible to recover the cost of inefficiencies, and significant periods of bad weather typically reduce profitability of affected contracts both in the current period and during the future life of affected contracts. Such reductions in contract profitability negatively affect our results of operations in current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed. Timing of the award and performance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contracts will be offered for tender, as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, funding arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuation may be substantial. The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our equipment fleet and work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more equipment and ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit. In addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from our contracts can be delayed by a number of factors, including adverse weather conditions, such as prolonged or intense periods of rain, snow, storms or flooding; delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and services from subcontractors; and changes in the scope of work to be performed. Such delays, if they occur, could have adverse effects on our operating results for current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed. Our participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners. As part of our business, we are a party to joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends upon managing the risks discussed in the various risks described in these “Risk Factors
” and on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations. We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduction to our profit on a project. In connection with acquisitions certain counterparties to joint venture arrangements, which may include our historical direct competitors, may not desire to continue such arrangements with us and may terminate the joint venture arrangements or not enter into new arrangements. Any termination of a joint venture arrangement could cause us to reduce our backlog and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our dependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Due to the size and nature of our construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the past and may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in 2010, approximately 20.7% of our revenue was generated from TXDOT, approximately 26.2% was generated by UDOT and approximately 6.4% of our revenue was generated from NDOT.  Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for individual customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. Examples of this are TXDOT, which comprised 16.5% of our backlog, UDOT which comprised 25.3% of our backlog and NTTA which comprised 17.4% of our backlog at December 31, 2010. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may incur higher costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, and the market value of our owned equipment may decline. We have traditionally owned most of the construction equipment used to build our projects. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts. The equipment that we own or lease requires continuous maintenance, for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable to continue to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third-party repair services, which could increase our costs. In addition, the market value of our equipment may unexpectedly decline at a faster rate than anticipated.   18Table of Contents An inability to obtain bonding could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue. As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide surety bonds to our customers to secure our performance under construction contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding, and, as a result, to bid on new contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects. Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance. Our workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing construction and related services on construction sites, plants and quarries. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. Except for RLW, which has workers compensation insurance, we self-insure our workers’ compensation and health claims, subject to stop-loss insurance coverage. We also maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks that we believe are consistent with industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might also be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extent that we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers’ compensation and health claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, climate change and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for such contamination created not only from our own activities but also from the historical activities of others on our project sites or on properties that we acquire or lease. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Immigration laws require us to take certain steps intended to confirm the legal status of our immigrant labor force, but we may nonetheless unknowingly employ illegal immigrants. Violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. In addition, these laws and regulations have become, and enforcement practices and compliance standards are becoming, increasingly stringent. Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among other things, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities. Our aggregate quarry lease in Nevada could subject us to costs and liabilities. As lessee and operator of the quarry, we could be held responsible for any contamination or regulatory violations resulting from activities or operations at the quarry. Any such costs and liabilities could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Terrorist attacks have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy and the markets in which we operate. Terrorist attacks, like those that occurred on September 11, 2001, have contributed to economic instability in the United States, and further acts of terrorism, violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate, our business and our expectations. Armed hostilities may increase, or terrorist attacks, or responses from the United States, may lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the United States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability in the United States. These attacks or armed conflicts may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, our production capability and our ability to complete contracts in a timely manner. Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Financing Plans. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements. To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions, as of the date of the financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include: contract costs and profits; application of percentage-of-completion accounting and revenue recognition of contract change order claims; provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors, suppliers and others; impairment of long-term assets; valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves; and stock-based compensation. Our actual results could differ from, and could require adjustments to, those estimates. In particular, as is more fully discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies,” we recognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the contract for the period (based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract) to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on a continuous basis as the work progresses and as change orders are initiated or approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in the accounting period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.   19Table of Contents We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us. We have pledged the proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety, and we have pledged substantially all of our other assets as collateral in connection with our credit facility and mortgage debt. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral. In addition, under our credit facility, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur any amount of additional debt from other sources (subject to certain exceptions). If future financing is obtained by the issuance of additional shares of common stock, our stockholders may suffer dilution. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges. We are subject to financial and other covenants under our credit facility that could limit our flexibility in managing our business. We have a credit facility that restricts us from engaging in certain activities, including restrictions on our ability (subject to certain exceptions) to: ·  make distributions, pay dividends and buy back shares; ·  incur liens or encumbrances; ·  incur indebtedness; ·  guarantee obligations; ·  dispose of a material portion of assets or otherwise engage in a merger with a third party; ·  make acquisitions; and ·  incur losses for two consecutive quarters. Our credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain specified fixed charge coverage ratios, asset ratios and leverage ratios, and to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth. Our ability to borrow funds for any purpose will depend on our satisfying these tests. If we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or fail to comply with any of the other restrictions contained in our credit facility, an event of default could occur. An event of default, if not waived by our lenders, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness, causing such debt to become immediately due and payable. If such acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay such indebtedness on a timely basis. Acceleration of our credit facility could result in foreclosure on and loss of our operating assets. In the event of such foreclosure, we would be unable to conduct our business and forced to discontinue operations. If we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially and adversely affected. We had approximately $114.7 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. A shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysis and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.  If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. We perform an annual review of our goodwill and intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired, which would require us to write down the impaired portion of these assets.  On an interim basis, we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing.  If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially and adversely affected.   20Table of Contents "
9,STRL,STERLING CONSTRUCTION CO INC,2007-03-16,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.The risk factors described below are those which we believe are the material risks that face theCompany. Any of these risk factors could significantly and adversely affect our business,prospects, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Relating to Our BusinessIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks or costs when we bid on a contractwhich is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a losson the contract.Substantially all of our revenues and contract backlog are typically derived from fixed unit pricecontracts. Fixed unit price contracts require us to perform the contract for a fixed unit priceirrespective of our actual costs. As a result, we realize a profit on these contracts only if wesuccessfully estimate our costs and then successfully control actual costs and avoid cost overruns.If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not execute the contract withinour cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause the contract not to be as profitable as weexpected, or may cause us to incur losses. This, in turn, could negatively affect our cash flow,earnings and financial position.The costs incurred and gross profit realized on those contracts can vary, sometimes substantially,from the original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:  onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;   delays caused by weather conditions;   later contract start dates than expected when we bid the contract;   contract modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders;   changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete,aggregate and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel and sand), as well as fueland lubricants for our equipment;   availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;   our suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform;   fraud or theft committed by our employees;   mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;   citations issued by governmental authorities, including the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration;   difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;   changes in applicable laws and regulations; and   claims or demands from third parties alleging damages arising from our work or from theproject of which our work is part.Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some orall of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly atfault. Our practice in many instances has been to supersede these terms with an agreement to obtaininsurance covering both the customer and ourselves. In cases where insurance is not obtained, ourexperiencePage 12Table of Contentshas often been that public sector customers have been willing to negotiate equitableadjustments in the contract compensation or completion time provisions if unexpected circumstancesarise. If we are unable to obtain insurance, and if public sector customers seek to imposecontractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, we could face increased risks, which mayadversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.Economic downturns or reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects, or thecancellation of significant contracts, could reduce our revenues and profits and have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is highly dependent on the amount of infrastructure work funded by variousgovernmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the needfor new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded bygovernmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Decreases ingovernment funding of infrastructure projects could decrease the number of civil constructioncontracts available and limit our ability to obtain new contracts, which could reduce our revenuesand profits.Contracts that we enter into with governmental entities can usually be canceled at any time by themwith payment only for the work already completed. In addition, we could be prohibited from biddingon certain governmental contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities.A sudden cancellation of a contract or our debarment from the bidding process could cause ourequipment and work crews to remain idled for a significant period of time until other comparablework became available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.Our operations are currently focused in Texas, and any adverse change to the economy orbusiness environment in Texas could significantly affect our operations, which would lead to lowerrevenues and reduced profitability.Our operations are currently concentrated in Texas, with a majority of our contracts undertaken inthe Houston area. Because of this concentration in a specific geographic location, we aresusceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in thisregion, including natural or other disasters. A stagnant or depressed economy in Texas generallyor in Houston specifically, or in any of the other markets that we serve, could adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.Our industry is highly competitive, with a variety of larger companies with greater resourcescompeting with us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contractsawarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded.Essentially all of the contracts on which we bid are awarded through a competitive bid process,with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other factors,such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer. Within our markets, wecompete with many national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors haveachieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and some havegreater financial and other resources than we have. In addition, there are a number of nationalcompanies in our industry that are larger than us that, if they so desired, could establish apresence in our markets and compete with us for contracts. As a result, we may need to acceptlower contract margins in order to compete against these competitors. If we are unable to competesuccessfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could be reduced.Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials, including petroleum-basedproducts, could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basisor at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow.We rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts. We donot bid on contracts unless we have the necessary subcontractors committed for the anticipatedscope of the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid. Therefore, to the extentthat we cannotPage 13Table of Contentsengage subcontractors, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. Inaddition, if a subcontractor is unable to deliver its services according to the negotiated termsfor any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and berequired to purchase the services from another source at a higher price. This may reduce theprofit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract.We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide most of the materials for our contracts, includingaggregates, cement, concrete, steel and pipe. We do not own any quarries, and there are nonaturally occurring sources of aggregate in the Houston metropolitan area. In recent years we haveadded several concrete plants and have acquired property for the storage of recycled concrete inorder to reduce our dependence on third parties and lower some of the costs of concrete and basematerials. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have commitments from suppliers for thematerials required to complete the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid. Thus,to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials, our ability tobid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier is unable to deliver materialsaccording to the negotiated terms of a supply agreement for any reason, including the deteriorationof its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the materials fromanother source at a higher price. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss,on a contract.Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products are utilized to operate the equipment used in ourconstruction contracts. Decreased supplies of those products relative to demand and other factorscan cause an increase in their cost. Future increases in the costs of fuel and otherpetroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for acontract and the costs of those products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual coststhereof, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue anticipated by our reported contractbacklog.As indicated above, at January 1, 2007, our contract backlog was approximately $395 million.Almost all of our contracts are awarded by public sector customers through a competitive bidprocess, with the award generally being made to the lowest bidder. We add new contracts to ourannounced contract backlog, typically when we are the low bidder on a public sector contract andhave determined that there are no apparent impediments to award of the contract. As constructionon our contracts progresses, we increase or decrease contract backlog to take account of changes inestimated quantities under fixed unit price contracts, as well as to reflect changed conditions,change orders and other variations from initially anticipated contract revenues and costs,including completion penalties and bonuses. We subtract from contract backlog the amounts we billon contracts.Most of the contracts with our public sector customers can be terminated at their discretion. If acustomer cancels, suspends, delays or reduces a contract, we may be reimbursed for certain costs,but typically will not be able to bill the total amount that had been reflected in our contractbacklog. Cancellation of one or more contracts that constitute a large percentage of our contractbacklog, and our inability to find a substitute contract, would have a material adverse effect onour business, results of operations and financial condition.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to bid for and successfullycomplete contracts may be negatively impacted.Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor thataffects our ability to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includesmembers of our management team, project managers, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators andlaborers. The loss of the services of any of our management could have a material adverse effecton us. Our futuresuccess will also depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly-skilled personnel.Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty hiring andretaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining ourcurrentPage 14Table of Contentsemployees and attracting new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and ourfuture earnings may be negatively impacted.Our contracts may require us to perform extra or change order work, which can result indisputes and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows.Our contracts generally require us to perform extra or change order work as directed by thecustomer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the extra work tobe performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond thescope of the work included in the original project plans and specifications or, if the customeragrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing topay for the extra work. These disputes may not be settled to our satisfaction. Even when thecustomer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of that work for alengthy period of time until the change order is approved by the customer and we are paid by thecustomer.To the extent that actual recoveries with respect to change orders or amounts subject to contractdisputes or claims are less than the estimates used in our financial statements, the amount of anyshortfall will reduce our future revenues and profits, and this could have a material adverseeffect on our reported working capital and results of operations. In addition, any delay caused bythe extra work may adversely impact the timely scheduling of other project work and our ability tomeet specified contract milestones.Our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts could adverselyaffect us.In most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to meetany such schedule could result in additional costs being incurred, penalties and liquidated damagesbeing assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract.Performance problems on existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations todiffer materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to ourreputation within the industry and among our customers.Timing of the award and performance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on ouroperating results and cash flow.At any time, a substantial portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of largeconstruction contracts. It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when new contractswill be offered for tender, as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex design andbidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, financingarrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results of operations andcash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the fluctuations may besubstantial.The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the sizeof work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of a readywork crew that is larger than currently required, in anticipation of future employee needs forexisting contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contractaward is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on ouranticipated profit.In addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from our contracts can be delayedby a number of factors, including adverse weather conditions such as prolonged or intense periodsof rain, storms or flooding, delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and changesin the scope of work to be performed. Those delays, if they occur, could have an adverse effect onour operating results for a particular period.Our dependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect our business and resultsof operations.Due to the size and nature of our construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the pastand may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and grossprofits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in 2006,approximately 85% ofPage 15Table of Contentsour revenues was generated from three customers. Similarly, our contractbacklog frequently reflects multiple contracts for individual customers; therefore, one customermay comprise a significant percentage of contract backlog at a certain point in time. An exampleof this is TXDOT, with which we had 24 separate contracts representing an aggregate ofapproximately 82% of our contract backlog at January 1, 2007. The loss of business from any one ofthose customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.Because our customers are government entities and we do not maintain any reserves for paymentdefaults, a delay or default in payment on a significant scale could materially adversely affectour business, results of operations and financial condition.We may incur higher costs to acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, andthe market value of our equipment may decline.We have traditionally owned most of the construction equipment used to build our projects, and wedo not bid on contracts for which we do not have, or cannot quickly procure (whether throughacquisition, lease or rent), the necessary equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buyconstruction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding orequipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis,which could increase the costs of completing contracts. In addition, our equipment requirescontinuous maintenance for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable tocontinue to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third-party repairservices, which could increase our costs.The market value of our equipment may unexpectedly decline at a faster rate than anticipated. Sucha decline would reduce the borrowing base under our credit facility, thereby reducing the amount ofcredit available to us and impeding our ability to expand our business consistent with historicallevels.Unanticipated adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of ourcontracts and negatively affect our revenues and cash flow.Because all of our construction projects are built outdoors, work on our contracts is subject tounpredictable weather conditions. Lengthy periods of wet weather will generally interruptconstruction, and this can lead to under-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in lessefficient rates of overhead recovery. While revenues can be recovered following a period of badweather, it is generally impossible to recover the efficiencies, and hence, we may sufferreductions in the expected profit on contracts.An inability to obtain bonding could limit the number of contracts that we are able topursue.As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide surety bonds to secure ourperformance under construction contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily dependsupon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and reputation andcertain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companiesconsider those factors in relation to the amount of our contract backlog and their underwritingstandards, which may change from time to time. For instance, by 2006 we had outgrown the bondinglimits of our surety bonding company and were required to arrange a new source of bonding. Eventsthat affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming moredifficult to obtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Ourinability to obtain adequate bonding, and, as a result, to bid on new contracts, could have amaterial adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects.Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage,thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered byinsurance.Our workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing services on constructionsites. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to, or destruction of,property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We self-insure our workers compensationclaims,Page 16Table of Contentssubject to stop-loss insurance coverage. We also maintain insurance coverage in amountsand against the risks that we believe are consistent with industry practice, but this insurance maynot be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations.Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including theseverity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, thenumber of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were toexperience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might also be required to use workingcapital to satisfy these claims rather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extentthat we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workerscompensation claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our operating results andfinancial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct ourbusiness and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to themanagement, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge ofpollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for the contamination created not onlyby our own activities but also by the historical activities of others on our project sites or onproperties that we acquire. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating toworkplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure tohazardous substances. Violations of those laws and regulations could subject us to substantialfines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. Inaddition, these laws and regulations have become, and are becoming, increasingly stringent.Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirementsthat could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered orinterpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied.Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policiesof the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among otherthings, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or theacquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities.Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.In addition to organic growth of our construction business, we intend to pursue growth through theacquisition of companies or assets that may enable us to expand our project skill-sets andcapabilities, enlarge our geographic markets, add experienced management and increase critical massto enable us to bid on larger or more complex contracts. However, we may be unable to implementthis growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential acquisitions on acceptable terms, ifthe acquisition target does not have attractive business characteristics, including adequatemanagement, or for other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks,including:  difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;   the key personnel and customers of the acquired company may terminate their relationshipswith the acquired company;   we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areassuch as tax planning and financial reporting;   we may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities (including forenvironmental-related costs) as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may notdiscover during our due diligence;   our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and   we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.Page 17Table of ContentsAcquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not beavailable on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, to the extent that any acquisition results inadditional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might have an adverse effect onour credit and bonding capacity.We may be unable to sustain our historical revenue growth rate.Our revenue has grown rapidly in recent years. Our revenue increased by 14% from $219 million in2005 to $249 million in 2006. However, we may be unable to sustain our recent revenue growth ratefor a variety of reasons, including limits on additional growth in our current markets, lesssuccess in competitive bidding for contracts, limitations on access to necessary working capitaland investment capital to sustain growth, limitations on access to bonding to support increasedcontracts and operations, the inability to hire and retain essential personnel and to acquireequipment to support growth, and the inability to complete acquisitions and successfully integratethem into our business. A decline in our revenue growth could have a material adverse effect onour financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to reduce the growth of ouroperating expenses at the same rate.Terrorist attacks have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy andthe markets in which we operate.Acts of terrorism, violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate, our business andour expectations. Armed hostilities may increase, or terrorist attacks, or responses to terroristattacks by the United States may lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in theUnited States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability in the UnitedStates. These attacks or armed conflicts may affect our operations or those of our customers orsuppliers and could impact our revenues, our production capability and our ability to completecontracts in a timely manner.Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Financing PlansActual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare ourfinancial statements.To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America, or US GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions asof the date of the financial statements which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities,revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiringsignificant estimates by our management include contract costs and profits, application ofpercentage-of-completion accounting, and revenue recognition of contract change order claims;provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs fromsubcontractors, suppliers and others; valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed inconnection with business combinations; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation andinsurance reserves; and the value of our deferred tax assets. Because the Company is anaccelerated filer under SEC rules, starting in 2007 we will be required to file quarterly andannual reports with the SEC earlier than in the past, which will increase the extent to which wewill be making the estimates referred to above. Our actual results could differ from thoseestimates.In particular, as is more fully discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading Critical Accounting Policies, werecognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimatedcontract revenue is recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the contract for theperiod to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognizedinfull when determined. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on acontinuous basis as the work progresses and as change orders are initiated or approved, andadjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in theaccounting period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result inan increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize acredit or a charge against current earnings, as appropriate, which could be material.Page 18Table of ContentsWe may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expendituresand/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which wouldimpair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.Our growth has benefited in part from our utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards, orNOLs, to reduce our income taxes, and we expect our NOLs to be fully utilized in 2007. To theextent that cash flow from operations is insufficient to make future investments, make acquisitionsor provide needed additional working capital, we may require additional financing from othersources of funds.Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailingcapital market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; thosefactors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us. Wehave pledged substantially all of our fixed assets as collateral in connection with our creditfacility, and our bonding capacity is dependent on maintaining an acceptable level of unencumberedworking capital. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in thefuture if the financing requires us to pledge our assets as collateral. In addition, under ourcredit facility, we must obtain the consent of our lender to incur any amount of additional debtfrom other sources (subject to certain exceptions). If future financing is obtained by theissuance of additional shares of common stock, our existing stockholders may suffer dilution. Ifadequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able tomake future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond tocompetitive challenges.We are subject to financial and other covenants under our credit facility that could limit ourflexibility in managing our business.Our revolving credit facility restricts us from engaging in certain activities, includingrestrictions on the ability (subject to certain exceptions) to   make distributions and dividends;   incur liens or encumbrances;   incur further indebtedness;   guarantee obligations;   dispose of a material portion of assets or otherwise engage in a merger with a third party;and   incur negative income for two consecutive quarters.Our credit facility also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a specified debtto tangible net worth ratio and cash flow coverage ratio. In addition, the facility provides thatthe Company may at no time have two consecutive fiscal quarters with losses aggregating in excessof $500,000. Our ability to borrow funds for any purpose will depend on our satisfying thosecovenants. If we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or fail to comply withany of the other restrictions contained in our credit facility agreement, an event of default couldoccur. An event of default, if not waived by our lenders, could result in the acceleration of anyoutstanding indebtedness, causing that debt to become immediately due and payable. If such anacceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay the indebtedness on a timely basis. Because ourcredit facility is secured by substantially all of our fixed assets, acceleration of this debtcould result in foreclosure of those assets. In the event of a foreclosure, we could be unable toconduct our business and might be forced to discontinue operations.We may not be able to utilize all of our NOLs if we experience an ownership change, and, evenabsent an ownership change, we expect that our NOLs will be fully utilized in 2007.At December 31, 2006, we had NOLs of approximately $9.8 million. These NOLs will expire in theyear 2020, although the amount available in any year to offset our net taxable income will bereduced if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, asamended, or the Code. The tax laws pertaining to NOLs may be changed from time to time such thatthe NOLs may not be available to shield our future income from federal taxation. In addition,Page 19Table of Contentsourattempts to minimize the likelihood that an ownership change will occur may not be successful.Finally, we expect to use up all of our NOLs in offsetting our federally-taxable income in 2007.After the NOLs become unavailable to us or are fully utilized, our future income will not beshielded from federal income taxation, thereby reducing funds otherwise available for generalcorporate purposes.Changes to the current tax laws will result in the imposition of entity level taxation on ourconstruction operating subsidiary, which will result in a reduction in our anticipated cashflow.Our construction operating subsidiary is organized as a Texas limited partnership, which in thepast was not subject to entity-level federal income or Texas state franchise tax. In 2006, theTexas legislature adopted a new law that has the effect of imposing an entity-level tax upon ourconstruction operating subsidiary, which is expected to reduce our net income and after-tax cashflow by approximately 1%.We will be exposed to risks relating to the evaluations of internal controls over financialreporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.We have completed the systems and process evaluations and testing of our internal financial controlsystems (and made necessary remediation) that are required to comply with the managementcertification and auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002. Our systems are designed to produce accurate financial reports and to prevent fraudulentfinancial activity. We are required to comply with Section 404 beginning with this Annual Reporton Form 10-K. As a public company, we are now required to report, among other things, controldeficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal controls that materiallyaffect, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect internal controls over financialreporting. A material weakness is a significant control weakness, or combination of significantdeficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of theannual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. If any material weaknessor deficiency is identified or is not remedied, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy ofour reported financial information, and our stock price could be significantly adversely affectedas a result"
10,STRL,STERLING CONSTRUCTION CO INC,2006-03-29,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The risk factors described below are those which we believe are the material risks that face theCompany. Any of these risk factors could significantly and adversely affect our business,prospects, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Relating to Our BusinessIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks orcosts when we bid on a contract which is ultimately awarded to us, we may achieve a lower thananticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.Substantially all of our revenues and contract backlog are typically derived from fixed unit pricecontracts. Fixed unit price contracts require us to perform the contract for a fixed unit priceirrespective of our actual costs. As a result, we realize a profit on these contracts only if wesuccessfully estimate our costs and then successfully control actual costs and avoid cost overruns.If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not execute the contract withinour cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur losses or cause the contract not to beas profitable as we expected. This, in turn, could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings andfinancial position.The costs incurred and gross profit realized on those contracts can vary, sometimes substantially,from the original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:  onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;   delays caused by weather conditions;   contract modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders;   changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete,aggregate and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel and sand), as well as fueland lubricants for our equipment;   availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;   our suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform;   fraud or theft committed by our employees;   mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;   citations issued by a governmental authority, including the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration;   difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;   changes in applicable laws and regulations; and   claims or demands from third parties alleging damages arising from our work or from theproject of which our work is part.Many of our contracts with public sector customers contain provisions that purport to shift some orall of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly atfault. Our practice in many instances has been to supersede these terms with an agreement to obtaininsurance covering both the customer and ourselves. In cases where insurance is not obtained, ourexperience has often been that public sector customers have been willing to negotiate equitableadjustments in the contract compensation or completion time provisions if unexpected circumstancesarise. If we are unable to obtain insurance, and if public sector customers seek to imposecontractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, we could face increased risks, which mayadversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.Page 12Table of ContentsEconomic downturns or reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects, or thecancellation of significant contracts, could reduce our revenues and profits and have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is highly dependent on the amount of infrastructure work funded by variousgovernmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the needfor new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded bygovernmental entities and federal, state or local government spending levels. Decreases ingovernment funding of infrastructure projects could decrease the number of civil constructioncontracts available and limit our ability to obtain new contracts, which could reduce our revenuesand profits.Contracts that we enter into with governmental entities can usually be canceled at any time by themwith payment only for the work already completed. In addition, we could be prohibited from biddingon certain governmental contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities.A sudden cancellation of a contract or our debarment from the bidding process could cause ourequipment and work crews to remain idled for a significant period of time until other comparablework became available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.Our operations are currently focused in Texas, and any adverse change to the economy orbusiness environment in Texas could significantly affect our operations, which would lead to lowerrevenues and reduced profitability.Our operations are currently concentrated in Texas, and primarily in the Houston area. Because ofthis concentration in a specific geographic location, we are susceptible to fluctuations in ourbusiness caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region, including natural or otherdisasters. A stagnant or depressed economy in Texas generally or in Houston specifically, or inany of the other markets that we serve, could adversely affect our business, results of operationsand financial condition.Our industry is highly competitive, with a variety of larger companies with greater resourcescompeting with us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contractsawarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded.Essentially all of the contracts on which we bid are awarded through a competitive bid process,with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes recognizing other factors,such as shorter contract schedules or prior experience with the customer. Within our markets, wecompete with many national, regional and local construction firms. Some of these competitors haveachieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and some havegreater financial and other resources than we have. In addition, there are a number of nationalcompanies in our industry that are larger than us that, if they so desired, could establish apresence in our markets and compete with us for contracts. As a result, we may need to acceptlower contract margins in order to compete against these competitors. If we are unable to competesuccessfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could be reduced.Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials, including petroleum-basedproducts, could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basisor at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow.We rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts. We donot bid on contracts unless we have the necessary subcontractors committed for the anticipatedscope of the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid. Therefore, to the extentthat we cannot engage subcontractors, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. Inaddition, if a subcontractor is unable to deliver its services according to the negotiated termsfor any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and berequired to purchase the services from another source at a higher price. This may reduce theprofit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract.Page 13Table of ContentsWe also rely on third-party suppliers to provide all of the materials, including aggregates,concrete, steel and pipe, for our contracts. We do not own any quarries, and there are nonaturally occurring sources of aggregate in the Houston metropolitan area. We do not bid oncontracts unless we have commitments from suppliers for the materials required to complete thecontract and at prices that wehave included in our bid. Thus, to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliersfor materials, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier isunable to deliver materials according to the negotiated terms of a supply agreement for any reason,including the deterioration of its financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required topurchase the materials from another source at a higher price. This may reduce the profit to berealized, or result in a loss, on a contract.Diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products are utilized to operate the equipment used in ourconstruction contracts. Decreased supplies of those products relative to demand and other factorscan cause an increase in their cost. Future increases in the costs of fuel and otherpetroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for acontract and the costs of those products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual coststhereof, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract.We may not be able to fully realize the revenue anticipated by our reported contractbacklog.As indicated above, at January 1, 2006, our contract backlog was approximately $307 million.Almost all of our contracts are awarded by public sector customers through a competitive bidprocess, with the award generally being made to the lowest bidder. We add new contracts to ourannounced contract backlog, typically when we are the low bidder on a public sector contract andhave determined that there are no apparent impediments to award of the contract. As constructionon our contracts progresses, we increase or decrease contract backlog to take account of changes inestimated quantities under fixed unit price contracts, as well as to reflect changed conditions,change orders and other variations from initially anticipated contract revenues and costs,including completion penalties and bonuses. We subtract from contract backlog the amounts we billon contracts.Most of the contracts with our public sector customers can be terminated at their discretion. If acustomer cancels, suspends, delays or reduces a contract, we may be reimbursed for certain costs,but typically will not be able to bill the total amount that had been reflected in our contractbacklog. Cancellation of one or more contracts that constitute a large percentage of our contractbacklog, and our inability to find a substitute contract, would have a material adverse effect onour business, results of operations and financial condition.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to bid for and successfullycomplete contracts may be negatively impacted.Our ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor thataffects our ability to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includesmembers of our management team, project managers, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators andlaborers. The loss of the services of any of our management could have a material adverse effecton us. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilledpersonnel. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty hiringand retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retainingour current employees and attracting new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed andour future earnings may be negatively impacted.Our contracts may require us to perform extra or change order work, which can result indisputes and adversely affect our working capital, profits and cash flows.Our contracts generally require us to perform extra or change order work as directed by thecustomer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the extra work tobe performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond thePage 14Table of Contentsscope of the work included in the original project plans and specifications or, if the customeragrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing topay for the extra work. These disputes may not be settled to our satisfaction. Even when thecustomer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of that work for alengthy period of time until the change order is approved by the customer and we are paid by the customer.To the extent that actual recoveries with respect to change orders or amounts subject to contractdisputes or claims are less than the estimates used in our financial statements, the amount of anyshortfall will reduce our future revenues and profits, and this could have a material adverseeffect on our reported working capital and results of operations. In addition, any delay caused bythe extra work may adversely impact the timely scheduling of other project work and our ability tomeet specified contract milestones.Our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts could adverselyaffect us.In most cases, our contracts require completion by a scheduled acceptance date. Failure to meetany such schedule could result in additional costs being incurred, penalties and liquidated damagesbeing assessed against us, and these could exceed projected profit margins on the contract.Performance problems on existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations todiffer materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to ourreputation within the industry and among our customers.Timing of the award and performance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on ouroperating results and cash flow.At any point in time, a substantial portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number oflarge construction contracts. It is generally very difficult to predict whether and when newcontracts will be offered for tender, as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complexdesign and bidding process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions,financing arrangements and governmental approvals. Because of these factors, our results ofoperations and cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, and thefluctuation may be substantial.The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the sizeof work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of a readywork crew that is larger than currently required, in anticipation of future employee needs forexisting contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contractaward is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on ouranticipated profit.In addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from our contracts can be delayedby a number of factors, including adverse weather conditions such as prolonged or intense periodsof rain, storms or flooding, delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and changesin the scope of work to be performed. Those delays, if they occur, could have an adverse effect onour operating results for a particular period.Our dependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect our business and resultsof operations.Due to the size and nature of our construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the pastand may in the future represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and grossprofits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in 2005,approximately 75% of our revenues was generated from three customers. Similarly, our contractbacklog frequently reflects multiple contracts for individual customers; therefore, one customermay comprise a significant percentage of contract backlog at a certain point in time. An exampleof this is TXDOT, with which we had 20 separate contracts representing an aggregate ofapproximately 79% of our contract backlog at January 1, 2006. The loss of business from any one ofthose customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.Because we do not maintain anyPage 15Table of Contentsreserves for payment defaults, a default or delay in payment on asignificant scale could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.We may incur higher costs to acquire and maintain equipment necessary for our operations, andthe market value of our equipment may decline.We have traditionally owned most of the construction equipment used to build our projects, and wedo not bid on contracts for which we do not have, or cannot quickly procure (whether throughacquisition or lease), the necessary equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buyconstruction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding orequipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis,which could increase the costs of completing contracts. In addition, our equipment requirescontinuous maintenance for which we maintain our own repair facilities. If we are unable tocontinue to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain third-party repairservices, which could increase our costs.The market value of our equipment may unexpectedly decline at a faster rate than anticipated. Sucha decline would reduce the borrowing base under our construction business credit facility, therebyreducing the amount of credit available to us and impeding our ability to expand our businessconsistent with historical levels.Unanticipated adverse weather conditions may cause delays, which could slow completion of ourcontracts and negatively affect our revenues and cash flow.Because all of our construction projects are built outdoors, work on our contracts is subject tounpredictable weather conditions. For example, evacuations due to Hurricane Rita in September 2005resulted in our inability to perform work on all Houston-area contracts for several days. Lengthyperiods of wet weather will generally interrupt construction, and this can lead tounder-utilization of crews and equipment, resulting in less efficient rates of overhead recovery.While revenues can be recovered following a period of bad weather, it is generally impossible torecover the efficiencies, and hence, we may suffer reductions in the expected profit on contracts.An inability to obtain bonding could limit the number of contracts that we are able topursue.As is customary in the construction business, we are required to provide surety bonds to secure ourperformance under construction contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily dependsupon our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and reputation andcertain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Surety companiesconsider those factors in relation to the amount of our contract backlog and their underwritingstandards, which may change from time to time. For instance, we recently outgrew the bondinglimits of our prior surety bonding company and arranged a new source of bonding. Events thataffect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult toobtain in the future, or being available only at a significantly greater cost. Our inability toobtain adequate bonding, and, as a result, to bid on new contracts, could have a material adverseeffect on our future revenues and business prospects.Our operations are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage,thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered byinsurance.Our workers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing services on constructionsites. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to, or destruction of,property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We self-insure our workers compensationclaims, subject to stop-loss insurance coverage. We also maintain insurance coverage in amountsand against the risks that we believe are consistent with industry practice, but this insurance maynot be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur in our operations.Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and quantify due to unknown factors, including theseverity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, thenumber of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If we were toexperience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might also be required to use workingcapital to satisfy these claimsPage 16Table of Contentsrather than to maintain or expand our operations. To the extentthat we experience a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workerscompensation claims, or unfavorable developments on existing claims, our operating results andfinancial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct ourbusiness and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to themanagement, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge ofpollutants into the air and water. We could be held liable for the contamination created not onlyby our own activities but also by the historical activities of others on our project sites or onproperties that we acquire. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating toworkplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, regulate employee exposure tohazardous substances. Violations of those laws and regulations could subject us to substantialfines and penalties, cleanup costs, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. Inaddition, these laws and regulations have become, and are becoming, increasingly stringent.Moreover, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of legislation or regulatory requirementsthat could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered orinterpreted, with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied.Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policiesof the regulatory agencies, could require us to make substantial expenditures for, among otherthings, pollution control systems and other equipment that we do not currently possess, or theacquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities.Our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.In addition to organic growth of our construction business, we intend to pursue growth through theacquisition of companies or assets that may enable us to expand our project skill-sets andcapabilities, enlarge our geographic markets, add experienced management and increase critical massto enable us to bid on larger or more complex contracts. However, we may be unable to implementthis growth strategy if we cannot reach agreement on potential acquisitions on acceptable terms orfor other reasons. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including:  difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;   the key personnel and customers of the acquired company may terminate their relationshipswith the acquired company;   we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areassuch as tax planning and financial reporting;   we may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities (including forenvironmental-related costs) as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may notdiscover during our due diligence;   our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and   we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.Future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not beavailable on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, to the extent that any acquisition results inadditional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might have an adverse effect onour credit and bonding capacity.We may be unable to sustain our historical revenue growth rate.Our revenue has grown rapidly in recent years. Our revenue increased by 66% from $132 million in2004 to $219 million in 2005. However, we may be unable to sustain our recent revenue growth ratefor a variety of reasons, including limits on additional growth in our current markets, lesssuccess in competitive bidding for contracts, limitations on access to necessary working capitaland investmentPage 17Table of Contentscapital to sustain growth, limitations on access to bonding to support increasedcontracts and operations, the inability to hire and retain essential personnel and to acquireequipment to support growth, and the inability to identify acquisition candidates and successfullyintegrate them into our business. A decline in our revenue growth could have a material adverseeffect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to reduce the growthof our operating expenses atthe same rate.Terrorist attacks have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy andthe markets in which we operate.Terrorist attacks, like those that occurred on September 11, 2001, have contributed to economicinstability in the United States, and further acts of terrorism, violence or war could affect themarkets in which we operate, our business and our expectations. Armed hostilities may increase, orterrorist attacks, or responses from the United States, may lead to further acts of terrorism andcivil disturbances in the United States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economicinstability in the United States. These attacks or armed conflicts may affect our operations orthose of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, our production capability andour ability to complete contracts in a timely manner.Our discontinued operations subject us to continuing liabilities and other risks.We will remain subject to the liabilities of Steel City Products distribution business until it issold. For further information on Steel City Products, see Item 7  Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Because we have reclassified thebusiness as being held for sale, customers may become concerned about the continued viability ofthe business and may purchase their products elsewhere, and suppliers may become concerned aboutthe continued viability of the business and limit shipments to us, thereby decreasing the revenuesand income earned by the business. For similar reasons, we may have difficulty attracting andretaining qualified personnel, the businesss reputation may be harmed, and future earnings may benegatively impacted. We may also have difficulty finding a purchaser for the business, and we willincur costs in connection with the disposition of the business and could continue to remainresponsible for certain liabilities after a sale. As a result, we may record a loss fromdiscontinued operations, and we may also incur a loss upon the sale of the business. In addition,we may have contractual or other further liabilities with respect to the discontinued operationsafter a sale of the distribution business is completed.Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Financing PlansActual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare ourfinancial statements.To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America, or US GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions asof the date of the financial statements which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities,revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiringsignificant estimates by our management include contract costs and profits, application ofpercentage-of-completion accounting, and revenue recognition of contract change order claims;provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs fromsubcontractors, suppliers and others; valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed inconnection with business combinations; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation andinsurance reserves; and the value of our deferred tax assets. Our actual results could differ fromthose estimates.In particular, as is more fully discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading Critical Accounting Policies, werecognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimatedcontract revenue is recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the contract forPage 18Table of Contentstheperiod to the total estimated revenue for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognizedin full when determined. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on acontinuous basis as the work progresses and as change orders are initiated or approved, andadjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in theaccounting period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result inan increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize acredit or a charge against current earnings, as appropriate, which could be material.We may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expendituresand/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which wouldimpair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.In addition to our bank lines of credit, we have in the past relied upon financing from ourmanagement and directors to support a portion of our growth, but we do not expect to utilize thatsource for financing in the future. In addition, our growth has benefited in part from ourutilization of net operating loss carry-forwards, or NOLs, to reduce the amounts that we have paidfor income taxes, and we expect our NOLs to be fully utilized in 2007. To the extent that cashflow from operations is insufficient to make future investments, make acquisitions or provideneeded additional working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources of funds.Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailingcapital market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; thosefactors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us. Wehave pledged substantially all of our fixed assets as collateral in connection with our creditfacilities, and our bonding capacity is dependent on maintaining an acceptable level ofunencumbered working capital. As a result, we may have difficulty in obtaining additionalfinancing in the future if the financing requires us to pledge our assets as collateral. Inaddition, under our credit facilities, we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur anyamount of additional debt from other sources (subject to certain exceptions). If future financingis obtained by the issuance of additional shares of common stock, our existing stockholders maysuffer dilution. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, wemay not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities,or respond to competitive challenges.We are subject to financial and other covenants under our credit facilities that could limitour flexibility in managing our business.Our construction business and our discontinued operations each has a revolving credit facility thatrestricts the borrower from engaging in certain activities, including restrictions on the ability(subject to certain exceptions) to:  make distributions and dividends;   incur liens or encumbrances;   incur further indebtedness;   guarantee obligations;   dispose of a material portion of assets or otherwise engage in a merger with a third party;   pledge accounts receivable, in the case of the Steel City Products revolving creditfacility; and   incur negative income for two consecutive quarters, in the case of the constructionbusiness revolving credit facility.Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain, in the case of theconstruction business revolving credit facility, a specified debt ratio and cash flow coverageratio, and in the case of the Steel City Products revolving credit facility, a specified fixedcharge coverage ratio. Our ability to borrow funds for any purpose will depend on our satisfyingthese tests. If we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or fail to comply withany of the other restrictions contained in our credit facility agreements, an event of defaultcould occur. An event of default, ifPage 19Table of Contentsnot waived by our lenders, could result in the accelerationof any outstanding indebtedness, causing that debt to become immediately due and payable. If suchan acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay the indebtedness on a timely basis. Becauseour construction business credit facility is secured by substantially all of the constructionbusiness fixed assets and the Steel City Products revolving credit facility is secured bysubstantially all of the Steel City Products assets, accelerationof this debt could result in foreclosure of those assets. In addition, the Steel City Productsrevolving credit facility includes a subjective acceleration clause. In the event of aforeclosure, we could be unable to conduct our business and may be forced to discontinueoperations.We may not be able to utilize all of our NOLs if we experience an ownership change, and, evenabsent an ownership change, we expect that our NOLs will be fully utilized by 2008.At December 31, 2005, we had NOLs of approximately $26.6 million. These NOLs will expire in theyears 2008 through 2020, although the amount available in any year to offset our net taxable incomewill be reduced if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of1986, as amended, or the Code. The tax laws pertaining to NOLs may be changed from time to timesuch that the NOLs may not be available to shield our future income from federal taxation. Inaddition, our attempts to minimize the likelihood that an ownership change will occur may not besuccessful. Finally, we expect that most of our federally-taxable income will be offset by NOLsthrough 2007, which is when we expect to have used up all of our NOLs. After the NOLs becomeunavailable to us or are fully utilized, our future income will not be shielded from federal incometaxation, thereby reducing funds otherwise available for general corporate purposes.Changes to the current tax laws could result in the imposition of entity level taxation on ourconstruction operating subsidiary, which would result in a reduction in our anticipated cashflow.Our construction operating subsidiary is organized as a Texas limited partnership, which generallyis not subject to entity level federal income or state franchise tax in the jurisdiction in whichit is organized and operates. Current laws may change, subjecting our construction operatingsubsidiary to entity level taxation. For example, because of state budget deficits, the Texaslegislature has been considering and evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity leveltaxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. If Texaswere to impose an entity-level tax upon our construction operating subsidiary, there would be areduction in our net income and after-tax cash flow.We will be exposed to risks relating to the evaluations of internal controls over financialreporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.We are currently in the process of evaluating our internal control systems to allow management toreport on, and our independent auditors to attest as to the effectiveness of, our internal controlsover financial reporting. We will be completing the systems and process evaluations and testing(and making any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification andauditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These systemsare designed to produce accurate financial reports and to prevent fraudulent financial activity.We expect to be required to comply with Section 404 beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the year ending December 31, 2006. However, we cannot be certain as to the timing ofcompletion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on ouroperations. Furthermore, upon completion of this process, we may identify control deficiencies ofvarying degrees of severity under applicable SEC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Boardrules and regulations, which may remain un-remediated. As a public company, we will be required toreport, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changesin internal controls that, or that are reasonably likely to, materially affect internal controlsover financial reporting. A material weakness is a significant control weakness, or combinationof significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a materialmisstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Ifwe fail to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we may be subject tosanctions or investigation byPage 20Table of Contentsregulatory authorities such as the SEC or The Nasdaq National Market on which the Companys commonstock is traded. In addition, if any material weakness or deficiency is identified or is notremedied, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our reported financial information, andour stock price could be significantly adversely affected as a result"
