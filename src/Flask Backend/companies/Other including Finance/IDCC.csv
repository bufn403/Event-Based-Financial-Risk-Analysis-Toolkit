7,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2024-02-15,"     RISK FACTORS.We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.Risks Related to Our BusinessChallenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements and renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements. Most implementers of our technology do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions. The process of identifying users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense. Some infringers may act in bad faith, by attempting to hold out on taking a license altogether or behaving opportunistically in license negotiations. Even good faith negotiations are often very long and complex, involving significant company time and resources. Given these challenges, we cannot ensure that we will be able to enter into patent license agreements either at all or on terms acceptable to us. Additionally, given the large number of implementers using our patented inventions, we may not be able to identify all potential licensees. Once identified, it is not feasible for us to seek licenses from all users of our patented technologies, so we may have to make strategic decisions with respect to which companies we should approach for license negotiations. Uncertainty related to entry into new license agreements could impact our forecasts and ultimately, revenue, cash flow and business.13Table of ContentsWe also face challenges in renewing our existing license agreements. Although we endeavor to renew license agreements prior to their expiration, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before the expiration of the license agreement, or at all. If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee. If we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements prior to their expiration, at all or on terms that are favorable to us, our forecasts, revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.Royalty rates, or other terms, under our patent license agreements could be subject to determination through arbitration or other third-party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings, and arbitrators, judges or other third-party adjudicators or regulators could make unfavorable determinations.Historically, we strive for the terms of our patent license agreements, including our royalty rates, to be reached through arms-length bilateral negotiations with our licensees. We could agree, as we did with Samsung pursuant to a binding arbitration agreement, to have royalty rates, and any other disputed terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators). We have no guarantee that the royalty rates or other terms set by arbitrators, courts or other third parties will be favorable to us. It is possible that courts or regulators could decide to set or otherwise determine the FRAND consistency of such terms or the manner in which such terms are determined, including by determining a worldwide royalty rate for our SEPs. Changes to or clarifications of our obligations to be prepared to offer licenses to SEPs on FRAND terms and conditions could require such terms, including our royalty rates, to be determined through third party adjudications. Finally, we and certain of our current and prospective licensees have initiated, and we and others could in the future initiate, legal proceedings or regulatory proceedings requesting third party adjudicators or regulators to set FRAND terms and conditions for a worldwide license to our SEPs, or to determine the FRAND-consistency of current terms and conditions in our patent license agreements. In particular, in 2021, the IP Tribunal of the Supreme People’s Court of the People’s Republic of China (SPC) affirmed its position that in certain SEP licensing disputes, Chinese courts can set worldwide royalty rates, and in December 2023, the Chongqing First Intermediate People’s Court issued such a decision setting a worldwide rate for Nokia’s cellular patents in response to a complaint filed by Oppo. We currently face similar proceedings that Oppo initiated before the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court to determine a worldwide rate for our 3G, 4G, 5G, 802.11 and HEVC SEPs.  If the court in our case applied the same framework as the court did in the Nokia decision, our standard essential patent portfolio would be significantly devalued as it relates to the FRAND royalty Oppo should pay. Also in 2023, Tesla and certain of its subsidiaries filed a claim in the UK High Court against InterDigital and Avanci seeking a determination of what the FRAND terms would be for a worldwide license between Tesla and Avanci covering Avanci’s 5G Connected Vehicle platform. To the extent that our patent royalty rates for our patent license agreements are determined through arbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings rather than through bilateral negotiations, because such proceedings are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and there are currently few precedents for such determinations, it is possible that royalty rates may be lower than our comparable rates. This could also have a negative impact on royalties we are able to obtain from future licensees, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow. Prospective customers may delay, and in some cases have delayed, negotiations on the basis of an adverse decision. In addition, to the extent that other terms and conditions for our patent license agreements are determined through such means, such terms and conditions could be less favorable than our historical terms and conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our licensing business. 14Table of ContentsWe could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights and to defend our licensing practices.While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices or services that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying users and potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if a third party implementer is unwilling to take a license on reasonable terms or in a reasonable time frame, or at all, we have in the past commenced, and may in the future commence, legal or administrative actions against such third parties to enforce our intellectual property rights. In turn, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, counterclaims and other legal proceedings that challenge the essential nature of our patents, or that claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Litigation adversaries have and may continue to allege that we have not complied with certain commitments to standards-setting organizations and therefore that we are not entitled to the relief that we seek. For example, Lenovo and other parties have alleged that we have not complied with an obligation to offer a license to a party on FRAND terms and conditions. Parties have also filed, and may in the future file, antitrust claims, unfair competition claims or regulatory complaints on that or other bases, and may seek damages and other relief based on such claims. Litigation adversaries have also filed against us, and other third parties may in the future file, validity challenges such as inter partes proceedings in the USPTO or the China National Intellectual Property Administration, which can lead to delays of our patent infringement actions as well as potential findings of invalidity. Such parties may also seek to obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential or are unenforceable.Litigation may be also required to protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others. The cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property and of defending our licensing practices has been and may continue to be significant, in particular with rising fees from outside counsel. As a result, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including in certain jurisdictions the costs and fees of opposing counsel if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.Potential patent and litigation reform legislation, potential USPTO and international patent rule changes, potential legislation affecting mechanisms for patent enforcement and available remedies, and potential changes to the intellectual property rights (“IPR”) policies of worldwide standards bodies, as well as rulings in legal proceedings, may affect our investments in research and development and our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and could have a material adverse effect on our licensing business as well as our business as a whole.  Potential changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our research and development investments, patent prosecution costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure, the number of forums in which we can seek to enforce our patents, the remedies that we may be entitled to in patent litigation, and attorneys’ fees or other remedies that could be sought against us, and may require us to reevaluate and modify our research and development activities and patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies. For example, the State Administration for Market Regulation in China regularly reviews its policies related to intellectual property and antitrust laws, and any such review could result in ambiguous standards and/or create a worse position for patent holders like us. Additionally, the European Commission (“EC”) has initiated a review of the EU’s IP policies as they relate to SEPs and FRAND. This review is currently being discussed and debated inside the European Parliament and the European Council and any change to the legal or regulatory landscape as a result of this review could impact our ability to negotiate license agreements on favorable terms or at all, while also limiting our potential legal remedies and materially impacting our business. Further, legislation designed to reduce the value of SEPs and alter the U.S. patent system, including legislation designed to reduce the jurisdiction and remedial authority of the USITC, has periodically been introduced in Congress.Any potential changes in the law, the IPR policies of standards bodies or other developments that reduce the available forums or the types of relief available in such forums (such as injunctive relief), restrict permissible licensing practices (such as our ability to license on a worldwide portfolio basis) or that otherwise cause us to seek alternative forums (such as arbitration or state court), would make it more difficult for us to enforce our patents, whether in adversarial proceedings or in negotiations. Because we have historically depended on the availability of certain forms of legal process to enforce our patents and obtain fair and adequate compensation for our investments in research and development and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, developments that undermine our ability to do so could have a negative impact on future licensing efforts.15Table of ContentsRulings in our legal proceedings, as well as those of third parties, may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and royalty rate setting and enforcement. For example, in the past, the USITC and U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have taken actions that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees, including us. Decisions that occur in the U.S. or in international forums may change the law applicable to various patent law issues, such as, for example, patentability, validity, claim construction, patent exhaustion, patent misuse, permissible licensing practices, available forums, and remedies such as damages and injunctive relief, in ways that are detrimental to the ability of patentees to enforce patents and obtain suitable relief. There are regularly discussions within the EC regarding potential regulations and policy changes that could determine how and whether a patent is essential to a standard. The risk of having our patents determined essential based on a single methodology or specific criteria and conditions associated with patent enforcement and licensing as imposed by the EC would affect our strategies as well. Ongoing uncertainty related to the feasibility and criteria used for this evaluation as well as the cost associated with such essentiality determination could impact the assessment of our SEP portfolio.We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.Our plans to renew license agreements with current licensees as well as additional handset manufacturers in China may be adversely affected by a deterioration in United States-China trade and geopolitical relations, our customers facing economic uncertainty there or our failure to establish a positive reputation in China, which could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.Companies headquartered in China currently comprise a substantial portion of the handset manufacturers that remain unlicensed to our patent portfolio. Our ability to renew license agreements with current licensees in China as well as license new manufacturers is, among other things, affected by the macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as well as our business relationships and perceived reputation in China. The U.S. and Chinese governments are regularly engaged in various trade discussions, and the U.S. State Department originally issued a travel advisory in January 2019 and reissued this travel advisory on January 11, 2023 advising U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution in China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws. In January 2020, the U.S. and China entered into Phase One of the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China (the ""Phase One Trade Agreement""). The Phase One Trade Agreement takes steps to ease certain trade tensions between the U.S. and China, including tensions involving intellectual property theft and forced intellectual property transfers by China. Although the Phase One Trade Agreement was an encouraging sign of progress in the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, questions still remain as to the enforcement of its terms, the resolution of a number of other points of dispute between the parties, and the prevention of further tensions. If the U.S.-China trade dispute re-escalates or relations between the United States and China deteriorate, these conditions could adversely affect our ability to renew license agreements with current licensees as well as license our patent portfolio to currently unlicensed Chinese handset manufacturers. Our ability to renew or conclude new license agreements with such manufacturers could also be affected by economic uncertainty, particularly in the handset market, in China or by our failure to establish a positive reputation and relationships in China. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into any renewal or new license agreements with Chinese handset manufacturers, which, in turn, could cause our long-term business, financial condition and operating results to be materially adversely affected.Setbacks in defending our patent licensing practices could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline and could have an adverse effect on our licensing business.Adverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions relating to our licensing practices, including, but not limited to, findings that we have not complied with our FRAND commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities or that any of our license agreements are void or unenforceable, could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and revenue. Regulatory bodies may assess fines in the event of adverse findings, and as part of court or arbitration proceedings, a judgment could require us to pay damages (including the possibility of treble damages for antitrust claims). In addition, to the extent that legal decisions find patent license agreements to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, that could lead to a decrease in the revenue associated with and cash flow generated by such agreements, and, depending on the damages requested, could lead to the refund of certain payments already made. Such decisions could also cause serious reputational harm. Finally, adverse legal decisions related to our licensing practices could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements, which, in turn, could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline.16Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks resulting from customer concentration.We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees or customers for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2023, Apple, Samsung, Lenovo, and Xiaomi each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Further, because of the limited number of licensees and potential licensees, any opportunistic behavior during license negotiations by a company or companies using our technology could create large exposure for us. In the event that we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements at all or on terms that are favorable to us, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations (for example, due to a credit issue or in connection with a legal dispute or similar proceeding) under their respective license agreements, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, in the event that there is a material decrease in shipments of licensed products by one of our per-unit licensees, our revenues from such licensee could significantly decline and our future revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected. Additionally, there is significant concentration in the wireless communications industry in general, and these trends may continue. For example, in 2022, Samsung, Apple and Xiaomi collectively accounted for approximately 50% of worldwide smartphone shipments, and we anticipate a similar level of concentration in worldwide shipments for 2023 and beyond. Any further concentration or sale within the wireless industry among handset providers may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations. Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our technologies, including in the standards-setting arena. Due to competition, our technologies may not find a viable commercial marketplace or, where applicable, be adopted by the relevant standards. In particular, increasing participation within standards-setting organizations has contributed to greater competition for influence within such organizations and for ultimately setting standards. In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold SEPs, for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain product or products. In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property. To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements due to downward product pricing pressures and competition over patent royalties.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless and consumer electronics industries, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates and/or that such rates should be applied to royalty bases smaller than the selling price of an end product (such as the “smallest salable patent practicing unit”). There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain wireless products, including handsets, and other consumer electronics devices that we believe implement our patented inventions, and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of these devices. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products we aim to license. Demands by certain licensees to reduce royalties due to pricing pressure or the number of patent holders seeking royalties on these technologies could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow.17Table of ContentsOur technologies may not become patented, adopted by wireless or video standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced technology and related solutions.  However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G, 5G, HEVC, VVC and others, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities. There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future. Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and/or adopted by the relevant standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed. Competing technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop. In addition, it is possible that in certain technology areas, such as in the IoT space, the adoption of proprietary systems could compete with or replace standards-based technology. It is also possible in certain technology areas, such as video coding and the IoT, that open source and/or purportedly royalty-free solutions such as AV1, VP-9 and OCF could compete with or replace proprietary standards-based technology. If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented, are not adopted by the relevant standards, or are not adopted by and deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods that we expect, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Some third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. For example, in limited cases, certain of our patents have been held invalid by courts in proceedings initiated by counterparties to our litigation proceedings. We cannot ensure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse findings as to the validity, infringement, enforceability or scope of our patents and/or any successful design-around of our patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise, and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.Our plans to expand our revenue opportunities may not be successful.As part of our business strategy, we regularly seek to expand our revenue opportunities both organically and inorganically. For example, we are currently seeking to expand our licensing activities beyond device-based licensing revenue to certain video and cloud-based service providers. The market for licensing video and cloud-based services is not as developed as device-based licensing programs.  As a result, video and cloud-based service providers do not have a significant volume of comparable agreements against which to compare our offers and may use this as a reason to delay our negotiations with such providers. Additionally, our pricing models may not reflect the demand for our value of our technologies. Accordingly, we may not be able to enter into license agreements with these providers on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. We also seek to expand our business opportunities through targeted acquisitions, research partnerships, joint ventures and licensing platforms. We face intense competition within our industry and otherwise for acquisitions of high-quality businesses, technologies and assets. As such, even if we are able to identify an acquisition target that we would like to acquire, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to consummate any of these inorganic growth opportunities on a reasonable time frame, on terms that are attractive to us or at all, we may not be able to grow our business in line with our expectations and as such, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. Macroeconomic conditions including rising inflation may result in increased costs of operations.A decline in economic conditions, such as a recession, economic downturn or inflationary conditions in the U.S. or elsewhere could adversely affect our business. In particular, inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally. A majority of our revenue is derived from patent license agreements that provide for fixed payments that were negotiated before the recent rise in inflation. An inflationary environment can increase our cost of labor, as well as our other operating costs, without a corresponding increase in our revenue, which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.18Table of ContentsScrutiny by antitrust authorities may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business and/or lead to monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions.Domestic and foreign antitrust authorities regularly review their policies with respect to the use of SEPs, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors and others. Such scrutiny has in the past resulted in enforcement actions against Qualcomm and other licensing companies, and could lead to additional investigations of, or enforcement actions against, us. Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation. Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could also result in monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions or engage in other strategic transactions that could result in significant changes, costs and/or management disruption and that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future acquire companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, and enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may increase our costs, including but not limited to accounting and legal fees, and may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or of any technologies we may acquire.The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, including, among others: successfully integrating new employees, technology and/or products; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures. As a result, we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In addition, we cannot be certain that the integration of acquired companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipate will be realized from such acquisitions. Our plans to integrate and/or expand upon research and development programs and technologies obtained through acquisitions may result in products or technologies that are not adopted by the market, or the market may adopt solutions competitive to our technologies.A portion of our revenue and cash flow is dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A portion of our licensing revenues is dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global, regional and/or country-specific economic conditions and/or public health concerns, country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, demand and buying patterns of end users, which are often driven by replacement and innovation cycles, the service life of products incorporating our technologies, competition for our licensees' products, supply chain disruptions, and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products. In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect, (ii) a decline in the financial condition or market position of any licensee or (iii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global or regional economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies, lower demand or otherwise. It is also difficult to predict the timing, nature and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement (including as a result of the unwillingness of our licensees to compensate us for such past infringement) and new licenses, strategic relationships and the resolution of legal proceedings. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition.  In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for upfront fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees. As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period. Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.19Table of ContentsOur revenue may be affected by the deployment of future-generation wireless standards in place of 3G, 4G and 5G technologies or future-generation video standards, by the timing of such deployment, or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.We own an evolving portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G and 5G cellular technologies and non-cellular technologies including video coding technologies, and our patent portfolio licensing program for future-generation wireless standards or video coding standards may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our current licensing programs. Although we continue to participate in worldwide standards bodies and contribute our intellectual property to future-generation wireless and video coding standards, including standards that will define 5G, our technologies might not be adopted by the relevant standards. In addition, we may not be as successful in the licensing of future-generation products as we have been in licensing products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards, or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such products that is comparable to that which we have historically received on products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards. Furthermore, if there is a delay in the standardization and/or deployment of 5G or future video coding standards, our business and revenue could be negatively impacted.The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designed to operate in accordance with specified technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or anticipated to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement. Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us. We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees, and we may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to us or at all. Further, such extensions, modifications or new license agreements may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to any extension, modification or new license.We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for top talent is substantial. In order to be successful, we must attract, develop, and retain employees. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other technical talent, and these skills are in high demand among our competitors. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees or employment candidates. Further, the increased availability of remote working arrangements, largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and may be able to offer compensation, benefits or work arrangements perceived as more desirable than what we are able to offer. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate our employees, then we may not be able to innovate, execute on our strategy and grow our business as planned. Further, the cost and loss of efficiency related to turnover, particularly at senior levels, may be significant.A potential public health crisis, pandemic or similar event could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.As we saw with the COVID-19 pandemic, any such event can create significant worldwide uncertainty, volatility and economic disruption. The extent to which any potential future public health crises, pandemics or similar events could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations is dependent upon numerous factors, many of which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and uncontrollable. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the duration and scope of the pandemic or other event; (ii) governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic or other event, including travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, work-from-home and shelter-in-place orders and shut-downs; (iii) the impact on our customers, including those that are presently unlicensed, and other business partners; (iv) the impact on U.S. and global economies and the timing and rate of economic recovery; (v) potential adverse effects on the financial markets and access to capital; (vi) potential goodwill or other impairment charges; (vii) increased cybersecurity risks as a result of pervasive remote working conditions; (viii) our ability to effectively carry out our operations due to any adverse impacts on the health and safety of our employees and their families; (ix) the ability of our customers to timely satisfy their payment obligations to us; and (x) fluctuations in global shipments of handsets and consumer electronics devices.20Table of ContentsWe face risks from doing business and maintaining offices in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees, potential licensees and customers are international, and our licensees, potential licensees and customers sell their products to markets throughout the world. In addition, in recent years, we have expanded, and we may continue to expand, our international operations, opening offices in China, France, Belgium and Finland. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties of operating internationally. Our international operations could exacerbate the other risk factors we have identified, and we could be affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; biased enforcement of foreign laws and regulations to promote industrial or economic policies at our expense; retaliatory practices by foreign actors; currency control regulations; export license requirements and restrictions on the use of technology; social, economic and political instability; costly, time consuming and changing regulatory regimes; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments; foreign labor regulations; anti-corruption laws; public health issues; and difficulty in staffing and managing operations remotely. Managing operations and complying with relevant laws and regulations in China may be particularly complex, costly and time-consuming. We also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees, potential licensees and customers do business.In addition, adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies. If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows. In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.Environmental. social and governance (ESG) matters may expose us to reputational risks and legal liability. There is an increasing focus from investors, customers and employees as well as other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. Current and prospective investors are increasingly utilizing ESG data to inform their decisions including investment and voting using a multitude of evolving score and rating frameworks. Additionally public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies' ESG practices continue to grow. If our ESG practices fail to meet the expectations of any of our stakeholders’ evolving standards, our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted. If we do not adapt our strategy or execution quickly enough to meet the evolving expectations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements. Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.Our commercialization, licensing and/or M&A activities could lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could materially adversely affect our business.The legal doctrines of patent exhaustion and implied license may be subject to different judicial interpretations. Our commercialization or licensing of certain technologies and/or our M&A activities could potentially lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could adversely affect our patent licensing program(s) and limit our ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under such program(s), whether through the assumption of license agreements that would result in our patents being captured by such agreements, the acquisition of a business that sells or licenses products that practice our patents, or otherwise. In the event of successful challenges by current or prospective licensees based on these doctrines that result in a material decrease to our patent licensing revenue, our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.21Table of ContentsOur use of open source software could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.Certain of our technology and our suppliers’ technology may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such technology may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for derivative works available or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different from what we customarily use to license our technology. While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that, if we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our technology, discontinue the sale of our technology, release the source code of our proprietary technology to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. There is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.The United States government enacted tax reform in 2017 and continues to provide regulatory guidance related to tax reform provisions, and state authorities continue to provide guidance around the application of tax reform provisions, that in each case, could impact future effective tax rates favorably or unfavorably. The United States government could enact further tax reform legislation, which could adversely impact our tax rate. The international tax environment also continues to change as a result of both coordinated efforts by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, which could ultimately have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses such as ours. Accordingly, our tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof; changes in tax rates; and assessments and any related tax, interest or penalties. If we are deemed to owe additional taxes, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding. Pursuant to the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued. In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Market projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. We utilize these projections in various ways, including key strategic decisions that we regularly make regarding the direction of our business, research and licensing efforts. The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions. Projections on the size of various markets may be inaccurate. In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate. The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our business prospects, operating results and financial condition.22Table of ContentsThe high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers, as well as the cost of new handsets could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is partially dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services and cellular handsets that utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks. Growth in the number of cellular handsets may slow as the number of people worldwide without a cellular handset declines. In addition, if the cost of cellular handsets increases, customers may be less likely to replace their existing devices with new devices. The growth of our business could be adversely affected if either of these events occur.We regularly make strategic decisions about our patent portfolio. Although we seek to focus our operations in areas where we see the potential for growth and to divest assets where we see more limited opportunities, dispositions we decide to undertake may involve risks, and the anticipated benefits of such actions may not be realized.From time to time, we intend to make strategic decisions about our patent portfolio, whether through a formal portfolio review or opportunistic dispositions. Cost savings expectations of any portfolio review are inherently uncertain and, therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve any expected, or any actual cost savings from any such action. Our portfolio review activities may place substantial demands on our management, which could lead to the diversion of management’s attention from other business priorities. We have divested a number of assets, including as part of a recent strategic portfolio rationalization review. Any assets that we divest could turn out to be more valuable than we had anticipated and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic decision about our patent portfolio.It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our per-unit licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue. The standard terms of our per-unit license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be sufficient or effective.Our technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies. Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the marketplace or in the standards setting arena. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful. Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been tested for commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected. In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants. Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.23Table of ContentsOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated. These attempts, which in some cases could be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business or personal information (whether through a breach of our own systems or the breach of a system of a third party that provides services to us) could harm our competitive or negotiating positions, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, compromise our patent enforcement strategies or outlook, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, licensees’, or customers’ confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. Our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules and policies and other obligations regarding data protection.We may be affected by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), the United Kingdom’s GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 impose obligations on companies such as ours regarding the handling of personal data. Additionally, in 2021, China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), which, together China’s existing cyber and data securities regulations, have required and will continue to require significant investment and resources to ensure compliance. Complying with the these and other privacy and cybersecurity regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. If we cannot implement an effective compliance mechanism for cross-border privacy and security matters, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and other penalties. Further, these areas are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent, and creating regulatory uncertainty.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and our Convertible NotesOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict. In particular, the timing of revenue recognition may cause our revenues and earnings to fluctuate, and there is significant judgment in the application of our revenue recognition principles. For example, accounting principles sometimes require us to recognize revenue before the actual amount is certain, which could add to uncertainty in our revenue guidance. The variability and unpredictability of our results of operations or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of industry or financial analysts. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall substantially.Our stock repurchase program may not result in a positive return of capital to shareholders.Our stock repurchase program, including the tender offer that we completed during 2023, may not return value to shareholders as it was designed to do because the market price of the stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver shareholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs. In addition, our Board of Directors could choose to suspend or terminate the stock repurchase program at any time or not to renew the program.Our shareholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.Our current dividend policy contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share on our outstanding common stock. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, the dividend policy and the payment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends in the future. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.24Table of ContentsSecurities analyst coverage or lack of coverage may have a negative impact on our common stock’s market price.The trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities or industry analysts stop their coverage of us or additional securities and industry analysts fail to cover us in the future, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If any analyst or analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If any analyst or analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2023 was approximately $615.2 million. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes may affect the value of the such notes, and the market price of our common stock.In connection with the offerings of the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) and sold warrants to the respective option counterparties. These transactions will be accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon any conversion of the notes. The warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.In addition, the respective option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may modify their respective hedge positions from time to time (including during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions.The potential effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The respective option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that such option counterparties may default under the respective convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the applicable convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.25Table of ContentsProvisions of the 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change under the indentures, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their applicable notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes at a price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock"
2,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2023-02-15,"     RISK FACTORS.We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.12Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our BusinessChallenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements and renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements.  One of the most significant challenges we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions.  As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them.  The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense.  Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time.  Some infringers may act in bad faith, by behaving opportunistically to try to impact license negotiations. Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot ensure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline.  The length of time required to negotiate a license agreement also leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We may also face challenges in renewing our existing license agreements. Many of our license agreements have fixed terms.  Although we endeavor to renew such license agreements prior to their expiration, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before or after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all.  If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all or on terms that are favorable to us, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.In addition, as discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors
, we are currently operating in a challenging regulatory and judicial environment, which may, under certain circumstances, lead to delays in the negotiation of and entry into patent license agreements. Also, as discussed above in these Risk Factors
 and in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K, we are also currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings with potential licensees with whom we do not yet have a patent license agreement, or with whom an existing agreement has expired.  Any such delays in the negotiation or entry into patent license agreements and receipt of the associated revenue stream could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.13Table of ContentsRoyalty rates, or other terms, under our patent license agreements could be subject to determination through arbitration or other third-party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings, and arbitrators, judges or other third-party adjudicators or regulators could determine that our patent royalty rates should be at levels lower than our agreed or historical rates or otherwise make determinations resulting in less favorable terms and conditions under our patent license agreements.Historically, we strive for the terms of our patent license agreements, including our royalty rates, to be reached through arms-length bilateral negotiations with our licensees. We could agree, as we recently did with Samsung pursuant to a binding arbitration agreement, to have royalty rates, and any other disputed terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators). We have no guarantee that the royalty rates or other terms set by arbitrators, courts or other third parties will be favorable to us. It is possible that courts or regulators could decide to set or otherwise determine the FRAND consistency of such terms or the manner in which such terms are determined, including by determining a worldwide royalty rate for our SEPs. Changes to or clarifications of our obligations to be prepared to offer licenses to SEPs on FRAND terms and conditions could require such terms, including our royalty rates, to be determined through third party adjudications. Finally, we and certain of our current and prospective licensees have initiated, and we and others could in the future initiate, legal proceedings or regulatory proceedings requesting third party adjudicators or regulators to set FRAND terms and conditions for a worldwide license to our SEPs, or to determine the FRAND-consistency of current terms and conditions in our patent license agreements. In particular, in 2021, the IP Tribunal of the Supreme People’s Court of the People’s Republic of China (SPC) affirmed its position that in certain SEP licensing disputes, Chinese courts can set worldwide royalty rates. In 2021, Lenovo initiated a proceeding before the Wuhan Intermediate People’s Court to determine a worldwide rate for our 3G, 4G, and 5G SEPs, and in 2022, Oppo initiated a proceeding before the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court to determine a worldwide rate for our 3G, 4G, 5G, 802.11 and HEVC SEPs.  In addition, our FRAND trial before the UK High Court to establish FRAND terms for a worldwide license with Lenovo for our 3G, 4G, and 5G SEPs is pending a decision. To the extent that our patent royalty rates for our patent license agreements are determined through arbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings rather than through bilateral negotiations, because such proceedings are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and there are currently few precedents for such determinations, it is possible that royalty rates may be lower than our comparable rates. This could also have a negative impact on royalties we are able to obtain from future licensees, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.  In addition, to the extent that other terms and conditions for our patent license agreements are determined through such means, such terms and conditions could be less favorable than our historical terms and conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our licensing business. Due to the nature of our business, we could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights and to defend our licensing practices.While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying users and potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import or use products, we have in the past commenced, and may in the future commence, legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we have faced, and could continue to face, counterclaims and other legal proceedings that challenge the essential nature of our patents, or that claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  Litigation adversaries have and may continue to allege that we have not complied with certain commitments to standards-setting organizations and therefore that we are not entitled to the relief that we seek.  For example, Lenovo and other parties have alleged that we have not complied with an obligation to offer a license to a party on FRAND terms and conditions. Parties have also filed, and may in the future file, antitrust claims, unfair competition claims or regulatory complaints on that or other bases, and may seek damages and other relief based on such claims.  Litigation adversaries have also filed against us, and other third parties may in the future file, validity challenges such as inter partes proceedings in the USPTO or the China National Intellectual Property Administration, which can lead to delays of our patent infringement actions as well as potential findings of invalidity.  Such parties may also seek to obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential or are unenforceable.Litigation may be also required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others.  The cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property and of defending our licensing practices has been and may continue to be significant.  As a result, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including in certain jurisdictions the costs and fees of opposing counsel if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.14Table of ContentsPotential patent and litigation reform legislation, potential USPTO and international patent rule changes, potential legislation affecting mechanisms for patent enforcement and available remedies, and potential changes to the intellectual property rights (“IPR”) policies of worldwide standards bodies, as well as rulings in legal proceedings, may affect our investments in research and development and our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and could have a material adverse effect on our licensing business as well as our business as a whole.  Potential changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our research and development investments, patent prosecution costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure, the number of forums in which we can seek to enforce our patents, the remedies that we may be entitled to in patent litigation, and attorneys’ fees or other remedies that could be sought against us, and may require us to reevaluate and modify our research and development activities and patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies. For example, the State Administration for Market Regulation in China requested comments on June 27, 2022 on its draft Provisions on the Prohibition of the Abuse of Intellectual Property Rights to Exclude or Restrict Competition. If adopted as drafted, among other things, the provisions might create an ambiguous standard for a violation of Chinese antitrust laws where a patent holder seeks to enforce its patents “improperly”. The European Commission (EC) has also initiated several processes to review the EU’s IP policies, in particular as they relate to SEPs and FRAND. Most recently there is an ongoing discussion in the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (""ETSI"") to change its rules in order to give a more prominent role to National Administrations in the standards making process and to align voting weights of companies to those of National Administrations. Absence of change could result in ETSI no longer being recognized as an official Standards Developing Organization by the EC. Any change as it relates to these matters could impact our ability to negotiate license agreements on favorable terms or at all, limit our potential legal remedies and materially impact our business. Further, legislation designed to reduce the value of SEPs and alter the U.S. patent system, including legislation designed to reduce the jurisdiction and remedial authority of the USITC, has periodically been introduced in Congress.Any potential changes in the law, the IPR policies of standards bodies or other developments that reduce the number of forums available or the type of relief available in such forums (such as injunctive relief), restrict permissible licensing practices (such as our ability to license on a worldwide portfolio basis) or that otherwise cause us to seek alternative forums (such as arbitration or state court), would make it more difficult for us to enforce our patents, whether in adversarial proceedings or in negotiations.  Because we have historically depended on the availability of certain forms of legal process to enforce our patents and obtain fair and adequate compensation for our investments in research and development and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, developments that undermine our ability to do so could have a negative impact on future licensing efforts.Rulings in our legal proceedings, as well as those of third parties, may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and royalty rate setting and enforcement. For example, in recent years, the USITC and U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have taken some actions that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees, including us. Decisions that occur in the U.S. or in international forums may change the law applicable to various patent law issues, such as, for example, patentability, validity, claim construction, patent exhaustion, patent misuse, permissible licensing practices, available forums, and remedies such as damages and injunctive relief, in ways that are detrimental to the ability of patentees to enforce patents and obtain suitable relief.  Currently, there is an ongoing discussion within the EC regarding potential regulations and policy changes that could determine how and whether a patent is essential to a standard.  The risk of having our patents determined essential based on a single methodology or specific criteria and conditions associated with patent enforcement and licensing as imposed by the EC would affect our strategies as well.  Ongoing uncertainty related to the feasibility and criteria used for this evaluation as well as the cost associated with such essentiality determination could impact the assessment of our SEP portfolio.We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.15Table of ContentsOur plans to renew license agreements with current licensees as well as additional handset manufacturers in China may be adversely affected by a deterioration in United States-China trade and geopolitical relations, our customers facing economic uncertainty there or our failure to establish a positive reputation in China, which could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.Companies headquartered in China currently comprise a substantial portion of the handset manufacturers that remain unlicensed to our patent portfolio.  Our ability to renew license agreements with current licensees in China as well as license new manufacturers is, among other things, affected by the macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as well as our business relationships and perceived reputation in China.  The U.S. and Chinese governments are regularly engaged in various trade discussions, and the U.S. State Department originally issued a travel advisory in January 2019 and reissued this travel advisory on January 11, 2023 along with updates to COVID-19 information which, among other things, advised U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution in China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws. This travel advisory and other security concerns, along with public health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have continued to restrict our ability to conduct in-person negotiations with prospective Chinese licensees, and could continue to do so in the future.  In January 2020, the U.S. and China entered into Phase One of the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China (the ""Phase One Trade Agreement""). The Phase One Trade Agreement takes steps to ease certain trade tensions between the U.S. and China, including tensions involving intellectual property theft and forced intellectual property transfers by China. Although the Phase One Trade Agreement was an encouraging sign of progress in the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, questions still remain as to the enforcement of its terms, the resolution of a number of other points of dispute between the parties, and the prevention of further tensions. If the U.S.-China trade dispute re-escalates or relations between the United States and China deteriorate, these conditions could adversely affect our ability to renew license agreements with current licensees as well as license our patent portfolio to currently unlicensed Chinese handset manufacturers.  Our ability to renew or conclude new license agreements with such manufacturers could also be affected by economic uncertainty, particularly in the handset market, in China or by our failure to establish a positive reputation and relationships in China.  The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into any renewal or new license agreements with Chinese handset manufacturers, which, in turn, could cause our long-term business, financial condition and operating results to be materially adversely affected.Setbacks in defending our patent licensing practices could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline and could have an adverse effect on our licensing business.Adverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions relating to our licensing practices, including, but not limited to, findings that we have not complied with our FRAND commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities or that any of our license agreements are void or unenforceable, could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and revenue.  Regulatory bodies may assess fines in the event of adverse findings, and as part of court or arbitration proceedings, a judgment could require us to pay damages (including the possibility of treble damages for antitrust claims). In addition, to the extent that legal decisions find patent license agreements to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, that could lead to a decrease in the revenue associated with and cash flow generated by such agreements, and, depending on the damages requested, could lead to the refund of certain payments already made.  Finally, adverse legal decisions related to our licensing practices could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements, which, in turn, could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline.16Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks resulting from the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and in the wireless industry generally.We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees or customers for the foreseeable future.  For example, in 2022, Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Further, because of the limited number of licensees and potential licensees, any opportunistic behavior during license negotiations by a company or companies using our technology could create large exposure for us. In the event that we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements at all or on terms that are favorable to us, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations (for example, due to a credit issue or in connection with a legal dispute or similar proceeding) under their respective license agreements, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, in the event that there is a material decrease in shipments of licensed products by one of our per-unit licensees, our revenues from such licensee could significantly decline and our future revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected. Additionally, there is significant concentration among participants in the wireless communications industry, and these trends may continue.  For example, in 2021, Samsung, Apple and Xiaomi collectively accounted for approximately 50% of worldwide smartphone shipments.  Although the rollout of 5G handsets is still in its early stages, we anticipate a similar level of concentration in worldwide shipments of those units as well. Any further concentration or sale within the wireless industry among handset providers and/or original design manufacturers (""ODMs"") may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations.  Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Some third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot ensure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse findings as to the validity, infringement, enforceability or scope of our patents and/or any successful design-around of our patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise, and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements due to downward product pricing pressures and competition over patent royalties.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless and consumer electronics industries, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates and/or that such rates should be applied to royalty bases smaller than the selling price of an end product (such as the “smallest salable patent practicing unit”). There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain wireless products, including handsets, and other consumer electronics devices that we believe implement our patented inventions, and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of these devices. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products we aim to license. Demands by certain licensees to reduce royalties due to pricing pressure or the number of patent holders seeking royalties on these technologies could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow.17Table of ContentsOur technologies may not become patented, adopted by wireless or video standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced technology and related solutions.  However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G, 5G, HEVC, VVC and others, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities.  There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future.  Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and/or adopted by the relevant standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed.  Competing technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop.  In addition, it is possible that in certain technology areas, such as in the IoT space, the adoption of proprietary systems could compete with or replace standards-based technology.  It is also possible in certain technology areas, such as video coding and the IoT, that open source and/or purportedly royalty-free solutions such as AV1, VP-9 and OCF could compete with or replace proprietary standards-based technology.  If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant standards, or are not adopted by and deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods that we expect, or in the case of open source solutions, do not infringe our technology, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.Macroeconomic conditions including rising inflation may result in increased costs of operations.A decline in economic conditions, such as a recession, economic downturn or inflationary conditions in the U.S. or elsewhere could adversely affect our business. In particular, inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally. A majority of our revenue is derived from patent license agreements that provide for fixed payments that were negotiated before the recent rise in inflation. An inflationary environment can increase our cost of labor, as well as our other operating costs, without a corresponding increase in our revenue, which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our technologies, including in the standards-setting arena.  Due to competition, our technologies may not find a viable commercial marketplace or, where applicable, be adopted by the relevant standards.  In particular, increasing participation within standards-setting organizations has contributed to greater competition for influence within such organizations and for ultimately setting standards. In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold SEPs, for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain product or products.  In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property.  To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.Scrutiny by antitrust authorities may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business and/or lead to monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions.Domestic and foreign antitrust authorities regularly review their policies with respect to the use of SEPs, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors and others.  Such scrutiny has in the past resulted in enforcement actions against Qualcomm and other licensing companies, and could lead to additional investigations of, or enforcement actions against, us.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could also result in monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.Our commercialization, licensing and/or M&A activities could lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could materially adversely affect our business.The legal doctrines of patent exhaustion and implied license may be subject to different judicial interpretations.  Our commercialization or licensing of certain technologies and/or our M&A activities could potentially lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could adversely affect our patent licensing program(s) and limit our ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under such program(s), whether through the assumption of license agreements that would result in our patents being captured by such agreements, the acquisition of a business that sells or licenses products that practice our patents, or otherwise. In the event of successful challenges by current or prospective licensees based on these doctrines that result in a material decrease to our patent licensing revenue, our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.18Table of ContentsWe have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions or engage in other strategic transactions that could result in significant changes, costs and/or management disruption and that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future acquire companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, and enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions.  Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may increase our costs, including but not limited to accounting and legal fees, and may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or of any technologies we may acquire.The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, including, among others: successfully integrating new employees, technology and/or products; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.  As a result, we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully.  In addition, we cannot be certain that the integration of acquired companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipate will be realized from such acquisitions.  Our plans to integrate and/or expand upon research and development programs and technologies obtained through acquisitions may result in products or technologies that are not adopted by the market, or the market may adopt solutions competitive to our technologies.A portion of our revenue and cash flow is dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A portion of our licensing revenues is dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global, regional and/or country-specific economic conditions and/or public health concerns, country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, demand and buying patterns of end users, which are often driven by replacement and innovation cycles, the service life of products incorporating our technologies, competition for our licensees' products, supply chain disruptions, and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products.  In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect, (ii) a decline in the financial condition or market position of any licensee or (iii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global or regional economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies, lower demand or otherwise.  It is also difficult to predict the timing, nature and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement (including as a result of the unwillingness of our licensees to compensate us for such past infringement) and new licenses, strategic relationships and the resolution of legal proceedings.  The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition.  In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for upfront fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees.  As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period.  Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.Our revenue may be affected by the deployment of future-generation wireless standards in place of 3G, 4G and 5G technologies or future-generation video standards, by the timing of such deployment, or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.We own an evolving portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G and 5G cellular technologies and non-cellular technologies including video coding technologies, and our patent portfolio licensing program for future-generation wireless standards or video coding standards may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our current licensing programs.  Although we continue to participate in worldwide standards bodies and contribute our intellectual property to future-generation wireless and video coding standards, including standards that will define 5G, our technologies might not be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, we may not be as successful in the licensing of future-generation products as we have been in licensing products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards, or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such products that is comparable to that which we have historically received on products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards.  Furthermore, if there is a delay in the standardization and/or deployment of 5G or future video coding standards, our business and revenue could be negatively impacted.19Table of ContentsThe licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designed to operate in accordance with specified technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or anticipated to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement.  Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us.  We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees, and we may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to us or at all.  Further, such extensions, modifications or new license agreements may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to any extension, modification or new license.Our plans to expand our revenue opportunities may not be successful.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to expand our revenue opportunities through targeted acquisitions, research partnerships, joint ventures and licensing platforms, and the continued development of new technologies, particularly in the video coding and IoT spaces.  We also seek to expand our revenue opportunities beyond device-based licensing revenue to certain video and cloud-based service providers, which may not be successful.  Commercial success depends on many factors, including the demand for the technology, the highly competitive markets for products that utilize our technology, regulatory issues associated with such products, and effective marketing and licensing or product sales. Our technology development and acquisition activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, if at all, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing.  In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology than we expect, and/or our offerings may require robust ecosystems of customers and service providers that may fail to materialize.  Technology markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, infrastructure improvements.  Additionally, investing in technology development is costly and may require structural changes to the organization that could require additional costs, including without limitation legal and accounting fees.  Furthermore, delays or failures to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate technology development efforts and secure support for our technologies or delays or failures to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows, or decrease our ability to remain competitive. In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for top talent is substantial. In order to be successful, we must attract, develop, and retain employees. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other technical talent, and these skills are in high demand among our competitors. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees or employment candidates. Further, the increased availability of remote working arrangements, largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and may be able to offer compensation, benefits or work arrangements perceived as more desirable than what we are able to offer. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate our employees, then we may not be able to innovate, execute on our strategy and grow our business as planned.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other potential future public health crises, pandemics or similar events will adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant worldwide uncertainty, volatility and economic disruption. The extent to which COVID-19 and any other potential future public health crises, pandemics or similar events could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations is dependent upon numerous factors, many of which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and uncontrollable. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the duration and scope of the pandemic; (ii) governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic or other event, including travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, work-from-home and shelter-in-place orders and shut-downs; (iii) the impact on our customers, including those that are presently unlicensed, and other business partners; (iv) the impact on U.S. and global economies and the timing and rate of economic recovery; (v) potential adverse effects on the financial markets and access to capital; (vi) potential goodwill or other impairment charges; (vii) increased cybersecurity risks as a result of pervasive remote working conditions; (viii) our ability to effectively carry out our operations due to any adverse impacts on the health and safety of our employees and their families; (ix) the ability of our customers to timely satisfy their payment obligations to us; and (x) fluctuations in global shipments of handsets and consumer electronics devices.20Table of ContentsMany of our employees have the flexibility to work remotely on at least a part-time basis, which could impair our ability to maintain our collaborative and innovative culture, and may cause disruptions among our employees, including decreases in productivity, challenges in communications between on-site and off-site employees and, potentially, employee dissatisfaction and attrition. When our employees do work in our offices, they may be exposed to COVID-19 or other illnesses. Any of these factors could adversely impact our business.We face risks from doing business and maintaining offices in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees, potential licensees and customers are international, and our licensees, potential licensees and customers sell their products to markets throughout the world.  In addition, in recent years, we have expanded, and we may continue to expand, our international operations, opening offices in France, Belgium and Finland.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties of operating internationally and could be affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; biased enforcement of foreign laws and regulations to promote industrial or economic policies at our expense; retaliatory practices by foreign actors; currency control regulations; export license requirements and restrictions on the use of technology; social, economic and political instability; costly, time consuming and changing regulatory regimes; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments; foreign labor regulations; anti-corruption laws; public health issues; and difficulty in staffing and managing operations remotely.  We also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees, potential licensees and customers do business.In addition, adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies.  If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.  In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.Environmental. social and governance (ESG) matters may expose us to reputational risks and legal liability. There is an increasing focus from investors, customers and employees as well as other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. Current and prospective investors are increasingly utilizing ESG data to inform their decisions including investment and voting using a multitude of evolving score and rating frameworks. Additionally public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies' ESG practices continue to grow. If our ESG practices fail to meet the expectations of any of our stakeholders’ evolving standards, our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted. If we do not adapt our strategy or execution quickly enough to meet the evolving expectations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements.  Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable.  The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.21Table of ContentsOur use of open source software could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.Certain of our technology and our suppliers’ technology may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions.  Licensing of such technology may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software.  For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for derivative works available or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different from what we customarily use to license our technology.  While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that, if we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our technology, discontinue the sale of our technology, release the source code of our proprietary technology to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  There is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.The United States government enacted tax reform in 2017 and continues to provide regulatory guidance related to tax reform provisions, and state authorities continue to provide guidance around the application of tax reform provisions, that in each case could impact future effective tax rates favorably or unfavorably.  The United States government could enact further tax reform legislation, which could adversely impact our tax rate. The international tax environment also continues to change as a result of both coordinated efforts by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, which could ultimately have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses such as ours. Accordingly, our tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof; changes in tax rates; and assessments and any related tax, interest or penalties. If we are deemed to owe additional taxes, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.  We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding.  Pursuant to the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers, as well as the cost of new handsets could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is partially dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services and cellular handsets that utilize our technology.  In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies.  The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services.  Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers.  The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks.  Growth in the number of cellular handsets may slow as the number of people worldwide without a cellular handset declines.  In addition, if the cost of cellular handsets increases, customers may be less likely to replace their existing devices with new devices.  The growth of our business could be adversely affected if either of these events occur.22Table of ContentsMarket projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.  The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions.  In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate.  The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our per-unit licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue. The standard terms of our per-unit license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis.  Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute.  From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end.Our technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies.  Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the marketplace or in the standards setting arena.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful.  Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected.  In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants.  Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated.  These attempts, which in some cases could be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others.  We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business or personal information (whether through a breach of our own systems or the breach of a system of a third party that provides services to us) could harm our competitive or negotiating positions, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, compromise our patent enforcement strategies or outlook, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.  In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, licensees’, or customers’ confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. 23Table of ContentsOur business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules and policies and other obligations regarding data protection.We may be affected by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.  For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), the United Kingdom’s GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 impose obligations on companies such as ours regarding the handling of personal data. Additionally, in 2021, China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), which, together China’s existing cyber and data securities regulations, have required and will continue to require significant investment and resources to ensure compliance.  Complying with the these and other privacy and cybersecurity regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices.  If we cannot implement an effective compliance mechanism for cross-border privacy and security matters, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and other penalties. Further, these areas are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent, and creating regulatory uncertainty.We regularly make strategic decisions about our patent portfolio. Although we seek to focus our operations in areas where we see the potential for growth and to divest assets where we see more limited opportunities, dispositions we decide to undertake may involve risks, and the anticipated benefits of such actions may not be realized.From time to time, we intend to make strategic decisions about our patent portfolio, whether through a formal portfolio review or opportunistic dispositions. Cost savings expectations of any portfolio review are inherently uncertain and, therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve any expected, or any actual cost savings from any such action. Our portfolio review activities may place substantial demands on our management, which could lead to the diversion of management’s attention from other business priorities. We have divested a number of assets, including as part of a recent strategic portfolio rationalization review. Any assets that we divest could turn out to be more valuable than we had anticipated and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic decision about our patent portfolio.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and our Convertible NotesOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict. In particular, the timing of revenue recognition may cause our revenues and earnings to fluctuate, and there is significant judgment in the application of our revenue recognition principles. For example, accounting principles may require us to recognize revenue before the actual amount is certain, which could add to uncertainty in our revenue guidance.  The variability and unpredictability of our results of operations or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of industry or financial analysts. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall substantially.Our stock repurchase program may not result in a positive return of capital to shareholders.Our stock repurchase program, including the tender offer that we initiated during first quarter 2023, may not return value to shareholders as it was designed to do because the market price of the stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock.  Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver shareholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.  In addition, our Board of Directors could choose to suspend or terminate the stock repurchase program at any time or not to renew the program.Our shareholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.Our current dividend policy contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share on our outstanding common stock.  We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy.  However, the dividend policy and the payment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.  Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends in the future.  Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.24Table of ContentsSecurities analyst coverage or lack of coverage may have a negative impact on our common stock’s market price.The trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities or industry analysts stop their coverage of us or additional securities and industry analysts fail to cover us in the future, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If any analyst or analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If any analyst or analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $616.8 million. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes.In addition, as more fully described in Note 9 “Obligations” within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we made an irrevocable election to “Net Share Settle” our obligations under the 2024 Notes, which requires us to pay the outstanding principal amount due under the 2024 Notes in cash.  Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the 2024 Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes and to fund other liquidity needs.  If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes or 2027 Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other currently existing or future outstanding indebtedness.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the  2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes may affect the value of the such notes, and the market price of our common stock.In connection with the offerings of the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) and sold warrants to the respective option counterparties.  These transactions will be accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity.  The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon any conversion of the notes.  The warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.In addition, the respective option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may modify their respective hedge positions from time to time (including during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions.The potential effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.25Table of ContentsWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The respective option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that such option counterparties may default under the respective convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral.  If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the applicable convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock.  In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock.  We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.Provisions of the 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change under the indentures, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their applicable notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes at a price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions.  These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock"
6,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2022-02-17,"     RISK FACTORS. We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.Risks Related to Our BusinessChallenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements and renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements.  One of the most significant challenges we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions.  As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them.  The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense.  Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time.  Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot ensure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline.  The length of time required to negotiate a license agreement also leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We may also face challenges in renewing our existing license agreements. Many of our license agreements have fixed terms.  Although we endeavor to renew such license agreements prior to their expiration, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before or after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all.  If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In particular, two of our largest patent license agreements, those with Apple and Samsung, expire during the second half of 2022. We may not be able to renew these agreements promptly or at all, or on terms that are favorable to us. Any such failure would materially harm our revenues, cash flows and overall business and could harm our other licensing efforts. In addition, as discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors
, we are currently operating in a challenging regulatory and judicial environment, which may, under certain circumstances, lead to delays in the negotiation of and entry into patent license agreements. Also, as discussed above in these Risk Factors
 and in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K, we are also currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings with potential licensees with whom we do not yet have a patent license agreement, or with whom an existing agreement has expired.  Any such delays in the negotiation or entry into patent license agreements and receipt of the associated revenue stream could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.13Table of ContentsRoyalty rates, or other terms, under our patent license agreements could be subject to determination through arbitration or other third-party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings, and arbitrators, judges or other third-party adjudicators or regulators could determine that our patent royalty rates should be at levels lower than our agreed or historical rates or otherwise make determinations resulting in less favorable terms and conditions under our patent license agreements.Historically, we strive for the terms of our patent license agreements, including our royalty rates, to be reached through arms-length bilateral negotiations with our licensees. We could agree, as we did with Huawei pursuant to our December 2013 settlement agreement, to have royalty rates, or other terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators) and it is also possible that courts or regulators could decide to set or otherwise determine the FRAND consistency of such terms or the manner in which such terms are determined, including by determining a worldwide royalty rate for our SEPs. Changes to or clarifications of our obligations to be prepared to offer licenses to SEPs on FRAND terms and conditions could require such terms, including our royalty rates, to be determined through third party adjudications. Finally, we and certain of our current and prospective licensees have initiated, and we and others could in the future initiate, legal proceedings or regulatory proceedings requesting third party adjudicators or regulators to set FRAND terms and conditions for, or determine the FRAND-consistency of current terms and conditions in, our patent license agreements, and which could result in such third party adjudicators or regulators determining a worldwide royalty rate for our SEPs. In particular, in 2021, the IP Tribunal of the Supreme People’s Court of the People’s Republic of China (SPC) affirmed its position that in certain SEP licensing disputes, Chinese courts can set worldwide royalty rates, and Lenovo recently initiated a proceeding before the Wuhan Intermediate People’s Court to determine a worldwide rate for our 3G, 4G, and 5G SEPs. In addition, our FRAND trial before the UK High Court to establish FRAND terms for a worldwide license with Lenovo for our 3G, 4G, and 5G SEPs recently completed and is pending a decision. To the extent that our patent royalty rates for our patent license agreements are determined through arbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings rather than through bilateral negotiations, because such proceedings are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and there are currently few precedents for such determinations, it is possible that royalty rates may be lower than our comparable rates, and this could also have a negative impact on royalties we are able to obtain from future licensees, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.  In addition, to the extent that other terms and conditions for our patent license agreements are determined through such means, such terms and conditions could be less favorable than our historical terms and conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our licensing business. Due to the nature of our business, we could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights and to defend our licensing practices.While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying users and potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import or use products, we have in the past commenced, and may in the future, commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we have faced, and could continue to face, counterclaims and other legal proceedings that challenge the essential nature of our patents, or that claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  Litigation adversaries have and may continue to allege that we have not complied with certain commitments to standards-setting organizations and therefore that we are not entitled to the relief that we seek.  For example, Lenovo has alleged, and other parties may allege, that we have not complied with an obligation to offer a license to a party on FRAND terms and conditions, and may also file antitrust claims, unfair competition claims or regulatory complaints on that or other bases, and may seek damages and other relief based on such claims.  Litigation adversaries have also filed against us, and other third parties may in the future file, validity challenges such as inter partes proceedings in the USPTO or the China National Intellectual Property Administration, which can lead to delays of our patent infringement actions as well as potential findings of invalidity.  Such parties may also seek to obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential or are unenforceable.Litigation may be also required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others.  The cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property and of defending our licensing practices has been and may continue to be significant.  As a result, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including in certain jurisdictions the costs and fees of opposing counsel if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.14Table of ContentsPotential patent and litigation reform legislation, potential USPTO and international patent rule changes, potential legislation affecting mechanisms for patent enforcement and available remedies, and potential changes to the intellectual property rights (“IPR”) policies of worldwide standards bodies, as well as rulings in legal proceedings, may affect our investments in research and development and our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and could have a material adverse effect on our licensing business as well as our business as a whole.  Potential changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our research and development investments, patent prosecution costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure, the number of forums in which we can seek to enforce our patents, the remedies that we may be entitled to in patent litigation, and attorneys’ fees or other remedies that could be sought against us, and may require us to reevaluate and modify our research and development activities and patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies.  For example, President Biden issued an executive order which, among other things, proposed considering changes to the USPTO, DOJ and National Institute of Standards and Technology’s joint policy statement on remedies for SEPs subject to FRAND commitments. The European Commission has also initiated a process to review the EU’s IP policies, in particular as they relate to SEPs and FRAND. Any change as it relates to these matters could impact our ability to negotiate license agreements on favorable terms or at all, limit our potential legal remedies and materially impact our business. Further, legislation designed to reduce the jurisdiction and remedial authority of the USITC has periodically been introduced in Congress.Any potential changes in the law, the IPR policies of standards bodies or other developments that reduce the number of forums available or the type of relief available in such forums (such as injunctive relief), restrict permissible licensing practices (such as our ability to license on a worldwide portfolio basis) or that otherwise cause us to seek alternative forums (such as arbitration or state court), would make it more difficult for us to enforce our patents, whether in adversarial proceedings or in negotiations.  Because we have historically depended on the availability of certain forms of legal process to enforce our patents and obtain fair and adequate compensation for our investments in research and development and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, developments that undermine our ability to do so could have a negative impact on future licensing efforts.Rulings in our legal proceedings as well as those of third parties may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement.  For example, in recent years, the USITC and U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have taken some actions that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees, including us.  Decisions that occur in the U.S. or in international forums may change the law applicable to various patent law issues, such as, for example, patentability, validity, claim construction, patent exhaustion, patent misuse, permissible licensing practices, available forums, and remedies such as damages and injunctive relief, in ways that are detrimental to the ability of patentees to enforce patents and obtain suitable relief.We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.15Table of ContentsOur plans to license additional handset manufacturers in China may be adversely affected by a deterioration in United States-China trade and geopolitical relations, our customers facing economic uncertainty there or our failure to establish a positive reputation in China, which could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.Companies headquartered in China currently comprise a substantial portion of the handset manufacturers that remain unlicensed to our patent portfolio.  Our ability to license such manufacturers is, among other things, affected by the macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as well as our business relationships and perceived reputation in China.  The U.S. and Chinese governments are currently engaged in trade negotiations, and the U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory in January 2019 that advised U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution in China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws. This travel advisory and other security concerns, along with public health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have restricted our ability to conduct in-person negotiations with prospective Chinese licensees in the past, and could continue to do so in the future.  In January 2020, the U.S. and China entered into Phase One of the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China (the ""Phase One Trade Agreement""). The Phase One Trade Agreement takes steps to ease certain trade tensions between the U.S. and China, including tensions involving intellectual property theft and forced intellectual property transfers by China. Although the Phase One Trade Agreement was an encouraging sign of progress in the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, questions still remain as to the enforcement of its terms, the resolution of a number of other points of dispute between the parties, and the prevention of further tensions. If the U.S.-China trade dispute re-escalates or relations between the United States and China deteriorate, these conditions could adversely affect our ability to license our patent portfolio to Chinese handset manufacturers. Our ability to license such manufacturers could also be affected by economic uncertainty, particularly in the handset market, in China or by our failure to establish a positive reputation and relationships in China.  The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements with Chinese handset manufacturers, which, in turn, could cause our long-term business, financial condition and operating results to be materially adversely affected.Setbacks in defending our patent licensing practices could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline and could have an adverse effect on our licensing business.Adverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions relating to our licensing practices, including, but not limited to, findings that we have not complied with our FRAND commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities or that any of our license agreements are void or unenforceable, could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and revenue.  Regulatory bodies may assess fines in the event of adverse findings, and as part of court or arbitration proceedings, a judgment could require us to pay damages (including the possibility of treble damages for antitrust claims). In addition, to the extent that legal decisions find patent license agreements to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, that could lead to a decrease in the revenue associated with and cash flow generated by such agreements, and, depending on the damages requested, could lead to the refund of certain payments already made.  Finally, adverse legal decisions related to our licensing practices could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements, which, in turn, could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Some third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot ensure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity, infringement, enforceability or scope of our patents and/or any successful design-around of our patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise, and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.16Table of ContentsRoyalty rates could decrease for future license agreements due to downward product pricing pressures and competition over patent royalties.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless and consumer electronics industries, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates and/or that such rates should be applied to royalty bases smaller than the selling price of an end product (such as the “smallest salable patent practicing unit”). There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain wireless products, including handsets, and other consumer electronics devices that we believe implement our patented inventions, and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of these devices. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products we aim to license. Demands by certain licensees to reduce royalties due to pricing pressure or the number of patent holders seeking royalties on these technologies could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow.Risks related to the implementation of our strategic review.              As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, during second quarter 2021, we began the process of a strategic review in order to increase focus on core technologies and markets. Related to this review, during second quarter 2021, we commenced the process of a collective economic layoff in which we proposed a reduction in force of 66 positions in our research and innovation unit, the majority of whom are based in France. The process to undertake this collective economic layoff is governed by French labor law and could take more time and be more costly than anticipated. As part of our further restructuring efforts, in October 2021, we expanded the scope of our reduction in force to include general and administrative functions largely in the U.S. These restructuring initiatives have placed substantial demands on our management, which could lead to the diversion of management’s attention from other business priorities, and we expect these demands will continue. These initiatives could also lead to unanticipated work stoppages, low employee morale, decreased productivity, and a failure to deliver under existing commitments to third parties for research services, which could harm our business. As a result of these or any other factors, we could fail to realize the anticipated benefits associated with the strategic review, which could in turn materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.Our technologies may not become patented, adopted by wireless or video standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced technology and related solutions.  However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G, 5G, HEVC, VVC and others, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities.  There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future.  Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and adopted by the relevant standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed.  Competing technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop.  In addition, it is possible that in certain technology areas, such as in the IoT space, the adoption of proprietary systems could compete with or replace standards-based technology.  It is also possible in certain technology areas, such as video coding and the IoT, that open source and/or purportedly royalty-free solutions such as AV1, VP-9 and OCF could compete with or replace proprietary standards-based technology.  If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant standards, or are not adopted by and deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods that we expect, or in the case of open source solutions, do not infringe our technology, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our technologies, including in the standards-setting arena.  Due to competition, our technologies may not find a viable commercial marketplace or, where applicable, be adopted by the relevant standards.  In particular, increasing participation within standards-setting organizations has contributed to greater competition for influence within such organizations and for ultimately setting standards. In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold SEPs, for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain product or products.  In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property.  To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.17Table of ContentsScrutiny by antitrust authorities may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business and/or lead to monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions.Domestic and foreign antitrust authorities regularly review their policies with respect to the use of SEPs, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors and others.  Such scrutiny has in the past resulted in enforcement actions against Qualcomm and other licensing companies, and could lead to additional investigations of, or enforcement actions against, us.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could also result in monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.Our commercialization, licensing and/or M&A activities could lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could materially adversely affect our business.The legal doctrines of patent exhaustion and implied license may be subject to different judicial interpretations.  Our commercialization or licensing of certain technologies and/or our M&A activities could potentially lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could adversely affect our patent licensing program(s) and limit our ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under such program(s), whether through the assumption of license agreements that would result in our patents being captured by such agreements, the acquisition of a business that sells or licenses products that practice our patents, or otherwise. In the event of successful challenges by current or prospective licensees based on these doctrines that result in a material decrease to our patent licensing revenue, our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.We have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions or engage in other strategic transactions that could result in significant changes, costs and/or management disruption and that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future acquire companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, and enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions.  Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may increase our costs, including but not limited to accounting and legal fees, and may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or of any technologies we may acquire.The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, including, among others: successfully integrating new employees, technology and/or products; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.  As a result, we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully.  In addition, we cannot be certain that the integration of acquired companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipate will be realized from such acquisitions.  Our plans to integrate and/or expand upon research and development programs and technologies obtained through acquisitions may result in products or technologies that are not adopted by the market, or the market may adopt solutions competitive to our technologies.  Our revenues are derived primarily from a limited number of licensees or customers.We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees or customers for the foreseeable future.  For example, in 2021, Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, and Huawei each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. In the event that we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements upon expiration, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations (for example, due to a credit issue or in connection with a legal dispute or similar proceeding) under their respective license agreements, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, in the event that there is a material decrease in shipments of licensed products by one of our per-unit licensees, our revenues from such licensee could significantly decline and our future revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected.18Table of ContentsA portion of our revenue and cash flow is dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A portion of our licensing revenues is dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global, regional and/or country-specific economic conditions and/or public health concerns (e.g., the current coronavirus pandemic), country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, demand and buying patterns of end users, which are often driven by replacement and innovation cycles, the service life of products incorporating our technologies, competition for our licensees' products, supply chain disruptions, and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products.  In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect, (ii) a decline in the financial condition or market position of any licensee or (iii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global or regional economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies, lower demand or otherwise.  It is also difficult to predict the timing, nature and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement (including as a result of the unwillingness of our licensees to compensate us for such past infringement) and new licenses, strategic relationships and the resolution of legal proceedings.  The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition.  In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for upfront fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees.  As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period.  Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.Our revenue may be affected by the deployment of future-generation wireless standards in place of 3G, 4G and 5G technologies or future-generation video standards, by the timing of such deployment, or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.We own an evolving portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G and 5G cellular technologies and non-cellular technologies including video coding technologies, and our patent portfolio licensing program for future-generation wireless standards or video coding standards may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our current licensing programs.  Although we continue to participate in worldwide standards bodies and contribute our intellectual property to future-generation wireless and video coding standards, including standards that will define 5G, our technologies might not be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, we may not be as successful in the licensing of future-generation products as we have been in licensing products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards, or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such products that is comparable to that which we have historically received on products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards.  Furthermore, if there is a delay in the standardization and/or deployment of 5G or future video coding standards, our business and revenue could be negatively impacted.The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designed to operate in accordance with specified technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or anticipated to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement.  Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us.  We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees, and we may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to us or at all.  Further, such extensions, modifications or new license agreements may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to any extension, modification or new license.19Table of ContentsOur plans to expand our revenue opportunities through strategic partnerships and acquiring and/or developing new technology with commercial applicability may not be successful.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to expand our revenue opportunities through targeted acquisitions, research partnerships, joint ventures and licensing platforms, and the continued development of new technologies, particularly in the video coding and IoT spaces.  Commercial success depends on many factors, including the demand for the technology, the highly competitive markets for products that utilize our technology, regulatory issues associated with such products, and effective marketing and licensing or product sales. Our technology development and acquisition activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, if at all, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing.  In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology than we expect, and/or our offerings may require robust ecosystems of customers and service providers that may fail to materialize.  Technology markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, infrastructure improvements.  Additionally, investing in technology development is costly and may require structural changes to the organization that could require additional costs, including without limitation legal and accounting fees.  Furthermore, delays or failures to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate technology development efforts and secure support for our technologies or delays or failures to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows, or decrease our ability to remain competitive. In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for top talent is substantial and increasing. In order to be successful, we must attract, develop, and retain employees. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other technical talent, and these skills are in high demand among our competitors. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees or employment candidates. Further, the increased availability of remote working arrangements, largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and may be able to offer compensation, benefits or work arrangements perceived as more desirable than what we are able to offer. If we are unable to recruit, retain, and motivate our employees, then we may not be able to innovate, execute on our strategy and grow our business as planned.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other potential future public health crises, pandemics or similar events will adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant worldwide uncertainty, volatility and economic disruption. The extent to which COVID-19 and any other potential future public health crises, pandemics or similar events will adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations is dependent upon numerous factors, many of which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and uncontrollable. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the duration and scope of the pandemic; (ii) governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic or other event, including travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, work-from-home and shelter-in-place orders and shut-downs; (iii) the impact on our customers, including those that are presently unlicensed, and other business partners; (iv) the impact on U.S. and global economies and the timing and rate of economic recovery; (v) potential adverse effects on the financial markets and access to capital; (vi) potential goodwill or other impairment charges; (vii) increased cybersecurity risks as a result of pervasive remote working conditions; (viii) our ability to effectively carry out our operations due to any adverse impacts on the health and safety of our employees and their families; (ix) the ability of our customers to timely satisfy their payment obligations to us; and (x) fluctuations in global shipments of handsets and consumer electronics devices. Furthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our employees have been required to work from home for an extended period of time. The significant increase in remote working could exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased risk of cybersecurity events, improper dissemination of personal or confidential information and breakdowns in internal controls and processes.Further, as our employees return to work in our physical locations, they may be exposed to COVID-19, and there can be no assurances that the protective measures that we have taken will be sufficient to protect our employees. As part of our return-to-work plan, many of our employees will have the flexibility to work remotely on at least a part-time basis for the foreseeable future, which could impair our ability to maintain our collaborative and innovative culture, and may cause disruptions among our employees, including decreases in productivity, challenges in communications between on-site and off-site employees and, potentially, employee dissatisfaction and attrition. Any of these factors could adversely impact our business.20Table of ContentsWe face risks from doing business and maintaining offices in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees, potential licensees and customers are international, and our licensees, potential licensees and customers sell their products to markets throughout the world.  In addition, in recent years, we have expanded, and we may continue to expand, our international operations, opening offices in France, Belgium and Finland.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties of operating internationally and could be affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; biased enforcement of foreign laws and regulations to promote industrial or economic policies at our expense; retaliatory practices by foreign actors; currency control regulations; export license requirements and restrictions on the use of technology; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments; foreign labor regulations; anti-corruption laws; public health issues; and difficulty in staffing and managing operations remotely.  We also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees, potential licensees and customers do business.In addition, adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies.  If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.  In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements.  Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable.  The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.Concentration and consolidation in the wireless communications industry could adversely affect our business.There is some concentration among participants in the wireless communications industry, and the industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses, and these trends may continue.  For example, in 2021, Samsung, Apple and Xiaomi collectively accounted for approximately 50% of worldwide smartphone shipments.  Although the rollout of 5G handsets is still in its early stages, we anticipate a similar level of concentration in worldwide shipments of those units as well. Any further concentration or sale within the wireless industry among handset providers and/or original design manufacturers (""ODMs"") may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations.  We may also face a reduction in the number of licensing opportunities or existing royalty obligations as a result of government-imposed bans or other restrictions on the importation, manufacture and/or sale of cellular handsets by certain companies.  In addition, acquisitions of, or consolidation among, ODMs could cause handset providers who outsource manufacturing to make supply chain changes, which in turn could result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations (for example, if manufacturing is moved from an ODM with which we have a patent license agreement to an ODM with which we do not).  Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.21Table of ContentsOur use of open source software could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.Certain of our technology and our suppliers’ technology may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions.  Licensing of such technology may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software.  For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for derivative works available or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different from what we customarily use to license our technology.  While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that, if we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our technology, discontinue the sale of our technology, release the source code of our proprietary technology to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  There is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.The United States government enacted tax reform in 2017 and continues to provide regulatory guidance related to tax reform provisions, and state authorities continue to provide guidance around the application of tax reform provisions, that in each case could impact future effective tax rates favorably or unfavorably. The United States government could enact further tax reform legislation, which could adversely impact our tax rate. The international tax environment also continues to change as a result of both coordinated efforts by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, which could ultimately have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses such as ours. Accordingly, our tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof; changes in tax rates; and assessments and any related tax, interest or penalties. If we are deemed to owe additional taxes, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.  We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding.  Pursuant to the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued.  As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers, as well as the cost of new handsets could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is partially dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services and cellular handsets that utilize our technology.  In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies.  The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services.  Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers.  The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks.  Growth in the number of cellular handsets may slow as the number of people worldwide without a cellular handset declines.  In addition, if the cost of cellular handsets increases, customers may be less likely to replace their existing devices with new devices.  The growth of our business could be adversely affected if either of these events occur.22Table of ContentsMarket projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.  The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions.  In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate.  The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our per-unit licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue. The standard terms of our per-unit license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis.  Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute.  From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end.Our technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies.  Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the marketplace or in the standards setting arena.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful.  Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected.  In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants.  Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated.  These attempts, which in some cases could be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others.  We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business or personal information (whether through a breach of our own systems or the breach of a system of a third party that provides services to us) could harm our competitive or negotiating positions, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, compromise our patent enforcement strategies or outlook, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.  In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, licensees’, or customers’ confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. 23Table of ContentsOur business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules and policies and other obligations regarding data protection.We may be affected by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.  For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") adopted by the European Commission became effective in May 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA"") adopted by the California State Legislature became effective in January 2020, and China adopted a new cybersecurity law as of June 2017.  Complying with the GDPR, the CCPA and other existing and emerging and changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices.  Non-compliance could result in monetary penalties or significant legal liability.We regularly make strategic decisions about our patent portfolio. Although we seek to focus our operations in areas where we see the potential for growth and to divest assets where we see more limited opportunities, dispositions we decide to undertake may involve risks, and the anticipated benefits of such actions may not be realized.From time to time, we intend to make strategic decisions about our patent portfolio, whether through a formal portfolio review or opportunistic dispositions. Cost savings expectations of any portfolio review are inherently uncertain and, therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve any expected, or any actual cost savings from any such action. Our portfolio review activities may place substantial demands on our management, which could lead to the diversion of management’s attention from other business priorities. We have divested a number of assets, including as part of a recent strategic portfolio rationalization review. Any assets that we divest could turn out to be more valuable than we had anticipated and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic decision about our patent portfolio.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and our Convertible NotesOur shareholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.Our current dividend policy contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share on our outstanding common stock.  We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy.  However, the dividend policy and the payment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.  Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends in the future.  Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.Securities analyst coverage or lack of coverage may have a negative impact on our common stock’s market price.              The trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities or industry analysts stop their coverage of us or additional securities and industry analysts fail to cover us in the future, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If any analyst or analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst or analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.24Table of ContentsOur approved stock repurchase program may not result in a positive return of capital to shareholders.Our Board-approved stock repurchase program may not return value to shareholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock.  Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver shareholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.  In addition, our Board of Directors could choose to suspend or terminate the stock repurchase program at any time or not to renew the program.Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $427.1 million.  This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes.In addition, as more fully described in Note 9 “Obligations” within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we made an irrevocable election to “Net Share Settle” our obligations under the 2024 Notes, which requires us to pay the outstanding principal amount due under the 2024 Notes in cash.  Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the 2024 Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes and to fund other liquidity needs.  If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the 2024 Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other currently existing or future outstanding indebtedness.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the  2024 Notes may affect the value of the 2024 Notes, respectively, and the market price of our common stock.In connection with each offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) and sold warrants to the respective option counterparties.  These transactions will be accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity.  The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes.  The warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.In addition, the respective option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may modify their respective hedge positions from time to time (including during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2024 Notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions.The potential effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.25Table of ContentsWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The respective option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that such option counterparties may default under the respective convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral.  If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the applicable convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock.  In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock.  We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.Provisions of the 2024 Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the 2024 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change under the respective 2024 Notes, holders of the 2024 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their applicable 2024 Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such 2024 Notes at a price of 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions.  These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock"
4,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2021-02-18,"     RISK FACTORS. We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.Risks Related to Our BusinessRoyalty rates, or other terms, under our patent license agreements could be subject to determination through arbitration or other third-party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings, and arbitrators, judges or other third-party adjudicators or regulators could determine that our patent royalty rates should be at levels lower than our agreed or historical rates or otherwise make determinations resulting in less favorable terms and conditions under our patent license agreements.Historically, we strive for the terms of our patent license agreements, including our royalty rates, to be reached through arms-length bilateral negotiations with our licensees. We could agree, as we did with Huawei pursuant to our December 2013 settlement agreement, to have royalty rates, or other terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators) and it is also possible that courts or regulators could decide to set or otherwise determine the FRAND consistency of such terms or the manner in which such terms are determined, including by determining a worldwide royalty rate for our SEPs. Changes to or clarifications of our obligations to be prepared to offer licenses to SEPs on FRAND terms and conditions could require such terms, including our royalty rates, to be determined through third party adjudications. Finally, we and certain of our current and prospective licensees have initiated, and we and others could in the future initiate, legal proceedings or regulatory proceedings requesting third party adjudicators or regulators to set FRAND terms and conditions for, or determine the FRAND-consistency of current terms and conditions in, our patent license agreements, and which could result in such third party adjudicators or regulators determining a worldwide royalty rate for our SEPs, such as the proceeding Xiaomi initiated before the Wuhan Intermediate People’s Court to determine a worldwide rate for our 3G and 4G SEPs. To the extent that our patent royalty rates for our patent license agreements are determined through arbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings rather than through bilateral negotiations, because such proceedings are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and there are currently few precedents for such determinations, it is possible that royalty rates may be lower than our historical rates, and this could also have a negative impact on royalties we are able to obtain from future licensees, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow. In addition, to the extent that other terms and conditions for our patent license agreements are determined through such means, such terms and conditions could be less favorable than our historical terms and conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our licensing business. Due to the nature of our business, we could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights and to defend our licensing practices.While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying users and potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import or use products, we have in the past commenced, and may in the future, commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we have faced, and could continue to face, counterclaims and other legal proceedings that challenge the essential nature of our patents, or that claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  Litigation adversaries have and may continue allege that we have not complied with certain commitments to standards-setting organizations and therefore that we are not entitled to the relief that we seek.  For example, Lenovo has alleged, and other parties may allege, that we have not complied with an obligation to offer a license to a party on FRAND terms and conditions, and may also file antitrust claims, unfair competition claims or regulatory complaints on that or other bases, and may seek damages and other relief based on such claims.  Litigation adversaries have also filed against us, and other third parties may in the future file, validity challenges such as inter partes proceedings in the USPTO or the China National Intellectual Property Administration, which can lead to delays of our patent infringement actions as well as potential findings of invalidity.  Such parties may also seek to obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential or are unenforceable.13Table of ContentsLitigation may be also required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others.  The cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property and of defending our licensing practices has been and may continue to be significant.  As a result, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including in certain jurisdictions the costs and fees of opposing counsel if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.Our plans to license handset manufacturers in China may be adversely affected by a deterioration in United States-China trade and geopolitical relations, our customers facing economic uncertainty there or our failure to establish a positive reputation in China, which could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.Companies headquartered in China currently comprise a substantial portion of the handset manufacturers that remain unlicensed to our patent portfolio.  Our ability to license such manufacturers is, among other things, affected by the macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as well as our business relationships and perceived reputation in China.  The U.S. and Chinese governments are currently engaged in trade negotiations, and the U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory in January 2019 that advised U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution in China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws. This travel advisory and other security concerns, along with public health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have restricted our ability to conduct in-person negotiations with prospective Chinese licensees in the past, and could continue to do so in the future.  In January 2020, the U.S. and China entered into Phase One of the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China (the ""Phase One Trade Agreement""). The Phase One Trade Agreement takes steps to ease certain trade tensions between the U.S. and China, including tensions involving intellectual property theft and forced intellectual property transfers by China. Although the Phase One Trade Agreement is an encouraging sign of progress in the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, questions still remain as to the enforcement of its terms, the resolution of a number of other points of dispute between the parties, and the prevention of further tensions. If the U.S.-China trade dispute re-escalates or relations between the United States and China deteriorate, these conditions could adversely affect our ability to license our patent portfolio to Chinese handset manufacturers. Our ability to license such manufacturers could also be affected by economic uncertainty, particularly in the handset market, in China or by our failure to establish a positive reputation and relationships in China.  The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements with Chinese handset manufacturers, which, in turn, could cause our long-term business, financial condition and operating results to be materially adversely affected.Potential patent and litigation reform legislation, potential USPTO and international patent rule changes, potential legislation affecting mechanisms for patent enforcement and available remedies, and potential changes to the intellectual property rights (“IPR”) policies of worldwide standards bodies, as well as rulings in legal proceedings, may affect our investments in research and development and our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and could have a material adverse effect on our licensing business as well as our business as a whole.  Potential changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our research and development investments, patent prosecution costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure, the number of forums in which we can seek to enforce our patents, the remedies that we may be entitled to in patent litigation, and attorneys’ fees or other remedies that could be sought against us, and may require us to reevaluate and modify our research and development activities and patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies.  Similarly, legislation designed to reduce the jurisdiction and remedial authority of the USITC has periodically been introduced in Congress.Any potential changes in the law, the IPR policies of standards bodies or other developments that reduce the number of forums available or the type of relief available in such forums (such as injunctive relief), restrict permissible licensing practices (such as our ability to license on a worldwide portfolio basis) or that otherwise cause us to seek alternative forums (such as arbitration or state court), would make it more difficult for us to enforce our patents, whether in adversarial proceedings or in negotiations.  Because we have historically depended on the availability of certain forms of legal process to enforce our patents and obtain fair and adequate compensation for our investments in research and development and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, developments that undermine our ability to do so could have a negative impact on future licensing efforts.Rulings in our legal proceedings as well as those of third parties may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement.  For example, in recent years, the USITC and U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have taken some actions that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees, including us.  Decisions that occur in the U.S. or in international forums may change the law applicable to various patent law issues, such as, for example, patentability, validity, claim construction, patent exhaustion, patent misuse, permissible licensing practices, available forums, and remedies such as damages and injunctive relief, in ways that are detrimental to the ability of patentees to enforce patents and obtain suitable relief.14Table of ContentsWe continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.Setbacks in defending our patent licensing practices could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline and could have an adverse effect on our licensing business.Adverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions relating to our licensing practices, including, but not limited to, findings that we have not complied with our FRAND commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities or that any of our license agreements are void or unenforceable, could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and revenue.  Regulatory bodies may assess fines in the event of adverse findings, and as part of court or arbitration proceedings, a judgment could require us to pay damages (including the possibility of treble damages for antitrust claims), such as the Wuhan Intermediate Court’s imposition of a fine of up to one million yuan per day if the Company were to violate its September 23, 2020 discussed in Note 12, “Litigation and Legal Proceedings,”  In addition, to the extent that legal decisions find patent license agreements to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, that could lead to a decrease in the revenue associated with and cash flow generated by such agreements, and, depending on the damages requested, could lead to the refund of certain payments already made.  Finally, adverse legal decisions related to our licensing practices could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements, which, in turn, could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline.Challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements.  One of the most significant challenges we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions.  As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them.  The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense.  Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time.  Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot ensure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline.  The length of time required to negotiate a license agreement also leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.In addition, as discussed more fully above in these Risk Factors
, we are currently operating in a challenging regulatory and judicial environment, which may, under certain circumstances, lead to delays in the negotiation of and entry into new patent license agreements.   Also, as discussed above in these Risk Factors
 and in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K, we are also currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings with potential licensees, with whom we do not yet have a patent license agreement.  Any such delays in the negotiation or entry into new patent license agreements and receipt of the associated revenue stream could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements due to downward product pricing pressures and competition over patent royalties.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless and consumer electronics industries, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates and/or that such rates should be applied to royalty bases smaller than the selling price of an end product (such as the “smallest salable patent practicing unit”). There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain wireless products, including handsets, and other consumer electronics devices that we believe implement our patented inventions, and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of these devices. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products we aim to license. Demands by certain licensees to reduce royalties due to pricing pressure or the number of patent holders seeking royalties on these technologies, could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow.15Table of ContentsOur plans to broaden our revenue opportunities through acquiring or developing technology in new or expanded areas, such as technologies in the consumer electronics and IoT spaces, and enhanced intellectual property sourcing and joint ventures, may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to broaden our revenue opportunities through targeted acquisitions, research partnerships, joint ventures, licensing platforms and the continued development of new technologies.  Increasingly, our future growth in part depends on developing or acquiring technology in new or expanded areas that are used on cellular devices (such as video coding technologies), in cellular infrastructure equipment and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries (such as other consumer electronics devices and the IoT, including the connected home and smart cities, automotive, mobile computing, mobile health and sensor technology), and on third parties incorporating our technology and solutions into device types used in these areas and industry segments.  There is no guarantee that we will succeed in acquiring or developing technology and patents or partnering with inventors and research organizations to create new revenue opportunities and/or add new dimensions to our existing portfolio of intellectual property and potentially create new patent licensing programs. Also, our development activities may experience delays, which could reduce our opportunities for patent licensing or other avenues of revenue generation related to such development activities. In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Some third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot ensure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity, infringement, enforceability or scope of our patents and/or any successful design-around of our patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise, and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.Our technologies may not become patented, adopted by wireless or video standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced technology and related solutions.  However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G, 5G, HEVC, VVC and others, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities.  There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future.  Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and adopted by the relevant standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed.  Competing technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop.  In addition, it is possible that in certain technology areas, such as in the IoT space, the adoption of proprietary systems could compete with or replace standards-based technology.  It is also possible in certain technology areas, such as video coding and the IoT, that open source solutions such as AV1, VP-9 and OCF could compete with or replace proprietary standards-based technology.  If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant standards, or are not adopted by and deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods that we expect, or in the case of open source solutions, do not infringe our technology, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.Delays in renewing or an inability to renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Many of our license agreements have fixed terms.  Although we endeavor to renew license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before or after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all.  If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.16Table of ContentsIncreased scrutiny by antitrust authorities may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business and/or lead to monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions.Domestic and foreign antitrust authorities have increased their scrutiny of the use of SEPs, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors and others.  Such scrutiny has already resulted in enforcement actions against Qualcomm and could lead to additional investigations of, or enforcement actions against, us.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could also result in monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.Our commercialization, licensing and/or mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activities could lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could materially adversely affect our business.The legal doctrines of patent exhaustion and implied license may be subject to different judicial interpretations.  Our commercialization or licensing of certain technologies and/or our M&A activities could potentially lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could adversely affect our patent licensing program(s) and limit our ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under such program(s), whether through the assumption of license agreements that would result in our patents being captured by such agreements, the acquisition of a business that sells or licenses products that practice our patents, or otherwise. In the event of successful challenges by current or prospective licensees based on these doctrines that result in a material decrease to our patent licensing revenue, our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.We may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the integration of the patent licensing business that we acquired from Technicolor in 2018 and the Research & Innovation unit of Technicolor (collectively, the “Technicolor business”).We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our integration of the Technicolor business on a timely basis, or at all, for a variety of reasons, including the following:•failure of the acquisitions to materially increase the value of our core handset licensing business by not increasing the royalty amount we would otherwise derive on each handset, not accelerating the pace of licensing, or not allowing us to avoid litigation to protect our intellectual property;•failure to continue to develop and expand our portfolio of video technology patent assets;•failure to execute a successful business plan and licensing program related to consumer electronics;•the risk that we could lose key employees of the Technicolor business;•challenges associated with managing a geographically remote business;•failure to forecast accurately the long-term value and costs of the Technicolor business or of certain assets acquired in the transactions;•liabilities that are not covered by, or exceed the coverage under, the indemnification or other provisions of the acquisition-related agreements; and•patent validity, infringement, exhaustion or enforcement issues not uncovered during our diligence process.In the event that we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of the Technicolor business, our business and results of operations, and our stock price, may be adversely affected.We have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions or engage in other strategic transactions that could result in significant changes, costs and/or management disruption and that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future acquire companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions.  Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may increase our costs, including but not limited to accounting and legal fees, and may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or of any technologies we may acquire.17Table of ContentsThe integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, including, among others: successfully integrating new employees, technology and/or products; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.  As a result, we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully.  In addition, we cannot be certain that the integration of acquired companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipate will be realized from such acquisitions.  Our plans to integrate and/or expand upon research and development programs and technologies obtained through acquisitions may result in products or technologies that are not adopted by the market, or the market may adopt solutions competitive to our products or technologies.  Our revenues are derived primarily from a limited number of licensees or customers.We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees or customers for the foreseeable future.  For example, in 2020, Apple, Samsung and Huawei accounted for approximately 31%, 22% and 15% of our total revenues, respectively.  In the event that we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements upon expiration, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations (for example, due to a credit issue or in connection with a legal dispute or similar proceeding) under their respective license agreements, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, in the event that there is a material decrease in shipments of licensed products by one of our per-unit licensees, our revenues from such licensee could significantly decline and our future revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected.Our strategy to diversify our patent-based revenue by pursuing alternative patent licensing arrangements and patent sales may not be successful.There is no guarantee that we will succeed in our pursuit of select patent alternative licensing arrangements or patent sales, and, if we are successful, there is no guarantee that the revenue and cash flow generated through such alternative licensing arrangements (such as the Avanci licensing platform or the Sisvel VP9/AV1 patent pools) or patent sales will be greater than the revenue and cash flow we would have generated if we had retained and/or licensed the patents ourselves. In addition, potential licensees may be reluctant to enter into new patent license agreements, and current licensees may be reluctant to renew their agreements, either at all or on terms acceptable to the Company, based on the fact that we have sold portions of our patent portfolio or the belief that we plan to sell or transfer some of the patents we are asking them to license.A portion of our revenue and cash flow are dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A portion of our licensing revenues is dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global, regional and/or country-specific economic conditions and/or public health concerns (e.g., the current coronavirus outbreak), country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, demand and buying patterns of end users, which are often driven by replacement and innovation cycles, the service life of products incorporating our technologies, competition for our licensees' products, supply chain disruptions, and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products.  In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our products or technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect, (ii) a decline in the financial condition or market position of any licensee or (iii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global or regional economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies, lower demand or otherwise.  It is also difficult to predict the timing, nature and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement (including as a result of  the unwillingness of our licensees to compensate us for such past infringement) and new licenses, strategic relationships and the resolution of legal proceedings.  The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition.  In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for upfront fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees.  As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period.  Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.18Table of ContentsOur revenue may be affected by the deployment of future-generation wireless standards in place of 3G, 4G and 5G technologies or future-generation video standards, by the timing of such deployment, or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.We own an evolving portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G and 5G cellular technologies and non-cellular technologies including video coding technologies, and our patent portfolio licensing program for future-generation wireless standards or video coding standards may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our current licensing programs.  Although we continue to participate in worldwide standards bodies and contribute our intellectual property to future-generation wireless and video coding standards, including standards that will define 5G, our technologies might not be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, we may not be as successful in the licensing of future-generation products as we have been in licensing products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards, or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such products that is comparable to that which we have historically received on products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards.  Furthermore, if there is a delay in the standardization and/or deployment of 5G or future video coding standards, our business and revenue could be negatively impacted.The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designed to operate in accordance with specified technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or anticipated to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement.  Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us.  We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees, and we may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to us or at all.  Further, such extensions, modifications or new license agreements may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to any extension, modification or new license.Our plans to expand our revenue opportunities through commercializing our market-ready technologies and acquiring and/or developing new technology with commercial applicability may not be successful.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to expand our revenue opportunities through the continued development, commercialization and licensing of technology projects, including in the video coding and IoT spaces.  Commercial success depends on many factors, including the demand for the technology, the highly competitive markets for our technology products, regulatory issues associated with such technology products, and effective marketing and licensing or product sales. Our technology development and acquisition activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, if at all, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing.  In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect, and/or our offerings may require robust ecosystems of customers and service providers that may fail to materialize.  Technology markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, infrastructure improvements.  Additionally, investing in technology development is costly and may require structural changes to the organization that could require additional costs, including without limitation legal and accounting fees.  Furthermore, delays or failures to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate technology development efforts and secure support for our technologies or delays or failures to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows, or decrease our ability to remain competitive. In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.19Table of ContentsThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other potential future public health crises, pandemics or similar events will adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant worldwide uncertainty, volatility and economic disruption. The extent to which COVID-19 and any other potential future public health crises, pandemics or similar events will adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations is dependent upon numerous factors, many of which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and uncontrollable. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the duration and scope of the pandemic; (ii) governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic or other event, including travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, work-from-home and shelter-in-place orders and shut-downs; (iii) the impact on our customers, including those that are presently unlicensed, and other business partners; (iv) the impact on U.S. and global economies and the timing and rate of economic recovery; (v) potential adverse effects on the financial markets and access to capital; (vi) potential goodwill or other impairment charges; (vii) increased cybersecurity risks as a result of pervasive remote working conditions; (viii) our ability to effectively carry out our operations due to any adverse impacts on the health and safety of our employees and their families; (ix) the ability of our customers to timely satisfy their payment obligations to us; and (x) fluctuations in global shipments of handsets and consumer electronics devices. Furthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees have been required to work from home and our office locations have remain closed for an extended period of time. The significant increase in remote working could exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased risk of cybersecurity events, improper dissemination of personal or confidential information and breakdowns in internal controls and processes.We face risks from doing business and maintaining offices in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees, potential licensees and customers are international, and our licensees, potential licensees and customers sell their products to markets throughout the world.  In addition, in recent years, we have expanded, and we may continue to expand, our international operations, opening offices in France, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Germany.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties of operating internationally and could be affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; biased enforcement of foreign laws and regulations to promote industrial or economic policies at our expense; retaliatory practices by foreign actors; currency control regulations; export license requirements and restrictions on the use of technology; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments; foreign labor regulations; anti-corruption laws; public health issues; and difficulty in staffing and managing operations remotely.  We also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees, potential licensees and customers do business.In addition, adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies.  If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.  In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our products and solutions that we may market or set forth, including into the standards-setting arena.  Due to competing products and solutions, our products and solutions may not find a viable commercial marketplace or, where applicable, be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold SEPs, for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain product or products.  In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property.  To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.20Table of ContentsOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements.  Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable.  The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.Concentration and consolidation in the wireless communications industry could adversely affect our business.There is some concentration among participants in the wireless communications industry, and the industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses, and these trends may continue.  For example, in 2020, Samsung, Apple and Huawei collectively accounted for approximately 50% of worldwide smartphone shipments.  Although the rollout of 5G handsets is still in its early stages, we anticipate a similar level of concentration in worldwide shipments of those units as well. Any further concentration or sale within the wireless industry among handset providers and/or original design manufacturers (""ODMs"") may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations.  We may also face a reduction in the number of licensing opportunities or existing royalty obligations as a result of government-imposed bans or other restrictions on the importation, manufacture and/or sale of cellular handsets by certain companies.  In addition, acquisitions of, or consolidation among, ODMs could cause handset providers who outsource manufacturing to make supply chain changes, which in turn could result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations (for example, if manufacturing is moved from an ODM with which we have a patent license agreement to an ODM with which we do not).  Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.Our use of open source software could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.Certain of our technology and our suppliers’ technology may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions.  Licensing of such technology may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software.  For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for derivative works available or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different from what we customarily use to license our technology.  While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that, if we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our technology, discontinue the sale of our technology, release the source code of our proprietary technology to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  There is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.The United States government enacted tax reform in 2017 and continues to provide regulatory guidance related to tax reform provisions, and state authorities continue to provide guidance around the application of tax reform provisions, that in each case could impact future effective tax rates favorably or unfavorably. The United States government could enact further tax reform legislation, which could adversely impact our tax rate. The international tax environment also continues to change as a result of both coordinated efforts by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, which could ultimately have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses such as ours. Accordingly, our tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof; changes in tax rates; and assessments and any related tax, interest or penalties. If we are deemed to owe additional taxes, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.21Table of ContentsChanges to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.  We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding.  Pursuant to the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued, including the $20.9 million net discrete tax benefits we recognized in 2020 primarily related to the expected amendment of a prior year tax return to utilize a tax asset generated in the current year.  As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers, as well as the cost of new handsets could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is partially dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services and cellular handsets that utilize our technology.  In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies.  The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services.  Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers.  The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks.  Growth in the number of cellular handsets may slow as the number of people worldwide without a cellular handset declines.  In addition, if the cost of cellular handsets increases, customers may be less likely to replace their existing devices with new devices.  The growth of our business could be adversely affected if either of these events occur.Market projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.  The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions.  In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate.  The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our engineering services business could subject us to specific costs and risks that we might fail to manage adequately.We derive a portion of our revenues from engineering services.  Any mismanagement of, or negative development in, a number of areas, including, among others, the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services, the financial health of our customers, and our reputation for performance under our service contracts, could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline, damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract future licensees, which would in turn harm our operating results.  If we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts, we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract.  We need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues.  Our failure to monitor these services adequately may harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our per-unit licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue. The standard terms of our per-unit license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis.  Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute.  From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end.22Table of ContentsOur technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies.  Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the marketplace or in the standards setting arena.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful.  Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected.  In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants.  Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated.  These attempts, which in some cases could be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others.  We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business or personal information (whether through a breach of our own systems or the breach of a system of a third party that provides services to us) could harm our competitive or negotiating positions, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, compromise our patent enforcement strategies or outlook, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.  In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, licensees’, or customers’ confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. Our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules and policies and other obligations regarding data protection.We  also be affected by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.  For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") adopted by the European Commission became effective in May 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA"") adopted by the California State Legislature became effective in January 2020, and China adopted a new cybersecurity law as of June 2017.  Complying with the GDPR, the CCPA and other existing and emerging and changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices.  Non-compliance could result in monetary penalties or significant legal liability.If wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks, demand for products of our licensees could decrease.Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate medical equipment.  Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the products of our licensees.  In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for the products of our licensees.23Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and our Convertible NotesOur shareholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.Our current dividend policy contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share on our outstanding common stock.  We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy.  However, the dividend policy and the payment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.  Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends in the future.  Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.Our approved stock repurchase programs may not result in a positive return of capital to shareholders.Our board-approved stock repurchase program may not return value to shareholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock.  Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver shareholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.  In addition, the board could choose to suspend or terminate the stock repurchase program at any time.Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $424.2 million, inclusive of debt resulting from the Technicolor Patent Acquisition (refer to Note 5, ""Business Combinations and Other Transactions,"" within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information).  This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our 2.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024 (the ""2024 Notes"");•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes.In addition, as more fully described in Note 10 “Obligations” within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we made an irrevocable election to “Net Share Settle” our obligations under the 2024 Notes, which requires us to pay the outstanding principal amount due under the 2024 Notes in cash.  Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the 2024 Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes and to fund other liquidity needs.  If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the 2024 Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the 2024 Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other currently existing or future outstanding indebtedness.24Table of ContentsThe convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the  2024 Notes may affect the value of the 2024 Notes, respectively, and the market price of our common stock.In connection with each offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) and sold warrants to the respective option counterparties.  These transactions will be accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity.  The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes.  The warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.In addition, the respective option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may modify their respective hedge positions from time to time (including during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2024 Notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions.The potential effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The respective option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that such option counterparties may default under the respective convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral.  If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the applicable convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock.  In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock.  We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.Provisions of the 2024 Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the 2024 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change under the respective 2024 Notes, holders of the 2024 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their applicable 2024 Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such 2024 Notes at a price of 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions.  These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock"
5,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2020-02-20,"     RISK FACTORS. We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.Risks Related to Our BusinessOur plans to license handset manufacturers in China may be adversely affected by a deterioration in United States-China trade and geopolitical relations, our customers facing economic uncertainty there or our failure to establish a positive reputation in China, which could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.Companies headquartered in China currently comprise a substantial portion of the handset manufacturers that remain unlicensed to our patent portfolio.  Our ability to license such manufacturers is, among other things, affected by the macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as well as our business relationships and perceived reputation in China.  The U.S. and Chinese governments are currently engaged in trade negotiations, and the U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory in January 2019 that advised U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution in China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws. This travel advisory and other security concerns have restricted our ability to conduct in-person negotiations with prospective Chinese licensees in the past, and they, along with certain public health concerns (e.g., the current coronavirus outbreak), could do so in the future.  In January 2020, the U.S. and China entered into Phase One of the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China (the ""Phase One Trade Agreement""). The Phase One Trade Agreement takes steps to ease certain trade tensions between the U.S. and China, including tensions involving intellectual property theft and forced intellectual property transfers by China. Although the Phase One Trade Agreement is an encouraging sign of progress in the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, questions still remain as to the enforcement of its terms, the resolution of a number of other points of dispute between the parties, and the prevention of further tensions. If the U.S.-China trade dispute re-escalates or relations between the United States and China deteriorate, these conditions could adversely affect our ability to license our patent portfolio to Chinese handset manufacturers.  Our ability to license such manufacturers could also be affected by economic uncertainty, particularly in the handset market, in China or by our failure to establish a positive reputation and relationships in China.  The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements with Chinese handset manufacturers, which, in turn, could cause our long-term business, financial condition and operating results to be materially adversely affected.Royalty rates, or other terms, under our patent license agreements could be subject to determination through arbitration or other third-party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings, and arbitrators, judges or other third-party adjudicators 11Table of Contentsor regulators could determine that our patent royalty rates should be at levels lower than our agreed or historical rates or otherwise make determinations resulting in less favorable terms and conditions under our patent license agreements.Historically, we strive for the terms of our patent license agreements, including our royalty rates, to be reached through arms-length bilateral negotiations with our licensees. We could agree, as we did with Huawei pursuant to our December 2013 settlement agreement, to have royalty rates, or other terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators) and it is also possible that courts or regulators could decide to set or otherwise determine the FRAND consistency of such terms or the manner in which such terms are determined, including by determining a worldwide royalty rate for our SEPs. Changes to or clarifications of our obligations to be prepared to offer licenses to SEPs on FRAND terms and conditions could require such terms, including our royalty rates, to be determined through third party adjudications. Finally, we and certain of our current and prospective licensees have initiated, and we and others could in the future initiate, legal proceedings or regulatory proceedings requesting third party adjudicators or regulators to set FRAND terms and conditions for, or determine the FRAND-consistency of current terms and conditions in, our patent license agreements, and which could result in such third party adjudicators or regulators determining a worldwide royalty rate for our SEPs. To the extent that our patent royalty rates for our patent license agreements are determined through arbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings rather than through bilateral negotiations, because such proceedings are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and there are currently few precedents for such determinations, it is possible that royalty rates may be lower than our historical rates, and this could also have a negative impact on royalties we are able to obtain from future licensees, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.  In addition, to the extent that other terms and conditions for our patent license agreements are determined through such means, such terms and conditions could be less favorable than our historical terms and conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our licensing business. Due to the nature of our business, we could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights and to defend our licensing practices.While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying users and potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import or use products, we have in the past commenced, and may in the future, commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we have faced, and could continue to face, counterclaims and other legal proceedings that challenge the essential nature of our patents, or that claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  Litigation adversaries may allege that we have not complied with certain commitments to standards-setting organizations and therefore that we are not entitled to the relief that we seek.  For example, a party may allege that we have not complied with an obligation to offer a license to a party on FRAND terms and conditions, and may also file antitrust claims, unfair competition claims or regulatory complaints on that or other bases, and may seek damages and other relief based on such claims.  Litigation adversaries have also filed against us, and other third parties may in the future file, validity challenges such as inter partes proceedings in the USPTO, which can lead to delays of our patent infringement actions as well as potential findings of invalidity.Litigation may be also required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others.Third parties could commence litigation against us seeking to invalidate our patents or obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential, are invalid or are unenforceable.  In addition, current and prospective licensees have initiated proceedings against us claiming, and others in the future may claim, that we have not complied with our FRAND licensing commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities.The cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property and of defending our licensing practices has been and may continue to be significant.  As a result, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including in certain jurisdictions the costs and fees of opposing counsel if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.Potential patent and litigation reform legislation, potential USPTO and international patent rule changes, potential legislation affecting mechanisms for patent enforcement and available remedies, and potential changes to the intellectual property rights (“IPR”) policies of worldwide standards bodies, as well as rulings in legal proceedings, may affect our investments in research and development and our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and could have a material adverse effect on our licensing business as well as our business as a whole.     12Table of ContentsPotential changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our research and development investments, patent prosecution costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure, the number of forums in which we can seek to enforce our patents, the remedies that we may be entitled to in patent litigation, and attorneys’ fees or other remedies that could be sought against us, and may require us to reevaluate and modify our research and development activities and patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies.  Similarly, legislation designed to reduce the jurisdiction and remedial authority of the USITC has periodically been introduced in Congress.Any potential changes in the law, the IPR policies of standards bodies or other developments that reduce the number of forums available or the type of relief available in such forums (such as injunctive relief), restrict permissible licensing practices (such as our ability to license on a worldwide portfolio basis) or that otherwise cause us to seek alternative forums (such as arbitration or state court), would make it more difficult for us to enforce our patents, whether in adversarial proceedings or in negotiations.  Because we have historically depended on the availability of certain forms of legal process to enforce our patents and obtain fair and adequate compensation for our investments in research and development and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, developments that undermine our ability to do so could have a negative impact on future licensing efforts.Rulings in our legal proceedings as well as those of third parties may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement.  For example, in recent years, the USITC and U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have taken some actions that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees, including us.  Decisions that occur in the U.S. or in international forums may change the law applicable to various patent law issues, such as, for example, patentability, validity, claim construction, patent exhaustion, patent misuse, permissible licensing practices, available forums, and remedies such as damages and injunctive relief, in ways that are detrimental to the ability of patentees to enforce patents and obtain suitable relief.We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.Setbacks in defending our patent licensing practices could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline and could have an adverse effect on our licensing business.Adverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions relating to our licensing practices, including, but not limited to, findings that we have not complied with our FRAND commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities or that any of our license agreements are void or unenforceable, could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and revenue.  Regulatory bodies may assess fines in the event of adverse findings, and as part of court or arbitration proceedings, a judgment could require us to pay damages (including the possibility of treble damages for antitrust claims).  In addition, to the extent that legal decisions find patent license agreements to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, that could lead to a decrease in the revenue associated with and cash flow generated by such agreements, and, depending on the damages requested, could lead to the refund of certain payments already made.  Finally, adverse legal decisions related to our licensing practices could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements, which, in turn, could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline.Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements due to downward product pricing pressures and competition over patent royalties.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless and consumer electronics industries, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates and/or that such rates should be applied to royalty bases smaller than the selling price of an end product (such as the “smallest salable patent practicing unit”). There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain wireless products, including handsets, and other consumer electronics devices that we believe implement our patented inventions, and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of these devices. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products we aim to license. Demands by certain licensees to reduce royalties due to pricing pressure or the number of patent holders seeking royalties on these technologies, could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow.Our plans to broaden our revenue opportunities through acquiring or developing technology in new or expanded areas, such as technologies in the consumer electronics and IoT spaces, and enhanced intellectual property sourcing and joint ventures, may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to broaden our revenue opportunities through targeted acquisitions, research partnerships, joint ventures and the continued development of new technologies.  Increasingly, our future growth in 13Table of Contentspart depends on developing or acquiring technology in new or expanded areas that are used on cellular devices (such as video coding technologies) and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries (such as other consumer electronics devices and the IoT, including the connected home and smart cities, automotive, mobile computing, mobile health and sensor technology), and on third parties incorporating our technology and solutions into device types used in these areas and industry segments.  There is no guarantee that we will succeed in acquiring or developing technology and patents or partnering with inventors and research organizations to create new revenue opportunities and/or add new dimensions to our existing portfolio of intellectual property and potentially create new patent licensing programs. Also, our development activities may experience delays, which could reduce our opportunities for patent licensing or other avenues of revenue generation related to such development activities. In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Some third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot ensure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity, infringement, enforceability or scope of our patents and/or any successful design-around of our patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise, and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.Our technologies may not become patented, adopted by wireless or video standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced technology and related solutions.  However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G, 5G, HEVC and others, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities.  There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future.  Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and adopted by the relevant standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed.  Competing technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop.  In addition, it is possible that in certain technology areas, such as in the IoT space, the adoption of proprietary systems could compete with or replace standards-based technology.  It is also possible in certain technology areas, such as video coding and the IoT, that open source solutions such as AV1, VP-9 and OCF could compete with or replace proprietary standards-based technology.  If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant standards, or are not adopted by and deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods that we expect, or in the case of open source solutions, do not infringe our technology, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.Delays in renewing or an inability to renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Many of our license agreements have fixed terms.  Although we endeavor to renew license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before or after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all.  If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.Increased scrutiny by antitrust authorities may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business and/or lead to monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions.Domestic and foreign antitrust authorities have increased their scrutiny of the use of SEPs, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors and others.  Such scrutiny has already resulted in enforcement actions against Qualcomm and could lead to additional investigations of, or enforcement actions against, us.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could also result in monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.14Table of ContentsOur commercialization, licensing and/or mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activities could lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could materially adversely affect our business.The legal doctrines of patent exhaustion and implied license may be subject to different judicial interpretations.  Our commercialization or licensing of certain technologies and/or our M&A activities could potentially lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could adversely affect our patent licensing program(s) and limit our ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under such program(s), whether through the assumption of license agreements that would result in our patents being captured by such agreements, the acquisition of a business that sells or licenses products that practice our patents, or otherwise.  In the event of successful challenges by current or prospective licensees based on these doctrines that result in a material decrease to our patent licensing revenue, our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.We may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the integration of the patent licensing business that we acquired from Technicolor in 2018 and the Research & Innovation unit of Technicolor (collectively, the “Technicolor business”).We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our integration of the Technicolor business on a timely basis, or at all, for a variety of reasons, including the following:•failure of the acquisitions to materially increase the value of our core handset licensing business by not increasing the royalty amount we would otherwise derive on each handset, not accelerating the pace of licensing, or not allowing us to avoid litigation to protect our intellectual property;•failure to continue to develop and expand our portfolio of video technology patent assets;•failure to execute a successful business plan and licensing program related to consumer electronics;•the risk that we could lose key employees of the Technicolor business;•challenges associated with managing a geographically remote business;•failure to forecast accurately the long-term value and costs of the Technicolor business or of certain assets acquired in the transactions;•liabilities that are not covered by, or exceed the coverage under, the indemnification or other provisions of the acquisition-related agreements; and•patent validity, infringement, exhaustion or enforcement issues not uncovered during our diligence process.In the event that we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of the Technicolor business, our business and results of operations, and our stock price, may be adversely affected.We have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions or engage in other strategic transactions that could result in significant changes, costs and/or management disruption and that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future acquire companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions.  Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may increase our costs, including but not limited to accounting and legal fees, and may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or of any technologies we may acquire.Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the acquired companies, businesses and/or assets in an efficient and effective manner.  The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, including, among others: successfully integrating new employees, technology and/or products; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.  As a result, we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully.In addition, we cannot be certain that the integration of acquired companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits that we anticipate will be realized from such acquisitions.  Our plans to integrate and/or expand upon research and development programs and technologies obtained through acquisitions may result in products or technologies that are not adopted by the market, or the market may adopt solutions competitive to our products or technologies.  We may not derive any commercial value from the acquired technology or intellectual property or from future technologies or products based on the acquired technology and/or intellectual property.  In addition, to the extent we are separately seeking a patent license from a customer or customers of an acquired entity, the acquired entity may lose such customers.  Following the completion of the acquisition, we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by, or exceed the coverage under, the indemnification protection we may obtain, and we may encounter patent 15Table of Contentsvalidity, infringement or enforcement issues or unforeseen expenses not uncovered during our diligence process.  Any acquired company or business would be subject to its own risks that may or may not be the same as the risks already disclosed herein.Challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements.  One of the most significant challenges we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions.  As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them.  The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense.  Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time.  Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot ensure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline.  The length of time required to negotiate a license agreement also leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.In addition, as discussed more fully above in these Risk Factors
, we are currently operating in a challenging regulatory and judicial environment, which may, under certain circumstances, lead to delays in the negotiation of and entry into new patent license agreements.   Also, as discussed above in these Risk Factors
 and in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K, we are also currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings with potential licensees, with whom we do not yet have a patent license agreement.  Any such delays in the negotiation or entry into new patent license agreements and receipt of the associated revenue stream could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Our revenues are derived primarily from a limited number of licensees or customers.We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees or customers for the foreseeable future.  For example, in 2019, Apple, Samsung and LG Electronics accounted for approximately 35%, 25% and 10% of our total revenues, respectively.  In the event that we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements upon expiration, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations (for example, due to a credit issue or in connection with a legal dispute or similar proceeding) under their respective license agreements, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, in the event that there is a material decrease in shipments of licensed products by one of our per-unit licensees, our revenues from such licensee could significantly decline and our future revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected.Our strategy to diversify our patent-based revenue by pursuing alternative patent licensing arrangements and patent sales may not be successful.There is no guarantee that we will succeed in our pursuit of select patent licensing arrangements or patent sales, and, if we are successful, there is no guarantee that the revenue and cash flow generated through such alternative licensing arrangements (such as the Signal Trust and the Avanci licensing platform) or patent sales will be greater than the revenue and cash flow we would have generated if we had retained and/or licensed the patents ourselves. In addition, potential licensees may be reluctant to enter into new patent license agreements, and current licensees may be reluctant to renew their agreements, either at all or on terms acceptable to the Company, based on the fact that we have sold portions of our patent portfolio or the belief that we plan to sell or transfer some of the patents we are asking them to license.A portion of our revenue and cash flow are dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A portion of our licensing revenues is dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global, regional and/or country-specific economic conditions and/or public health concerns (e.g., the current coronavirus outbreak), country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, demand and buying patterns of end users, which are often driven by replacement and innovation cycles, the service life of products incorporating our technologies, competition for our licensees' products, supply chain disruptions, and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products.  In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our products or technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect, (ii) a decline in the financial condition or market position of any licensee or (iii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global or regional economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies, lower demand or otherwise.  It is also difficult to predict the 16Table of Contentstiming, nature and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement (including as a result of  the unwillingness of our licensees to compensate us for such past infringement) and new licenses, strategic relationships and the resolution of legal proceedings.  The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition.  In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for upfront fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees.  As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period.  Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.Our revenue may be affected by the deployment of future-generation wireless standards in place of 3G, 4G and 5G technologies or future-generation video standards, by the timing of such deployment, or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.Although we own an evolving portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G and 5G cellular technologies and non-cellular technologies including video coding technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program for future-generation wireless standards or video coding standards may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our current licensing programs.  Although we continue to participate in worldwide standards bodies and contribute our intellectual property to future-generation wireless and video coding standards, including standards that will define 5G, our technologies might not be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, we may not be as successful in the licensing of future-generation products as we have been in licensing products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards, or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such products that is comparable to that which we have historically received on products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards.  Furthermore, if there is a delay in the standardization and/or deployment of 5G or future video coding standards, our business and revenue could be negatively impacted.The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designed to operate in accordance with specified technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or anticipated to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement.  Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us.  We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees.  We may not be able to extend or modify these license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, on financial terms acceptable to us, without affecting the other material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees or at all.  Further, such extensions, modifications or new license agreements may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to any extension, modification or new license.We face risks from doing business and maintaining offices in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees, potential licensees and customers are international, and our licensees, potential licensees and customers sell their products to markets throughout the world.  In addition, in recent years, we have expanded, and we may continue to expand, our international operations, opening offices in France, the United Kingdom, China, Belgium and Germany.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties of operating internationally and could be affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; biased enforcement of foreign laws and regulations to promote industrial or economic policies at our expense; retaliatory practices by foreign actors; currency control regulations and variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency; export license requirements and restrictions on the use of technology; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments; foreign labor regulations; anti-corruption laws; and difficulty in staffing and managing operations remotely.  In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees, potential licensees and customers do business.We depend on key senior management, engineering, patent and licensing resources.Our future success depends largely upon the effectiveness of our executive officers and other key personnel, including our ability to put in place adequate succession plans for such key personnel, and/or organizational strategies related to the departure of such key personnel.  Our success also depends in part on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized patent, licensing, engineering and other skills.  The market for such talent in our industry is extremely competitive as a result in part of the specialized nature of our industry.  In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and with significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface , video coding, and artificial intelligence technologies.  Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions in any litigation, arbitration or regulatory proceeding, by our ability to offer competitive cash and equity compensation, the perception of our company both internally and externally, and work environment conditions and by the 17Table of Contentsgeographic location of our various offices.  The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience or to have in place adequate succession plans and/or organizational strategies related to the departure of certain key personnel could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements and undertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as our ability to meet our strategic objectives.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our products and solutions that we may market or set forth, including into the standards-setting arena.  Due to competing products and solutions, our products and solutions may not find a viable commercial marketplace or, where applicable, be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold SEPs, for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain product or products.  In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property.  To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements.  Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable.  The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.Concentration and consolidation in the wireless communications industry could adversely affect our business.There is some concentration among participants in the wireless communications industry, and the industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses, and these trends may continue.  For example, in 2019, Samsung, Apple and Huawei collectively accounted for approximately 40% of worldwide shipments of 3G and 4G handsets and 50% of worldwide smartphone shipments.  Although the rollout of 5G handsets is still in its early stages, we anticipate a similar level of concentration in worldwide shipments of those units as well. Any further concentration or sale within the wireless industry among handset providers and/or original design manufacturers (""ODMs"") may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations.  We may also face a reduction in the number of licensing opportunities or existing royalty obligations as a result of government-imposed bans or other restrictions on the importation, manufacture and/or sale of cellular handsets by certain companies.  In addition, acquisitions of, or consolidation among, ODMs could cause handset providers who outsource manufacturing to make supply chain changes, which in turn could result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations (for example, if manufacturing is moved from an ODM with which we have a patent license agreement to an ODM with which we do not).  Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.Our use of open source software could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.Certain of our technology and our suppliers’ technology may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions.  Licensing of such technology may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software.  For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for derivative works available or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different from what we customarily use to license our technology.  While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that, if we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our technology, discontinue the sale of our technology, release the source code of our proprietary technology to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  There is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.18Table of ContentsChanges to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.  We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding.  Pursuant to the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued.  As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Changes in financial accounting standards or policies may affect our reported financial condition or results of operations and, in certain cases, could cause a decline and/or fluctuations in the price of our common stock.From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the ""FASB"") and the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") change their guidance governing the form and content of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), such as the FASB and the SEC, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions with regard to how these standards should be applied.  A change in accounting principles or their interpretation can have a significant effect on our reported results.  In certain cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently.  Potential changes in reporting standards could substantially change our reporting practices in a number of areas, including revenue recognition and recording of assets and liabilities, and affect our reported financial condition or results of operations.The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers, as well as the cost of new handsets could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is partially dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services and cellular handsets that utilize our technology.  In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies.  The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services.  Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers.  The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks.  Growth in the number of cellular handsets may slow as the number of people worldwide without a cellular handset declines.  In addition, if the cost of cellular handsets increases, customers may be less likely to replace their existing devices with new devices.  The growth of our business could be adversely affected if either of these events occur.Market projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.  The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions.  In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate.  The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our engineering services business could subject us to specific costs and risks that we might fail to manage adequately.We derive a portion of our revenues from engineering services.  Any mismanagement of, or negative development in, a number of areas, including, among others, the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under our service contracts, could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline, damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract future licensees, which would in turn harm our operating results.  If we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts, we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract.  We need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we 19Table of Contentsdo not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues.  Our failure to monitor these services adequately may harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our per-unit licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.    The standard terms of our per-unit license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis.  Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute.  From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end.Our plans to expand our revenue opportunities through commercializing our market-ready technologies and acquiring and/or developing new technology with commercial applicability may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to expand our revenue opportunities through the continued development, commercialization and licensing of technology projects, including in the IoT space.  Our technology development and acquisition activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, if at all, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing.  In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect.  Technology markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, infrastructure improvements.  Additionally, investing in technology development is costly and may require structural changes to the organization that could require additional costs, including without limitation legal and accounting fees.  Furthermore, delays or failures to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate technology development efforts and secure support for our technologies or delays or failures to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows, or decrease our ability to remain competitive.We have in the past and may in the future make investments that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future make investments in other entities by purchasing minority equity interests or corporate bonds/notes in publicly traded or privately held companies.  Most strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and may not become liquid for a period of time, if ever.  In some cases, strategic investments may serve as consideration for a license in lieu of cash royalties.  In addition, other investments may not generate financial returns or may result in losses due to market volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. We have made in the past and may make in the future strategic investments in early-stage companies, which may require us to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of those companies.  Our share of any such losses may adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments.Our investments in new commercial initiatives may not be successful or generate meaningful revenues.We have invested, and may continue to invest, in new businesses focused on commercializing technology that we have developed, incubated internally and/or acquired, such as video coding technology and other technologies for use on consumer electronics devices.  Commercial success depends on many factors, including the demand for the technology, the highly competitive markets for our technology products, regulatory issues associated with such technology products, and effective marketing and licensing or product sales.  In addition, our new technology offerings may require robust ecosystems of customers and service providers that may fail to materialize.  Further, the establishment and operation of these commercial initiatives requires significant support, including technical, legal and financial resources.  It is possible that these commercial initiatives will not be successful and/or will not achieve meaningful revenues for a number of years, if at all.  Further, we may attempt to develop technologies or services that we believe we would be able to sell or license commercially using inside or outside technical, legal and financial resources.  If our new commercial initiatives are not successful, or are not successful in the timeframe we anticipate, we may incur significant costs, our business may not grow as anticipated and/or our reputation may be harmed.  In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.20Table of ContentsOur technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies.  Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the marketplace or in the standards setting arena.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful.  Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected.  In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants.  Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our activities and international strategic investments.We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which may change over time as our business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.  We operate and invest globally.  Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings.  Our exposure to foreign currencies may increase as we expand into new markets.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies.  If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.  In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.•If, as a result of tax treaty procedures, the U.S. government reaches an agreement with certain foreign governments to whom we have paid foreign taxes, resulting in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits, such agreement could result in foreign currency gain or loss.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches and our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules and policies and other obligations regarding data protection.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated.  These attempts, which in some cases could be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others.  We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business or personal information (whether through a breach of our own systems or the breach of a system of a third party that provides services to us) could harm our competitive or negotiating positions, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, compromise our patent enforcement strategies or outlook, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.  In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, licensees’, or customers’ confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. We could also be affected by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.  For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") adopted by the European Commission became effective in May 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA"") adopted by the California State Legislature became effective in January 2020, and China adopted a new cybersecurity law as of June 2017.  Complying with the GDPR, the CCPA and other existing and emerging and changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices.  Non-compliance could result in monetary penalties or significant legal liability.21Table of ContentsIf wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks, demand for products of our licensees could decrease.Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate medical equipment.  Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the products of our licensees.  In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for the products of our licensees.The United Kingdom's (""U.K."") decision to exit the European Union (""E.U."") will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.The U.K. held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority voted for the U.K.'s withdrawal from the E.U. (commonly referred to as ""Brexit""), and on January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally withdrew from the E.U. The U.K. is now in a transition period until December 31, 2020 during which time the final terms of Brexit are to be negotiated with the E.U. The terms of Brexit and the U.K.'s relationship with the E.U. going forward continue to be uncertain for global companies like ours that conduct business both in the U.K. and the E.U. The actual and perceived impacts of Brexit may adversely affect business activity and economic and market conditions in the U.K., the Eurozone and globally, and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. In addition, Brexit could lead to additional political, legal and economic instability in the U.K and the E.U. While we have not experienced any material financial impacts from Brexit on our business to date, we cannot predict its future implications. Any impact on our business from Brexit in the long term will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, tax treaties, trade, regulatory and other negotiations that the U.K and the E.U. conduct.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and our Convertible NotesThe price of our common stock is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our common stock, and such fluctuations could continue. From January 2, 2018 to February 18, 2020, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $47.02 per share to a high of $85.85 per share. The market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:•the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC and announcements relating to licensing, technology development, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and intellectual property impacting us or our business;•announcements concerning strategic transactions, such as commercial initiatives, joint ventures, strategic investments, acquisitions or divestitures;•financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;•changes in GAAP, including new accounting standards that may materially affect our revenue recognition;•changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;•investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-term goals;•changes in market share of significant licensees;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other wireless communications companies generally; and•market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole.In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.Our shareholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.Our current dividend policy contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share on our outstanding common stock.  We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy.  However, the dividend policy and the payment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in 22Table of Contentscompliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.  Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends in the future.  Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.Approved stock repurchase programs may not result in a positive return of capital to shareholders.Our board-approved stock repurchase program may not return value to shareholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock.  Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver shareholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $516.0 million, inclusive of debt resulting from the Technicolor Patent Acquisition (refer to Note 5, ""Business Combinations and Other Transactions,"" within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information).  This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our 1.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the ""2020 Notes"") and our 2.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024 (the ""2024 Notes"" and, together with the 2020 Notes, the ""Convertible Notes"");•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Convertible Notes.Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the Convertible Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the Convertible Notes and to fund other liquidity needs.  If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the 2020 Notes and/or the 20204 Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes and/or the 2024 Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other currently existing or future outstanding indebtedness.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the 2020 Notes and the 2024 Notes may affect the value of the 2020 Notes and/or the 2024 Notes, respectively, and the market price of our common stock.In connection with each offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) and sold warrants to the respective option counterparties.  These transactions will be accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity.  The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes.  The warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.In addition, the respective option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may modify their respective hedge positions from time to time (including during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2020 Notes and/or the 2024 Notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions.23Table of ContentsThe potential effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Provisions of the Convertible Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the Convertible Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change under the respective Convertible Notes, holders of the 2020 Notes and/or the 2024 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their applicable Convertible Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such Convertible Notes at a price of 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions.  These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The respective option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that such option counterparties may default under the respective convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral.  If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the applicable convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock.  In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock.  We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.The accounting method for convertible debt securities, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.In May 2008, the FASB, issued ASC 470-20.  Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments, such as the Convertible Notes, that may be settled partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost.  ASC 470-20 requires the fair value of the conversion option of the 2020 Notes and the 2024 Notes be reported as a component of shareholders’ equity and included in the additional paid-in-capital on our consolidated balance sheet.  The value of the conversion option of the 2020 Notes and the 2024 Notes will be reported as discount to the 2020 Notes and the 2024 Notes, respectively.  We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the debt discount (non-cash interest) and the instrument’s cash interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2020 Notes and/or the 2024 Notes.Future sales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our common stock.Sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.  We also have several institutional shareholders that own significant blocks of our common stock.  If one or more of these shareholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.Under certain circumstances, shares of our common stock could be issued upon conversion of the 2020 Notes and/or the 2024 Notes, which would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.  In addition, the issuance of additional common stock, or issuances of securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock or other equity linked securities, including preferred stock or warrants, would dilute the ownership interest of our common shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.If securities or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business.  If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline"
9,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2019-02-21,"     RISK FACTORS. We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.Risks Related to Our BusinessOur plans to license handset manufacturers in China may be adversely affected by a deterioration in United States-China trade and geopolitical relations, our customers facing economic uncertainty there or our failure to establish a positive reputation in China, which could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.Companies headquartered in China currently comprise a substantial portion of the handset manufacturers that remain unlicensed to our patent portfolio.  Our ability to license such manufacturers is, among other things, affected by the macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as well as our business relationships and perceived reputation in China.  The U.S. and Chinese governments are currently engaged in trade negotiations, and the U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory in 11Table of ContentsJanuary 2019 that advises U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution in China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws.  This travel advisory and other security concerns are restricting our ability to conduct in-person negotiations with prospective Chinese licensees.  If the U.S.-China trade dispute escalates or relations between the United States and China further deteriorate, these conditions could adversely affect our ability to license our patent portfolio to Chinese handset manufacturers.  Our ability to license such manufacturers could also be affected by economic uncertainty, particularly in the handset market, in China or by our failure to establish a positive reputation and relationships in China.  The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements with Chinese handset manufacturers, which, in turn, could cause our long-term business, financial condition and operating results to be materially adversely affected.Potential patent and litigation reform legislation, potential USPTO and international patent rule changes, potential legislation affecting mechanisms for patent enforcement and available remedies, and potential changes to the intellectual property rights (“IPR”) policies of worldwide standards bodies, as well as rulings in legal proceedings, may affect our investments in research and development and our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and could have a material adverse effect on our licensing business as well as our business as a whole.     Potential changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our research and development investments, patent prosecution costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure, the number of forums in which we can seek to enforce our patents, the remedies that we may be entitled to in patent litigation, and attorneys’ fees or other remedies that could be sought against us, and may require us to reevaluate and modify our research and development activities and patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies.  Similarly, legislation designed to reduce the jurisdiction and remedial authority of the United States International Trade Commission (the “USITC”) has periodically been introduced in Congress.Any potential changes in the law, the IPR policies of standards bodies or other developments that reduce the number of forums available or the type of relief available in such forums (such as injunctive relief), restrict permissible licensing practices (such as our ability to license on a worldwide portfolio basis) or that otherwise cause us to seek alternative forums (such as arbitration or state court), would make it more difficult for us to enforce our patents, whether in adversarial proceedings or in negotiations.  Because we have historically depended on the availability of certain forms of legal process to enforce our patents and obtain fair and adequate compensation for our investments in research and development and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, developments that undermine our ability to do so could have a negative impact on future licensing efforts.Rulings in our legal proceedings as well as those of third parties may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement.  For example, in recent years, the USITC and U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have taken some actions that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees, including the Company.  Decisions that occur in U.S. or in international forums may change the law applicable to various patent law issues, such as, for example, patentability, validity, claim construction, patent exhaustion, patent misuse, permissible licensing practices, available forums, and remedies such as damages and injunctive relief, in ways that are detrimental to the abilities of patentees to enforce patents and obtain suitable relief.We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.Royalty rates, or other terms, under our patent license agreements could be subject to determination through arbitration or other third-party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings, and arbitrators, judges or other third-party adjudicators or regulators could determine that our patent royalty rates should be at levels lower than our agreed or historical rates or otherwise make determinations resulting in less favorable terms and conditions under our patent license agreements.Historically, the terms of our patent license agreements, including our royalty rates, have been reached through arms-length bilateral negotiations with our licensees. We could agree, as we did with Huawei pursuant to our December 2013 settlement agreement, to have royalty rates, or other terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators) and it is also possible that courts or regulators could decide to set or otherwise determine the FRAND consistency of such terms or the manner in which such terms are determined, including by determining a worldwide royalty rate for our standards-essential patents. Changes to or clarifications of our obligations to be prepared to offer licenses to standards-essential patents on FRAND terms and conditions could require such terms, including our royalty rates, to be determined through third party adjudications. Finally, certain of our current and prospective licensees have instigated, and others could in the future instigate, legal proceedings or regulatory proceedings requesting third party adjudicators or regulators, such as the Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court, China's National Development and Reform Commission and Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission, to set FRAND terms and conditions for, or determine the FRAND-consistency of current terms and conditions in, our patent license agreements, and which could result in such third party adjudicators or regulators determining a worldwide royalty rate for our standards-essential patents. To the extent that our patent royalty rates for our patent license agreements are determined through 12Table of Contentsarbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory or court proceedings rather than through bilateral negotiations, because such proceedings are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and there are currently few precedents for such determinations, it is possible that royalty rates may be lower than our historical rates, and this could also have a negative impact on royalties we are able to obtain from future licensees, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.  In addition, to the extent that other terms and conditions for our patent license agreements are determined through such means, such terms and conditions could be less favorable than our historical terms and conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our licensing business. Due to the nature of our business, we could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights and to defend our licensing practices.While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying users and potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import or use products, we have in the past commenced, and may in the future, commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we have faced, and could continue to face, counterclaims and other legal proceedings that challenge the essential nature of our patents, or that claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  Litigation adversaries may allege that we have not complied with certain commitments to standards-setting organizations and therefore that we are not entitled to the relief that we seek.  For example, a party may allege that we have not complied with an obligation to offer a license to a party on FRAND terms and conditions, and may also file antitrust claims, unfair competition claims or regulatory complaints on that or other bases, and may seek damages and other relief based on such claims.  Litigation adversaries have also filed against us, and other third parties may in the future file, validity challenges such as inter partes proceedings in the USPTO, which can lead to delays of our patent infringement actions as well as potential findings of invalidity.Litigation may be also required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others.Third parties could commence litigation against us seeking to invalidate our patents or obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential, are invalid or are unenforceable.  In addition, current and prospective licensees have initiated proceedings against us claiming, and others in the future may claim, that we have not complied with our FRAND licensing commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities.The cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property and of defending our licensing practices has been and may continue to be significant.  As a result, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including in certain jurisdictions the costs and fees of opposing counsel if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.Setbacks in defending our patent licensing practices could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline and could have an adverse effect on our licensing business.Adverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions relating to our licensing practices, including, but not limited to, findings that we have not complied with our FRAND commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities or that any of our license agreements are void or unenforceable, could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and revenue.  Regulatory bodies may assess fines in the event of adverse findings, and as part of court or arbitration proceedings, a judgment could require us to pay damages (including the possibility of treble damages for antitrust claims).  In addition, to the extent that legal decisions find patent license agreements to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, that could lead to a decrease in the revenue associated with and cash flow generated by such agreements, and, depending on the damages requested, could lead to the refund of certain payments already made.  Finally, adverse legal decisions related to our licensing practices could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements, which, in turn, could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline.Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements due to downward product pricing pressures and competition over patent royalties.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless and consumer electronics industries, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates and/or that such rates should be applied to royalty bases smaller than the selling price of an end product (such as the “smallest salable patent practicing unit”). There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on 13Table of Contentscertain wireless products, including handsets, and other consumer electronics devices that we believe implement our patented inventions, and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of these devices. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products we aim to license. Demands by certain licensees to reduce royalties due to pricing pressure or the number of patent holders seeking royalties on these technologies, could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow.Our plans to broaden our revenue opportunities through acquiring or developing technology in new or expanded areas, such as technologies in the consumer electronics and IoT spaces, and enhanced intellectual property sourcing and joint ventures, may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to broaden our revenue opportunities through targeted acquisitions, research partnerships, joint ventures and the continued development of new technologies, such as our binding offer to acquire Technicolor SA's Research & Innovation unit.  Increasingly, our future growth in part depends on developing or acquiring technology in new or expanded areas that are used on cellular devices (such as video coding technologies) and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries (such as other consumer electronics devices and the IoT, including the connected home and smart cities, automotive, mobile computing, mobile health and sensor technology), and on third parties incorporating our technology and solutions into device types used in these areas and industry segments.  There is no guarantee that we will succeed in acquiring or developing technology and patents or partnering with inventors and research organizations to create new revenue opportunities and/or add new dimensions to our existing portfolio of intellectual property and potentially create new patent licensing programs. Also, our development activities may experience delays, which could reduce our opportunities for patent licensing or other avenues of revenue generation related to such development activities. In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Some third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot ensure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity, infringement, enforceability or scope of our patents and/or any successful design-around of our patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise, and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.Our technologies may not become patented, adopted by wireless standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced technology and related solutions.  However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G, 5G and beyond, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities.  There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future.  Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and adopted by the relevant standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed.  Competing technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop.  In addition, it is possible that in certain technology areas, such as in the IoT space, the adoption of proprietary systems could compete with or replace standards-based technology.  It is also possible in certain technology areas, such as video coding and the IoT, that open source solutions such as AV1 and OCF, respectively, could compete with or replace proprietary standards-based technology.  If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant standards, or are not adopted by and deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods we expect, or in the case of open source solutions, do not infringe our technology, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.Delays in renewing or an inability to renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Many of our license agreements have fixed terms.  Although we endeavor to renew license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before the expiration of the license agreement, on acceptable terms after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all.  If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue 14Table of Contentsfrom that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, we could lose existing licensees, and our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.Increased scrutiny by antitrust authorities may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business and/or lead to monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions.Domestic and foreign antitrust authorities have increased their scrutiny of the use of standards-essential patents in the mobile wireless industry, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors and others.  Such scrutiny has already resulted in enforcement actions against Qualcomm and could lead to additional investigations of, or enforcement actions against, the Company.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation.  Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could also result in monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.Our commercialization, licensing and/or mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activities could lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could materially adversely affect our business.The legal doctrines of patent exhaustion and implied license may be subject to different judicial interpretations.  Our commercialization or licensing of certain technologies and/or our M&A activities could potentially lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could adversely affect our patent licensing program(s) and limit our ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under such program(s).  In the event of successful challenges by current or prospective licensees based on these doctrines that result in a material decrease to our patent licensing revenue, our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.We may experience difficulties or delays integrating, and may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the integration of, the patent licensing business that we acquired from Technicolor in 2018 and, if consummated, the Research & Innovation unit of Technicolor with respect to which we made a binding offer to purchase (the “Technicolor business”).We may experience difficulties integrating the Technicolor business, or may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our integration of the Technicolor business on a timely basis, or at all, for a variety of reasons, including the following:•failure of the acquisitions to materially increase the value of our core handset licensing business by not increasing the royalty amount we would otherwise derive on each handset, not accelerating the pace of licensing, or not allowing us to avoid litigation to protect our intellectual property;•unexpected costs and strain on our resources and potential distraction of management arising from our attempts to integrate the Technicolor business;•difficulties integrating the patent portfolios and related portfolio management systems of the businesses, or migrating the portfolios to a new patent management system, and the risk that the patent assets could be negatively affected;•failure to continue to develop and expand our portfolio of video technology patent assets;•failure to develop a successful business plan and licensing program related to consumer electronics;•difficulties integrating the personnel of the Technicolor business into our operations, organization, and human resources programs, and the risk that we could lose key employees;•challenges associated with managing a geographically remote business;•failure to forecast accurately the long-term value and costs of the Technicolor business or of certain assets acquired in the transactions;•liabilities that are not covered by, or exceed the coverage under, the indemnification or other provisions of the acquisition-related agreements; and•patent validity, infringement, exhaustion or enforcement issues not uncovered during our diligence process.In the event that we experience significant integration difficulties or delays, or fail to realize the anticipated benefits from the integration, our business and results of operations, and our stock price, may be adversely affected.We have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions or engage in other strategic transactions that could result in significant changes, costs and/or management disruption and that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future acquire companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions.  Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may increase our costs, including 15Table of Contentsbut not limited to accounting and legal fees, and may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or of any technologies we may acquire.Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the acquired companies, businesses and/or assets in an efficient and effective manner.  The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, including, among others: successfully integrating new employees, technology and/or products; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.  As a result, we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully.In addition, we cannot be certain that the integration of acquired companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits we anticipate will be realized from such acquisitions.  Our plans to integrate and/or expand upon research and development programs and technologies obtained through acquisitions may result in products or technologies that are not adopted by the market, or the market may adopt solutions competitive to our products or technologies.  We may not derive any commercial value from the acquired technology or intellectual property or from future technologies or products based on the acquired technology and/or intellectual property.  In addition, to the extent we are separately seeking a patent license from a customer or customers of an acquired entity, the acquired entity may lose such customers.  Following the completion of the acquisition, we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by, or exceed the coverage under, the indemnification protection we may obtain, and we may encounter patent validity, infringement or enforcement issues or unforeseen expenses not uncovered during our diligence process.  Any acquired company or business would be subject to its own risks that may or may not be the same as the risks already disclosed herein.Challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements.  One of the most significant challenges we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions.  As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them.  The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense.  Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time.  Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot ensure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline.  The length of time required to negotiate a license agreement also leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.In addition, as discussed more fully above in these Risk Factors
, we are currently operating in a challenging regulatory and judicial environment, which may, under certain circumstances, lead to delays in the negotiation of and entry into new patent license agreements.   Also, as discussed above in these Risk Factors
 and in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K, we are also currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings with potential licensees, with whom we do not yet have a patent license agreement.  Any such delays in the negotiation or entry into new patent license agreements and receipt of the associated revenue stream could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Our revenues are derived primarily from a limited number of licensees or customers.We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees or customers for the foreseeable future.  For example, in 2018, Apple, Samsung and LG Electronics accounted for approximately 36%, 25% and 10% of our total revenues, respectively.  In the event that we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements upon expiration, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, in the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations (for example, due to a credit issue or in connection with a legal dispute or similar proceeding) under their respective license agreements, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, in the event that there is a material decrease in shipments of licensed products by one of our per-unit licensees, our revenues from such licensee could significantly decline and our future revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected.Our strategy to diversify our patent-based revenue by pursuing alternative patent licensing arrangements and patent sales may not be successful.There is no guarantee that we will succeed in our pursuit of select patent licensing arrangements or patent sales, and, if we are successful, there is no guarantee that the revenue and cash flow generated through such alternative licensing arrangements (such as the Signal Trust and the Avanci licensing platform) or patent sales will be greater than the revenue and 16Table of Contentscash flow we would have generated if we had retained and/or licensed the patents ourselves. In addition, potential licensees may be reluctant to enter into new patent license agreements, and current licensees may be reluctant to renew their agreements, either at all or on terms acceptable to the Company, based on the fact that we have sold portions of our patent portfolio or the belief that we plan to sell or transfer some of the patents we are asking them to license.A portion of our revenue and cash flow are dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A portion of our licensing revenues is running royalty-based and dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global, regional and/or country-specific economic conditions, country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, buying patterns of end users, which are often driven by replacement and innovation cycles, competition for our licensees' products and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products.  In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our products or technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect, (ii) a decline in the financial condition of any licensee or (iii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global or regional economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies or otherwise.  It is also difficult to predict the timing, nature and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement and new licenses, strategic relationships and the resolution of legal proceedings.  The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition.  In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for upfront fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees.  As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period.  Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.Our revenue may be affected by the deployment of future-generation wireless standards in place of 3G, 4G and 5G technologies or future-generation video standards, by the timing of such deployment, or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.Although we own an evolving portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G and 5G cellular technologies and non-cellular technologies including video coding technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program for future-generation wireless standards or video coding standards may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our current licensing programs.  Although we continue to participate in worldwide standards bodies and contribute our intellectual property to future-generation wireless and video coding standards, including standards that will define 5G, our technologies might not be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, we may not be as successful in the licensing of future-generation products as we have been in licensing products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards, or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such products that is comparable to that which we have historically received on products deploying existing wireless and video coding standards.  Furthermore, if there is a delay in the standardization and/or deployment of 5G or future video coding standards, our business and revenue could be negatively impacted.The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designed to operate in accordance with specified technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or anticipated to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement.  Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us.  We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees.  We may not be able to extend or modify these license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, on financial terms acceptable to us, without affecting the other material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees or at all.  Further, such extensions, modifications or new license agreements may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to any extension, modification or new license.We face risks from doing business and maintaining offices in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees, potential licensees and customers are international, and our licensees, potential licensees and customers sell their products to markets throughout the world.  In addition, in recent years, we have expanded, and we may continue to expand, our international operations, opening offices in France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, China, Belgium and Germany.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties of operating internationally and could be affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; biased enforcement of foreign laws and regulations to promote industrial or economic policies at our expense; currency control regulations and variability in the value 17Table of Contentsof the U.S. dollar against foreign currency; export license requirements and restrictions on the use of technology; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments; foreign labor regulations; anti-corruption laws; and difficulty in staffing and managing operations remotely.  In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees, potential licensees and customers do business.We depend on key senior management, engineering, patent and licensing resources.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, as well as on our ability to put in place adequate succession plans for such key personnel, and/or organizational strategies related to the departure of such key personnel.  Our success also depends in part on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized patent, licensing, engineering and other skills.  The market for such talent in our industry is extremely competitive.  In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and with significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface technologies, as well as video coding technologies.  Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions in any litigation, arbitration or regulatory proceeding, by our ability to offer competitive cash and equity compensation and work environment conditions and by the geographic location of our various offices.  The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience or to have in place adequate succession plans and/or organizational strategies related to the departure of certain key personnel could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements and undertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as our ability to meet our strategic objectives.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements.  Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable.  The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.Concentration and consolidation in the wireless communications industry could adversely affect our business.There is some concentration among participants in the wireless communications industry, and the industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses, and these trends may continue.  For example, in 2018, Samsung, Apple and Huawei collectively accounted for approximately 40% of worldwide shipments of 3G and 4G handsets and close to 50% of worldwide smartphone shipments.  Any further concentration or sale within the wireless industry among handset providers and/or original design manufacturers (""ODMs"") may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations.  We may also face a reduction in the number of licensing opportunities or existing royalty obligations as a result of government-imposed bans or other restrictions on the importation, manufacture and/or sale of cellular handsets by certain companies.  In addition, acquisitions of or consolidation among ODMs could cause handset providers who outsource manufacturing to make supply chain changes, which in turn could result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations (for example, if manufacturing is moved from an ODM with which we have a patent license agreement to an ODM with which we do not).  Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.Our use of open source software could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.Certain of our technology and our suppliers’ technology may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions.  Licensing of such technology may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software.  For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for derivative works available or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different from what we customarily use to license our technology.  While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that, if we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our technology, discontinue the sale of our technology, release the source code of our proprietary technology to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  There is a risk that open source licenses could be 18Table of Contentsconstrued in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.Changes to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.  We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding.  Pursuant to the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued.  As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Changes in financial accounting standards or policies may affect our reported financial condition or results of operations and, in certain cases, could cause a decline and/or fluctuations in the price of our common stock.From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") change their guidance governing the form and content of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), such as the FASB and the SEC, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions with regard to how these standards should be applied.  A change in accounting principles or their interpretation can have a significant effect on our reported results.  In certain cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently.  Potential changes in reporting standards could substantially change our reporting practices in a number of areas, including revenue recognition and recording of assets and liabilities, and affect our reported financial condition or results of operations.For example, in May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board issued revenue guidance, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, that the Company has adopted effective January 1, 2018, which impacts our recognition of revenue from both our fixed-fee and per-unit license agreements.  Refer to Note 3, ""Revenue Recognition,"" in the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this adoption.  Such changes to our reporting practices could significantly affect our reported financial condition and results of operations going forward, causing the amount of revenue we recognize to vary dramatically from quarter to quarter, and even year to year, depending on the timing of entry into license agreements and whether such agreements are dynamic or static fixed-fee agreements or have per-unit royalty terms.  In addition, these changes to our reporting practices and the resulting fluctuations in our reported revenue could cause a decline and/or fluctuations in the price of our common stock.The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers, as well as the cost of new handsets could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is partially dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services and cellular handsets that utilize our technology.  In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies.  The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services.  Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers.  The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks.  Growth in the number of cellular handsets may slow as the number of people worldwide without a cellular handset declines.  In addition, if the cost of cellular handsets increases, customers may be less likely to replace their existing devices with new devices.  The growth of our business could be adversely affected if either of these events occur.Market projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.  The validity of their and our assumptions, the 19Table of Contentstiming and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions.  In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate.  The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our products and solutions that we may market or set forth into the standards-setting arena.  Due to competing products and solutions, our products and solutions may not find a viable commercial marketplace or, where applicable, be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold essential patents, for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain product or products.  In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property.  To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.Our engineering services business could subject us to specific costs and risks that we might fail to manage adequately.We derive a portion of our revenues from engineering services.  Any mismanagement of, or negative development in, a number of areas, including, among others, the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under our service contracts, could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline, damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract future licensees, which would in turn harm our operating results.  If we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts, we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract.  We need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues.  Our failure to monitor these services adequately may harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.We may experience difficulties with our new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system.In first quarter 2018, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team.  We have committed significant resources to this new system, and realizing the full functionality of the system is complex.  As a result of the conversion process, we may experience delays or disruptions in the integration of our new systems, procedures or controls.  We may also encounter errors in data and security or technical reliability issues.  Significant system failures could lead to a delay or error in recording and reporting financial information on a timely and accurate basis or impact our internal control compliance efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our per-unit licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.    The standard terms of our per-unit license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis.  Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute.  From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end.Our plans to expand our revenue opportunities through commercializing our market-ready technologies and acquiring and/or developing new technology with commercial applicability may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to expand our revenue opportunities through the continued development, commercialization and licensing of technology projects, including in the IoT space.  Our technology development and acquisition activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, if at all, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing.  In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect.  Technology markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, infrastructure improvements.  Additionally, investing in technology development is costly and may require structural changes to the organization that could require additional costs, including without limitation legal and accounting fees.  Furthermore, delays or failures to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate technology development efforts and secure support for our technologies or delays or failures to enter into technology licensing agreements 20Table of Contentsto secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows, or decrease our ability to remain competitive.We have in the past and may in the future make investments that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future make investments in other entities by purchasing minority equity interests or corporate bonds/notes in publicly traded or privately held companies.  Most strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and may not become liquid for a period of time, if ever.  In some cases, strategic investments may serve as consideration for a license in lieu of cash royalties.  In addition, other investments may not generate financial returns or may result in losses due to market volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. We have made in the past and may make in the future strategic investments in early-stage companies, which may require us to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of those companies.  Our share of any such losses may adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments.Our investments in new commercial initiatives may not be successful or generate meaningful revenues.We have invested, and may continue to invest, in new businesses focused on commercializing technology that we have developed, incubated internally and/or acquired, such as video coding technology and other technologies for use on consumer electronics devices.  Commercial success depends on many factors, including the demand for the technology, the highly competitive markets for our technology products, regulatory issues associated with such technology products, and effective marketing and licensing or product sales.  In addition, our new technology offerings may require robust ecosystems of customers and service providers that may fail to materialize.  Further, the establishment and operation of these commercial initiatives requires significant support, including technical, legal and financial resources.  It is possible that these commercial initiatives will not be successful and/or will not achieve meaningful revenues for a number of years, if at all.  Further, we may attempt to develop technologies or services that we believe we would be able to sell or license commercially using inside or outside technical, legal and financial resources.  If our new commercial initiatives are not successful, or are not successful in the timeframe we anticipate, we may incur significant costs, our business may not grow as anticipated and/or our reputation may be harmed.  In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.We may be subject to warranty and/or product liability claims with respect to our products, which could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could expose us to loss and reputational damage.We may be subject to claims if customers of our product offerings are injured or experience failures or other quality issues.  We may from time to time be subject to warranty and product liability claims with regard to product performance and our services.  We could incur losses as a result of warranty, support, repair or replacement costs in response to customer complaints or in connection with the resolution of contemplated or actual legal proceedings relating to such claims.  In addition to potential losses arising from claims and related legal proceedings, warranty and product liability claims could affect our reputation and our relationship with customers.Our technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies.  Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the marketplace or in the standards setting arena.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful.  Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected.  In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants.  Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.Our business may be adversely affected if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights with respect to products and/or solutions that we sell or license.Third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights with respect to products and/or solutions we sell or license.  Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming 21Table of Contentsand costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business.  Furthermore, third parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could block our ability to further develop or commercialize some of our technologies or services in the United States and abroad and could cause us to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our products.  Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards.  Even if we have an agreement that provides for a third party to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to perform its contractual obligations.  If we cannot use valid intellectual property that we infringe at all or on reasonable terms, or substitute similar non-infringing technology from another source, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our activities and international strategic investments.We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which may change over time as our business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.  We operate and invest globally.  Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings.  Our exposure to foreign currencies may increase as we expand into new markets.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies.  If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.  In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.•If as a result of tax treaty procedures, the U.S. government reaches an agreement with certain foreign governments to whom we have paid foreign taxes, resulting in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits, such agreement could result in foreign currency gain or loss.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches and our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules and policies and other obligations regarding data protection.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated.  These attempts, which in some cases could be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others.  We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business or personal information (whether through a breach of our own systems or the breach of a system of a third party that provides services to us) could harm our competitive or negotiating positions, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, compromise our patent enforcement strategies or outlook, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.  In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, licensees’, or customers’ confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. We could also be affected by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.  For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) adopted by the European Commission became effective in May 2018, and China adopted a new cybersecurity law as of June 2017.  Complying with the GDPR and other existing and emerging and changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices.  Non-compliance could result in monetary penalties or significant legal liability.If wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks, demand for products of our licensees could decrease.Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate medical equipment.  Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the products of our licensees.  In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for the products of our licensees.22Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the 2020 NotesThe price of our common stock is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our common stock, and such fluctuations could continue. From January 2, 2017 to February 19, 2019, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $62.34 per share to a high of $102.30 per share. The market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:•the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC and announcements relating to licensing, technology development, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and intellectual property impacting us or our business;•announcements concerning strategic transactions, such as commercial initiatives, joint ventures, strategic investments, acquisitions or divestitures;•financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;•changes in GAAP, including new accounting standards that may materially affect our revenue recognition;•changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;•investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-term goals;•changes in market share of significant licensees;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other wireless communications companies generally; and•market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole.In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $334.4 million, inclusive of debt resulting from the Technicolor Acquisition that was completed in third quarter 2018 (refer to Note 5, ""Business Combinations,"" in the consolidated financial statements for further information).  This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our 1.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the ""2020 Notes"");•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes.Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the 2020 Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes and to fund other liquidity needs.  If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the 2020 Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other currently existing or future outstanding indebtedness.Our shareholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.23Table of ContentsOur current dividend policy contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share on our outstanding common stock.  We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy.  However, the dividend policy and the payment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.  Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future.  Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.If securities or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business.  If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the 2020 Notes may affect the value of the 2020 Notes and the market price of our common stock.In connection with each offering of the 2020 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) and sold warrants to the option counterparties.  These transactions will be accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity.  The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the 2020 Notes.  The warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.In connection with establishing their initial hedge of these transactions, the option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) purchased our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions and/or entered various cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the 2020 Notes.  These activities could have the effect of increasing (or reducing the size of any decrease in) the price of our common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the 2020 Notes.  In addition, the option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may modify their respective hedge positions from time to time (including during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2020 Notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions.The potential effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Future sales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our common stock.Sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.  We also have several institutional shareholders that own significant blocks of our common stock.  If one or more of these shareholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.Under certain circumstances, shares of our common stock could be issued upon conversion of the 2020 Notes, which would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.  In addition, the issuance of additional common stock, or issuances of securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock or other equity linked securities, including preferred stock or warrants, would dilute the ownership interest of our common shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.Approved stock repurchase programs may not result in a positive return of capital to shareholders.Our board-approved stock repurchase program may not return value to shareholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock.  Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver shareholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.24Table of ContentsProvisions of the 2020 Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the 2020 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their 2020 Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such 2020 Notes in integral multiples of $1,000.  We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions.  These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that the option counterparties may default under the respective convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral.  Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions.  If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transactions.  Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock.  In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock.  We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.The accounting method for convertible debt securities, such as the 2020 Notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.In May 2008, the FASB, issued ASC 470-20.  Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments, such as the 2020 Notes, that may be settled partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost.  ASC 470-20 requires the fair value of the conversion option of the 2020 Notes be reported as a component of shareholders’ equity and included in the additional paid-in-capital on our consolidated balance sheet.  The value of the conversion option of the 2020 Notes will be reported as discount to the 2020 Notes.  We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the debt discount (non-cash interest) and the instrument’s cash interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2020 Notes"
11,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2018-02-22,"     RISK FACTORS. We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.Risks Related to Our BusinessPotential patent and litigation reform legislation, potential USPTO and international patent rule changes, potential legislation affecting mechanisms for patent enforcement and available remedies, and potential changes to the intellectual property rights (“IPR”) policies of worldwide standards bodies, as well as rulings in legal proceedings, may affect our investments in research and development and our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and could have a material adverse effect on our licensing business as well as our business as a whole.     Potential changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our research and development investments, patent prosecution costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure, the number of forums in which we can seek to enforce our patents, the remedies that we may be entitled to in patent litigation, and attorneys’ fees or other remedies that could be sought against us, and may require us to reevaluate and modify our research and development activities and patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies.  Similarly, legislation designed to reduce the jurisdiction and remedial authority of the United States International Trade Commission (the “USITC”) has periodically been introduced in Congress.Any potential changes in the law, the IPR policies of standards bodies or other developments that reduce the number of forums available or the type of relief available in such forums (such as injunctive relief), restrict permissible licensing practices (such as our ability to license on a worldwide portfolio basis) or that otherwise cause us to seek alternative forums (such as arbitration or state court), would make it more difficult for us to enforce our patents, whether in adversarial proceedings or in negotiations.  Because we have historically depended on the availability of certain forms of legal process to enforce our patents and obtain fair and adequate compensation for our investments in research and development and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, developments that undermine our ability to do so could have a negative impact on future licensing efforts.Rulings in our legal proceedings as well as those of third parties may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement.  For example, in recent years, the USITC and U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have taken some actions that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees, including the Company.  Decisions that occur in U.S. or in international forums may change the law applicable to various patent law issues, such as, for example, patentability, validity, claim construction, patent exhaustion, patent misuse, permissible licensing practices, available forums, and remedies such as damages and injunctive relief, in ways that are detrimental to the abilities of patentees to enforce patents and obtain suitable relief.We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.Setbacks in defending our patent licensing practices could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline and could have an adverse effect on our licensing business.Adverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions relating to our licensing practices, including, but not limited to, findings that we have not complied with our FRAND commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities or that any of our license agreements are void or unenforceable, could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and revenue.  Regulatory bodies may assess fines in the event of adverse findings, and in court or arbitration proceedings, an adverse decision could lead to a judgment requiring us to pay damages (including the possibility of treble damages for antitrust 10Table of Contentsclaims).  In addition, to the extent that legal decisions find patent license agreements to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, that could lead to a decrease in the revenue associated with and cash flow generated by such agreements, and, depending on the damages requested, could lead to the refund of certain payments already made.  Finally, adverse legal decisions related to our licensing practices could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into license agreements, which, in turn, could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline.Our plans to broaden our revenue opportunities through acquiring or developing technology in new or expanded areas, such as technologies in the IoT space, and enhanced intellectual property sourcing and joint ventures, may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to broaden our revenue opportunities through targeted acquisitions, research partnerships, joint ventures and the continued development of new technologies.  Increasingly, our future growth in part depends on developing or acquiring technology in new or expanded areas and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries (such as the IoT, including the connected home and smart cities, automotive, mobile computing, mobile health and sensor technology), and on third parties incorporating our technology and solutions into device types used in these areas and industry segments.  There is no guarantee that we will succeed in acquiring or developing technology and patents or partnering with inventors and research organizations to create new revenue opportunities and/or add new dimensions to our existing portfolio of intellectual property and potentially create new patent licensing programs. Also, our development activities may experience delays, which could reduce our opportunities for patent licensing or other avenues of revenue generation related to such development activities. In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Some third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot ensure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity, infringement, enforceability or scope of our patents and/or any successful design-around of our patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise, and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.Royalty rates, or other terms, under our patent license agreements could be subject to determination through arbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory proceedings, and arbitrators or other third party adjudicators or regulators could determine that our patent royalty rates should be at levels lower than our agreed or historical rates or otherwise make determinations resulting in less favorable terms and conditions under our patent license agreements.Historically, the terms of our patent license agreements, including our royalty rates, have been reached through arms-length bilateral negotiations with our licensees. We could agree, as we did with Huawei pursuant to our December 2013 settlement agreement, to have royalty rates, or other terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators) and it is also possible that courts or regulators could decide to set or otherwise determine the fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) consistency of such terms or the manner in which such terms are determined. Changes to or clarifications of our obligations to be prepared to offer licenses to standards-essential patents on FRAND terms and conditions could require such terms, including our royalty rates, to be determined through third party adjudications. Finally, certain of our current and prospective licensees have instigated, and others could in the future instigate, legal proceedings or regulatory proceedings requesting third party adjudicators or regulators, such as China's National Development and Reform Commission and Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission, to set FRAND terms and conditions for, or determine the FRAND-consistency of current terms and conditions in, our patent license agreements. To the extent that our patent royalty rates for our patent license agreements are determined through arbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory proceedings rather than through bilateral negotiations, because such proceedings are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and there are currently few precedents for such determinations, it is possible that royalty rates may be lower than our agreed or historical rates, and this could also have a negative impact on royalties we are able to obtain from future licensees, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.  In addition, to the extent that other terms and conditions for our patent license agreements are determined through such means, such terms and conditions could be less favorable than our historical terms and conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our licensing business. Due to the nature of our business, we could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights and to defend our licensing practices.11Table of ContentsWhile some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying users and potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import or use products, we have in the past commenced, and may in the future, commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we have faced, and could continue to face, counterclaims and other legal proceedings that challenge the essential nature of our patents, or that claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  Litigation adversaries may allege that we have not complied with certain commitments to standards-setting organizations and therefore that we are not entitled to the relief that we seek.  For example, a party may allege that we have not complied with an obligation to offer a license to a party on FRAND terms and conditions, and may also file antitrust claims, unfair competition claims or regulatory complaints on that or other bases, and may seek damages and other relief based on such claims.  Litigation adversaries have also filed against us, and other third parties may in the future file, validity challenges such as inter partes proceedings in the USPTO, which can lead to delays of our patent infringement actions as well as potential findings of invalidity.Litigation may be also required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others.Third parties could commence litigation against us seeking to invalidate our patents or obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential, are invalid or are unenforceable.  In addition, current and prospective licensees have initiated proceedings against us claiming, and others in the future may claim, that we have not complied with our FRAND licensing commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities.The cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property and of defending our licensing practices has been and may continue to be significant.  As a result, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including in certain jurisdictions the costs and fees of opposing counsel if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.Our commercialization, licensing and/or mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activities could lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could materially adversely affect our business.The legal doctrines of patent exhaustion and implied license may be subject to different judicial interpretations.  Our commercialization or licensing of certain technologies and/or our M&A activities could potentially lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could adversely affect our patent licensing program(s) and limit our ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under such program(s).  In the event of successful challenges by current or prospective licensees based on these doctrines that result in a material decrease to our patent licensing revenue, our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements due to downward product pricing pressures and competition over a finite pool of patent royalties.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless industry, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates and/or that such rates should be applied to royalty bases smaller than the selling price of an end product (such as the “smallest salable patent practicing unit”). There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain wireless products, including handsets, that we believe implement our patented inventions, and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of handsets. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products for the cellular market. Demands by certain licensees to reduce royalties due to pricing pressure or the number of patent holders seeking royalties on their cellular technologies, could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow.Increased scrutiny by antitrust authorities may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business and/or lead to monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions.Domestic and foreign antitrust authorities have increased their scrutiny of the use of standards-essential patents in the mobile wireless industry, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors and others. Such scrutiny has resulted in, and may lead to additional, inquiries that may lead to enforcement actions against the Company and/or impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation. Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could result in monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.12Table of ContentsOur technologies may not become patented, adopted by wireless standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced technology and related solutions. However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G, 5G and beyond, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities. There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future. Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and adopted by the relevant standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed. Competing technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop.  In addition, it is possible that in certain technology areas, such as in the IoT space, the adoption of proprietary systems could compete with or replace standards-based technology.  If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant standards or are not adopted by and deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods we expect, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.We have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions or engage in other strategic transactions that could result in significant changes, costs and/or management disruption and that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future acquire companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions.  Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may increase our costs, including but not limited to accounting and legal fees, and may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or of any technologies we may acquire.Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the acquired companies, businesses and/or assets in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, including, among others: successfully integrating new employees, technology and/or products; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.  As a result, we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully.In addition, we cannot be certain that the integration of acquired companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits we anticipate to result from such acquisitions.  Our plans to integrate and/or expand upon research and development programs and technologies obtained through acquisitions may result in products or technologies that are not adopted by the market, or the market may adopt solutions competitive to our products or technologies.  We may not derive any commercial value from the acquired technology or intellectual property or from future technologies or products based on the acquired technology and/or intellectual property. In addition, to the extent we are separately seeking a patent license from a customer or customers of an acquired entity, the acquired entity may lose such customers.  Following the completion of the acquisition, we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by, or exceed the coverage under, the indemnification protection we may obtain, and we may encounter patent validity, infringement or enforcement issues or unforeseen expenses not uncovered during our diligence process.  Any acquired company or business would be subject to its own risks that may or may not be the same as the risks already disclosed herein.We have in the past and may in the future make investments that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future make investments in other entities by purchasing minority equity interests or corporate bonds/notes in publicly traded or privately held companies.  Most strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and may not become liquid for a period of time, if ever.  In some cases, strategic investments may serve as consideration for a license in lieu of cash royalties.  In addition, other investments may not generate financial returns or may result in losses due to market volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. We have made in the past and may make in the future strategic investments in early-stage companies, which require us to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of those companies. Our share of any such losses may adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments.Challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements. One of the most significant challenges we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions. As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them. The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and 13Table of Contentsexpense. Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time. Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot ensure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline. The length of time required to negotiate a license agreement also leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.In addition, as discussed more fully above in these Risk Factors
, we are currently operating in a challenging regulatory and judicial environment, which may, under certain circumstances, lead to delays in the negotiation of and entry into new patent license agreements.   Also, as discussed below in these Risk Factors
 and in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K, we are also currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings with potential licensees, with whom we do not yet have a patent license agreement.  Any such delays in the negotiation or entry into new patent license agreements and receipt of the associated revenue stream could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Our revenues are derived primarily from a limited number of licensees or customers.We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees or customers for the foreseeable future.  For example, in 2017, Apple, Huawei and Samsung accounted for approximately 21%, 14% and 13% of our total revenues, respectively. In the event that we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements upon expiration, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, in the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations (for example, due to a credit issue or in connection with a legal dispute or similar proceeding) under their respective license agreements, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, in the event that there is a material decrease in shipments of licensed products by one of our significant per-unit licensees, our revenues from such licensee could significantly decline and our future revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected.Our plans to expand our revenue opportunities through commercializing our market-ready technologies and acquiring and/or developing new technology with commercial applicability may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to expand our revenue opportunities through the continued development, commercialization and licensing of technology projects, including in the IoT space.   Our technology development and acquisition activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, if at all, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing.  In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect.  Technology markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, infrastructure improvements.  Additionally, investing in technology development is costly and may require structural changes to the organization that could require additional costs, including without limitation legal and accounting fees.  Furthermore, delays or failures to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate technology development efforts and secure support for our technologies or delays or failures to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows, or decrease our ability to remain competitive.Our investments in new commercial initiatives may not be successful or generate meaningful revenues.We have invested, and may continue to invest, in new businesses focused on commercializing technology that we have developed, incubated internally and/or acquired.  Commercial success depends on many factors, including the demand for the technology, the highly competitive markets for our technology products, regulatory issues associated with such technology products, and effective marketing and licensing or product sales.  In addition, our new technology offerings may require robust ecosystems of customers and service providers that may fail to materialize.  Further, the establishment and operation of these commercial initiatives requires significant support, including technical, legal and financial resources.  It is possible that these commercial initiatives will not be successful and/or will not achieve meaningful revenues for a number of years, if at all.  Further, we may attempt to develop technologies or services that we believe we would be able to sell or license commercially using inside or outside technical, legal and financial resources.  If our new commercial initiatives are not successful, or are not successful in the timeframe we anticipate, we may incur significant costs, our business may not grow as anticipated and/or our reputation may be harmed.  In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.Our strategy to diversify our patent-based revenue by pursuing alternative patent licensing arrangements and patent sales may not be successful.14Table of ContentsThere is no guarantee that we will succeed in our pursuit of select patent licensing arrangements or patent sales, and, if we are successful, there is no guarantee that the revenue and cash flow generated through such alternative licensing arrangements (such as the Signal Trust and the Avanci licensing platform) or patent sales will be greater than the revenue and cash flow we would have generated if we had retained and/or licensed the patents ourselves. In addition, potential licensees may be reluctant to enter into new patent license agreements, and current licensees may be reluctant to renew their agreements, either at all or on terms acceptable to the Company, based on the fact that we have sold portions of our patent portfolio or the belief that we plan to sell or transfer some of the patents we are asking them to license.    A portion of our revenue and cash flow are dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A portion of our licensing revenues is running royalty-based and dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global, regional and/or country-specific economic conditions, country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, buying patterns of end users, which are often driven by replacement and innovation cycles, competition for our licensees' products and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products. In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our products or technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect, (ii) a decline in the financial condition of any licensee or (iii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global or regional economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies or otherwise. It is also difficult to predict the timing, nature and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement and new licenses, strategic relationships and the resolution of legal proceedings. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition. In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for upfront fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees. As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period. Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.Our revenue may be affected by the deployment of future-generation wireless standards in place of 3G and 4G technologies, by the timing of such deployment, or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.Although we own an evolving portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G and 5G cellular technologies and non-cellular technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program for future-generation wireless standards may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our current licensing programs. Although we continue to participate in worldwide standards bodies and contribute our intellectual property to future-generation wireless standards, including standards that will define 5G, our technologies might not be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, we may not be as successful in the licensing of future-generation products as we have been in licensing 3G and 4G products, or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such products that is comparable to that which we have historically received on 3G and 4G products.  Furthermore, if there is a delay in the standardization and/or deployment of 5G, our business and revenue could be negatively impacted.     The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designed to operate in accordance with specified cellular technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or anticipated to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement. Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us. We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We may not be able to extend or modify these license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, on financial terms acceptable to us, without affecting the other material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees or at all. Further, such extensions, modifications or new license agreements may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to any extension, modification or new license.Delays in renewing or an inability to renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Many of our license agreements have fixed terms. Although we endeavor to renew license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before the expiration of the license agreement, on acceptable terms after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all. If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue 15Table of Contentsfrom that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, we could lose existing licensees, and our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.We depend on key senior management, engineering, patent and licensing resources.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, as well as on our ability to put in place adequate succession plans for such key personnel, and/or organizational strategies related to the departure of such key personnel. Our success also depends in part on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized patent, licensing, engineering and other skills. The market for such talent in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and with significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface technologies. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions in any litigation, arbitration or regulatory proceeding, by our ability to offer competitive cash and equity compensation and work environment conditions and by the geographic location of our various offices. The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience or to have in place adequate succession plans and/or organizational strategies related to the departure of certain key personnel could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements and undertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as our ability to meet our strategic objectives.We may experience difficulties with our new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system.We recently implemented a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team.  We have committed significant resources to this new system, to which we converted in first quarter 2018, and realizing the full functionality of the system is complex.  As a result of the conversion process and during our initial use of the new system, we may experience delays or disruptions in the integration of our new systems, procedures or controls.  We may also encounter errors in data and security or technical reliability issues.  Significant system failures could lead to a delay or error in recording and reporting financial information on a timely and accurate basis or impact our internal control compliance efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements. Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.We face risks from doing business and maintaining offices in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees, potential licensees and customers are international, and our licensees, potential licensees and customers sell their products to markets throughout the world. In addition, in recent years, we have expanded, and we may continue to expand, our international operations, opening offices in the United Kingdom, South Korea, Belgium and Germany.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties of operating internationally and could be affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; biased enforcement of foreign laws and regulations to promote industrial or economic policies at our expense; currency control regulations and variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency; export license requirements and restrictions on the use of technology; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments; foreign labor regulations; anti-corruption laws; and difficulty in staffing and managing operations remotely. In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees, potential licensees and customers do business.    Concentration and consolidation in the wireless communications industry could adversely affect our business.There is some concentration among participants in the wireless communications industry, and the industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses, and these trends may continue.  For example, in 2017, Samsung, Apple and Huawei collectively accounted for approximately 40% of worldwide shipments of 3G and 4G handsets and for close to 50% of worldwide smartphone shipments.  Any further concentration or sale within the 16Table of Contentswireless industry among handset providers and/or original design manufacturers (""ODMs"") may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations.  In addition, acquisitions of or consolidation among ODMs could cause handset providers who outsource manufacturing to make supply chain changes, which in turn could result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations (for example, if manufacturing is moved from an ODM with which we have a patent license agreement to an ODM with which we do not).  Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.Our use of open source software could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.Certain of our technology and our suppliers’ technology may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such technology may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for derivative works available or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different from what we customarily use to license our technology. While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that, if we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our technology, discontinue the sale of our technology, release the source code of our proprietary technology to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. There is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.Changes to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding. Pursuant to the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our per-unit licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.    The standard terms of our per-unit license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end.Changes in financial accounting standards or policies may affect our reported financial condition or results of operations and, in certain cases, could cause a decline and/or fluctuations in the price of our common stock.From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") change their guidance governing the form and content of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), such as the FASB and the SEC, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions with regard to how these standards should be applied. A change in accounting principles or their interpretation can have a significant effect on our reported results. In certain cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently.  Potential changes in reporting standards could substantially change our reporting practices in a number of 17Table of Contentsareas, including revenue recognition and recording of assets and liabilities, and affect our reported financial condition or results of operations.For example, in May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board issued revenue guidance, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, that the Company has adopted effective January 1, 2018, which impacts our recognition of revenue from both our fixed-fee and per-unit license agreements. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Overview -- New Accounting Guidance.  Such changes to our reporting practices could significantly affect our reported financial condition and results of operations going forward, causing the amount of revenue we recognize to vary dramatically from quarter to quarter, and even year to year, depending on the timing of entry into license agreements and whether such agreements are dynamic or static fixed-fee agreements or have per-unit royalty terms.  In addition, these changes to our reporting practices and the resulting fluctuations in our reported revenue could cause a decline and/or fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks. The growth of our business could be adversely affected if this occurs.Market projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions. In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate. The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our products and solutions that we may market or set forth into the standards-setting arena. Due to competing products and solutions, our products and solutions may not find a viable commercial marketplace or, where applicable, be adopted by the relevant standards. In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold essential patents, for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain product or products. In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property. To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.Our technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies. Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the marketplace or in the standards setting arena. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful. Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected. In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants. Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.18Table of ContentsOur business may be adversely affected if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights with respect to products and/or solutions that we sell or license.Third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights with respect to products and/or solutions we sell or license.  Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. Furthermore, third parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could block our ability to further develop or commercialize some of our technologies or services in the United States and abroad and could cause us to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our products.  Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards. Even if we have an agreement that provides for a third party to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to perform its contractual obligations.  If we cannot use valid intellectual property that we infringe at all or on reasonable terms, or substitute similar non-infringing technology from another source, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.We may be subject to warranty and/or product liability claims with respect to our products, which could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could expose us to loss and reputational damage.We may be subject to claims if customers of our product offerings are injured or experience failures or other quality issues.  We may from time to time be subject to warranty and product liability claims with regard to product performance and our services. We could incur losses as a result of warranty, support, repair or replacement costs in response to customer complaints or in connection with the resolution of contemplated or actual legal proceedings relating to such claims. In addition to potential losses arising from claims and related legal proceedings, warranty and product liability claims could affect our reputation and our relationship with customers.Our engineering services business could subject us to specific costs and risks that we might fail to manage adequately.We derive a portion of our revenues from engineering services. Any mismanagement of, or negative development in, a number of areas, including, among others, the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under our service contracts, could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline, damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract future licensees, which would in turn harm our operating results. If we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts, we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract. We need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues. Our failure to monitor these services adequately may harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our activities and international strategic investments.We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which may change over time as our business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. We operate and invest globally. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings. Our exposure to foreign currencies may increase as we expand into new markets.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies. If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows. In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.•If as a result of tax treaty procedures, the U.S. government reaches an agreement with certain foreign governments to whom we have paid foreign taxes, resulting in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits, such agreement could result in foreign currency gain or loss.19Table of ContentsOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches and our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules and policies and other obligations regarding data protection.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated.  These attempts, which in some cases could be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business or personal information (whether through a breach of our own systems or the breach of a system of a third party that provides services to us) could harm our competitive or negotiating positions, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, compromise our patent enforcement strategies or outlook, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.  In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, licensees’, or customers’ confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. We could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.  For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) adopted by the European Commission will become effective in May 2018, and China adopted a new cybersecurity law as of June 2017.  Complying with the GDPR and other existing and emerging and changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices.  Non-compliance could result in monetary penalties or significant legal liability.If wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks, demand for products of our licensees could decrease.Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate medical equipment. Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the products of our licensees. In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for the products of our licensees.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the 2020 NotesThe price of our common stock is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our common stock, and such fluctuations could continue. From January 4, 2016 to February 21, 2018, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $41.01 per share to a high of $102.30 per share. The market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:•the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC and announcements relating to licensing, technology development, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and intellectual property impacting us or our business;•announcements concerning strategic transactions, such as commercial initiatives, joint ventures, strategic investments, acquisitions or divestitures;•financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;•changes in GAAP, including new accounting standards that may materially affect our revenue recognition;•changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;•investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-term goals;•changes in market share of significant licensees;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other wireless communications companies generally; and•market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole.In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.20Table of ContentsOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2017, was approximately $316.0 million.  This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our 1.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the ""2020 Notes"");•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes.Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the 2020 Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the 2020 Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other currently existing or future outstanding indebtedness.Our shareholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.Our current dividend policy, contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share on our outstanding common stock. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, the dividend policy and the payment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.If securities or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the 2020 Notes may affect the value of the 2020 Notes and the market price of our common stock.In connection with each offering of the 2020 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) and sold warrants to the option counterparties. These transactions will be accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the 2020 Notes. The warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.21Table of ContentsIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of these transactions, the option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) purchased our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions and/or entered various cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the 2020 Notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing (or reducing the size of any decrease in) the price of our common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the 2020 Notes. In addition, the option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may modify their respective hedge positions from time to time (including during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2020 Notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions.The potential effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Future sales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our common stock.Sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. We also have several institutional shareholders that own significant blocks of our common stock. If one or more of these shareholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.Under certain circumstances, shares of our common stock could be issued upon conversion of the 2020 Notes, which would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders. In addition, the issuance of additional common stock, or issuances of securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock or other equity linked securities, including preferred stock or warrants, would dilute the ownership interest of our common shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.Approved stock repurchase programs may not result in a positive return of capital to shareholders.Our board-approved stock repurchase program may not return value to shareholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver shareholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.Provisions of the 2020 Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the 2020 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their 2020 Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such 2020 Notes in integral multiples of $1,000. We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that the option counterparties may default under the respective convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.The accounting method for convertible debt securities, such as the 2020 Notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.In May 2008, the FASB, issued ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments, such as the 2020 Notes, that may be settled partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost.  ASC 470-20 requires the fair value of the conversion option of the 2020 Notes be reported as a component of shareholders’ equity and included in the additional paid-in-capital on our consolidated balance sheet.  The value of the conversion option of the 2020 Notes will be reported as discount to the 2020 22Table of ContentsNotes.  We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the debt discount (non-cash interest) and the instrument’s cash interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2020 Notes"
1,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2017-02-23,"     RISK FACTORS. We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.Risks Related to Our BusinessPotential patent and litigation reform legislation, potential USPTO and international patent rule changes, potential legislation affecting mechanisms for patent enforcement and available remedies, and potential changes to the intellectual property rights (“IPR”) policies of worldwide standards bodies, as well as rulings in legal proceedings may affect our investments in research and development and our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and could have a material adverse effect on our licensing business as well as our business as a whole.     Potential changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our research and development investments, patent prosecution costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure, the number of forums in which we can seek to enforce our patents, the remedies that we may be entitled to in patent litigation, and attorneys’ fees or other remedies that could be sought against us, and may require us to reevaluate and modify our research and development activities and patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies.  Similarly, legislation designed to reduce the jurisdiction and remedial authority of the United States International Trade Commission (the “USITC”)  has periodically been introduced in Congress.  Any potential changes in the law, the IPR policies of standards bodies or other developments that reduce the number of forums available or the type of relief available in such forums (such as injunctive relief), restrict permissible licensing practices (such as our ability to license on a worldwide portfolio basis) or that otherwise cause us to seek alternative forums (such as arbitration or state court), would make it more difficult for us to enforce our patents, whether in adversarial proceedings or in negotiations.  Because we have historically depended on the availability of certain forms of legal process to enforce our patents and obtain fair and adequate compensation for our investments in research and development and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, developments that undermine our ability to do so could have a negative impact on future licensing efforts.Rulings in our legal proceedings as well as those of third parties may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement.  For example, in recent years, the USITC and U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have taken some actions that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees, including the Company.  Decisions that occur in U.S. or in international forums may change the law applicable to various patent law issues, such as, for example, patentability, validity, claim construction, patent exhaustion, patent misuse, permissible licensing practices, available forums, and remedies such as damages and injunctive relief, in ways that are detrimental to the abilities of patentees to enforce patents and obtain suitable relief.We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.Increased scrutiny by antitrust authorities may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business and/or lead to monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions.Domestic and foreign antitrust authorities have increased their scrutiny of the use of standards-essential patents in the mobile wireless industry, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors and others. Such scrutiny has resulted in, and may lead to additional, inquiries that may lead to enforcement actions against the Company and/or impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation. Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could result in monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.10Table of ContentsRoyalty rates, or other terms, under our patent license agreements could be subject to determination through arbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory proceedings, and arbitrators or other third party adjudicators or regulators could determine that our patent royalty rates should be at levels lower than our agreed or historical rates or otherwise make determinations resulting in less favorable terms and conditions under our patent license agreements.Historically, the terms of our patent license agreements, including our royalty rates, have been reached through arms-length bilateral negotiations with our licensees. We could agree, as we did with Huawei pursuant to our December 2013 settlement agreement, to have royalty rates, or other terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators) and it is also possible that courts or regulators could decide to set or otherwise determine the fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) consistency of such terms or the manner in which such terms are determined. Changes to or clarifications of our obligations to be prepared to offer licenses to standards-essential patents on FRAND terms and conditions could require such terms, including our royalty rates, to be determined through third party adjudications. Finally, certain of our current and prospective licensees have already instigated, and others could in the future instigate, legal proceedings or regulatory proceedings requesting third party adjudicators or regulators, such as China's National Development and Reform Commission and Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission, to set FRAND terms and conditions for, or determine the FRAND-consistency of current terms and conditions in, our patent license agreements. To the extent that our patent royalty rates for our patent license agreements are determined through arbitration or other third party adjudications or regulatory proceedings rather than through bilateral negotiations, because such proceedings are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and there are currently few precedents for such determinations, it is possible that royalty rates may be lower than our agreed or historical rates, and this could also have a negative impact on royalties we are able to obtain from future licensees, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.  In addition, to the extent that other terms and conditions for our patent license agreements are determined through such means, such terms and conditions could be less favorable than our historical terms and conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our licensing business.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Some third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot ensure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity, infringement, enforceability or scope of our patents and/or any successful design-around of our patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise, and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.Due to the nature of our business, we could continue to be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights and to defend our licensing practices.While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying users and potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import or use products, we have in the past commenced, and may in the future, commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we have faced, and could continue to face, counterclaims and other legal proceedings that challenge the essential nature of our patents, or that claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.  Litigation adversaries may allege that we have not complied with certain commitments to standards-setting organizations and therefore that we are not entitled to the relief that we seek.  For example, a party may allege that we have not complied with an obligation to offer a license to a party on FRAND terms and conditions, and may also file antitrust claims, unfair competition claims or regulatory complaints on that or other bases, and may seek damages and other relief based on such claims.  Litigation adversaries have also filed against us, and other third parties may in the future file, validity challenges such as inter partes proceedings in the USPTO, which can lead to delays of our patent infringement actions as well as potential findings of invalidity.Litigation may be also required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others.Third parties could commence litigation against us seeking to invalidate our patents or obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential, are invalid or are unenforceable.  In addition, current and prospective licensees have initiated proceedings against us claiming, and others in the future may claim, that we have not complied with our FRAND licensing commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities.11Table of ContentsThe cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property and of defending our licensing practices has been and may continue to be significant.  As a result, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including in certain jurisdictions the costs and fees of opposing counsel if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.Setbacks in defending our patent licensing practices could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline and could have an adverse effect on our licensing business.Adverse decisions in litigation or regulatory actions relating to our licensing practices, including, but not limited to, findings that we have not complied with our FRAND commitments and/or engaged in anticompetitive or unfair licensing activities or that any of our license agreements are void or unenforceable, could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and revenue.  Regulatory bodies may assess fines in the event of adverse findings, and in court or arbitration proceedings, an adverse decision could lead to a judgment requiring us to pay damages (including the possibility of treble damages for antitrust claims).  In addition, to the extent that legal decisions find patent license agreements to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, that could lead to a decrease in the revenue associated with and cash flow generated by such agreements, and, depending on the damages requested, could lead to the refund of certain payments already made.  Finally, adverse legal decisions related to our licensing practices could have an adverse effect on our ability to enter into to license agreements, which, in turn, could cause our cash flow and revenue to decline.Changes in financial accounting standards or policies may affect our reported financial condition or results of operations and, in certain cases, could cause a decline and/or fluctuations in the price of our common stock.From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and the SEC change their guidance governing the form and content of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), such as the FASB and the SEC, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions with regard to how these standards should be applied. A change in accounting principles or their interpretation can have a significant effect on our reported results. In certain cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently.  Potential changes in reporting standards could substantially change our reporting practices in a number of areas, including revenue recognition and recording of assets and liabilities, and affect our reported financial condition or results of operations.For example, in May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board issued revenue guidance, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, that, once adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018, could significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition for new and existing contracts with licensees.  Under the new standard, the Company may be required to recognize up to a substantial majority of the royalties under a fixed-fee license agreement upfront upon entry into the agreement, as opposed to recognizing the royalties on a quarterly basis over the term of the agreement, which has been the historical practice of many licensing companies, including InterDigital.  For InterDigital, this could impact the revenue recognition of all of its existing fixed-fee patent license agreements, including certain fixed-fee agreements that cover both our current technologies and future technologies that are added to our portfolio during the term of the license, such as our patent license agreements with Apple and Samsung.  In addition, our current practice, which is shared by many licensing companies and discussed in further detail in Note 2, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" of reporting revenues from per-unit royalty-based agreements one quarter in arrears would no longer be accepted, and instead we will be expected to estimate royalty-based revenues each quarter in order to report such revenue in the period in which the underlying sales occurred, which will result in the recognition of an adjustment to true up revenue to the actual amounts reported by our licensees.  Such changes to our reporting practices could significantly affect our reported financial condition and results of operations, potentially causing the amount of revenue we recognize to vary dramatically from quarter to quarter, and even year to year, depending on the timing of entry into license agreements and whether such agreements have fixed-fee or per-unit royalty terms.  In addition, these changes to our reporting practices and the resulting fluctuations in our reported revenue could cause a decline and/or fluctuations in the price of our common stock.  See also Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Overview -- New Accounting Guidance.Our technologies may not be become patented, adopted by wireless standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced technology and related solutions. However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G and beyond, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities. There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future. Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and adopted by the relevant standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed. Competing technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or 12Table of Contentsdeployment of technologies we develop. If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant standards or are not adopted by and deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods we expect, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions or investments or engage in other strategic transactions that could result in significant changes, costs and/or management disruption and that may fail to enhance shareholder value or produce the anticipated benefits.We have in the past and may in the future acquire companies (such as our recent acquisition of Hillcrest Labs), businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions.  In addition, we may make investments in other entities by purchasing minority equity interests or corporate bonds/notes in publicly traded or privately held companies. Acquisitions or strategic investments may increase our costs, including but not limited to accounting and legal fees, and may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies. Most strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and may not become liquid for a period of time, if at all.  In some cases, strategic investments may serve as consideration for a license in lieu of cash royalties.  In addition, other investments may not generate financial returns or may result in losses due to market volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. We have in the past and may in the future make strategic investments in early-stage companies, which require us to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of those companies. Our share of any such losses may adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments.Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions (including our recent acquisition of Hillcrest Labs) depends in part upon our ability to integrate the acquired companies, businesses and/or assets in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, including, among others: successfully integrating new employees, technology and/or products; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.  As a result, we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In addition, we cannot be certain that the integration of acquired companies, businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits we anticipate to result from such acquisitions.  Our plans to integrate and/or expand upon research and development programs and technologies obtained through acquisitions may result in products or technologies that are not adopted by the market, or the market may adopt solutions competitive to our products or technologies.  We may not derive any commercial value from the acquired technology or intellectual property or from future technologies or products based on the acquired technology and/or intellectual property. In addition, to the extent we are separately seeking a patent license from a customer or customers of an acquired entity, the acquired entity may lose such customers.  Following the completion of the acquisition, we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification protection we may obtain and we may encounter patent validity, infringement or enforcement issues or unforeseen expenses not uncovered during our diligence process.  Any acquired company or business would be subject to its own risks that may or may not be the same as the risks already disclosed herein.Challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements. One of the most significant challenges we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions. As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them. The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense. Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time. Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot ensure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline. The length of time required to negotiate a license agreement also leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.In addition, as discussed more fully above, we are currently operating in a challenging regulatory and judicial environment, which may, under certain circumstances, lead to delays in the negotiation of and entry into new patent license agreements.   Also, as discussed below and in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K, we are also currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings with potential licensees, with whom we do not yet have a patent license agreement.  Any such delays in the negotiation or entry into new patent license agreements and receipt of the associated revenue stream could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Our revenues are derived primarily from a limited number of licensees or customers.13Table of ContentsWe earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees or customers for the foreseeable future.  For example, in 2016, Apple, Huawei, Pegatron and Samsung accounted for approximately 25%, 23%, 20% and 10% of our total revenues, respectively. In the event that we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements upon expiration, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, in the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations (for example, due to a credit issue or in connection with a legal dispute or similar proceeding) under their respective license agreements, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.  See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K for a description of our material legal proceedings.  In addition, in the event that there is a material decrease in shipments of licensed products by one of our significant per-unit licensees, our revenues from such licensee could significantly decline and our future revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected.Our plans to broaden our revenue sources through enhanced intellectual property sourcing, joint ventures, and developing or acquiring technology in new or expanded areas, such as in the IoT space, may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to broaden our revenue sources through targeted acquisitions, research partnerships, joint ventures and the continued development of new technologies.  Increasingly, our future growth in part depends on developing or acquiring technology in new or expanded areas and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries, such as the IoT, including the connected home and smart cities, automotive, mobile computing, mobile health and sensor technology, and on third parties incorporating our technology and solutions into device types used in these areas and industry segments.  There is no guarantee that we will succeed in acquiring or developing technology and patents or partnering with inventors and research organizations to create new revenue opportunities and/or add new dimensions to our existing portfolio of intellectual property and potentially create new patent licensing programs. Also, our development activities may experience delays, which could reduce our opportunities for patent licensing or other avenues of revenue generation related to such development activities. In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.Our plans to expand our revenue sources through commercializing our market-ready technologies and acquiring and/or developing new technology with commercial applicability may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to expand our revenue sources through the continued development, commercialization and licensing of technology projects.   Our technology development and acquisition activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, if at all, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing.  In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect.  Technology markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, infrastructure improvements.  Additionally, investing in technology development is costly and may require structural changes to the organization that could require additional costs, including without limitation legal and accounting fees.  Furthermore, delays or failures to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate technology development efforts and secure support for our technologies or delays or failures to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows, or decrease our ability to remain competitive.  Our investments in new commercial initiatives may not be successful or generate meaningful revenues.We have invested, and may continue to invest, in new businesses focused on commercializing technology that we have developed, incubated internally and/or acquired.  Commercial success depends on many factors, including the demand for the technology, the highly competitive markets for our technology products, regulatory issues associated with such technology products, and effective marketing and licensing or product sales.  In addition, our new technology offerings may require robust ecosystems of customers and service providers that may fail to materialize.  Further, the establishment and operation of these commercial initiatives requires significant support, including technical, legal and financial resources.  It is possible that these commercial initiatives will not be successful and/or will not achieve meaningful revenues for a number of years, if at all.  Further, we may attempt to develop technologies or services that we believe we would be able to sell or license commercially using inside or outside technical, legal and financial resources.  If our new commercial initiatives are not successful, or are not successful in the timeframe we anticipate, we may incur significant costs, our business may not grow as anticipated and/or our reputation may be harmed.  In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.Our strategy to diversify our patent-based revenue by pursuing alternative patent licensing arrangements and patent sales may not be successful.14Table of ContentsThere is no guarantee that we will succeed in our pursuit of select patent licensing arrangements or patent sales, and, if we are successful, there is no guarantee that the revenue and cash flow generated through such alternative licensing arrangements (such as the Signal Trust and the Avanci licensing platform) or patent sales will be greater than the revenue and cash flow we would have generated if we had retained and/or licensed the patents ourselves. In addition, potential licensees may be reluctant to enter into new patent license agreements, and current licensees may be reluctant to renew their agreements, either at all or on terms acceptable to the Company, based on the fact that we have sold portions of our patent portfolio or the belief that we plan to sell or transfer some of the patents we are asking them to license.    We depend on key senior management, engineering, patent and licensing resources.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized patent, licensing, engineering and other skills. The market for such talent in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and with significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface technologies. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions in any litigation, arbitration or regulatory proceeding, by our ability to offer competitive cash and equity compensation and work environment conditions and by the geographic location of our various offices. The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements and undertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as our ability to meet our strategic objectives.Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements due to downward product pricing pressures and competition over a finite pool of patent royalties.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless industry, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates and/or that such rates should be applied to royalty bases smaller than the selling price of an end product (such as the “smallest salable patent practicing unit”). There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain wireless products, including handsets, that we believe implement our patented inventions, and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of handsets. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products for the cellular market. Demands by certain licensees to reduce royalties due to pricing pressure or the number of patent holders seeking royalties on their cellular technologies, could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow.Our revenue and cash flow are dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A portion of our licensing revenues is running royalty-based and dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global, regional and/or country-specific economic conditions, country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, buying patterns of end users, competition for our licensees' products and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products. In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our products or technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect, (ii) a decline in the financial condition of any licensee or (iii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global or regional economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies or otherwise. It is also difficult to predict the timing, nature and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement and new licenses, strategic relationships and the resolution of legal proceedings. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition. In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees. As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period. Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.Our revenue may be affected by the deployment of future-generation wireless standards in place of 3G and 4G technologies, by the timing of such deployment, or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.Although we own an evolving portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G and 5G cellular technologies and non-cellular technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program for future-generation wireless standards may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our current licensing programs. Although we continue to participate in worldwide standards bodies and contribute our intellectual property to future-generation wireless standards, including standards that will 15Table of Contentsdefine 5G, our technologies might not be adopted by the relevant standards.  In addition, we may not be as successful in the licensing of future-generation products as we have been in licensing 3G and 4G products, or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such products that is comparable to that which we have historically received on 3G and 4G products.  Furthermore, if there is a delay in the standardization and/or deployment of 5G, our business and revenue could be negatively impacted.     The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designed to operate in accordance with specified cellular technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or anticipated to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement. Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us. We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We may not be able to extend or modify these license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, on financial terms acceptable to us, without affecting the other material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees or at all. Further, such extensions, modifications or new license agreements may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to any extension, modification or new license.Delays in renewing or an inability to renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Many of our license agreements have fixed terms. Although we endeavor to renew license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before the expiration of the license agreement, on acceptable terms after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all. If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, we could lose existing licensees, and our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements. Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.We face risks from doing business in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees, potential licensees and customers are international, and our licensees, potential licensees and customers sell their products to markets throughout the world. Accordingly, we could be subject to the effects of a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; biased enforcement of foreign laws and regulations to promote industrial or economic policies at our expense; currency control regulations and variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; and general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments. In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees, potential licensees and customers do business.    Concentration and consolidation in the wireless communications industry could adversely affect our business.There is some concentration among participants in the wireless communications industry, and the industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses, and these trends may continue.  For example, in 2016, Samsung, Apple and Huawei collectively accounted for approximately 40% of worldwide shipments of 3G and 4G handsets.  Any further concentration or sale within the wireless industry among handset providers and/or original design manufacturers (""ODMs"") may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations.  In addition, acquisitions of or consolidation among ODMs could 16Table of Contentscause handset providers who outsource manufacturing to make supply chain changes, which in turn could result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations (for example, if manufacturing is moved from an ODM with which we have a patent license agreement to an ODM with which we do not).  Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.Our use of open source software could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.Certain of our technology and our suppliers’ technology may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such technology may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for derivative works available or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different from what we customarily use to license our technology. While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that, if we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our technology, discontinue the sale of our technology, release the source code of our proprietary technology to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. There is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage. Our commercialization activities could lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could materially adversely affect our business.The legal doctrines of patent exhaustion and implied license may be subject to different judicial interpretations.  Our commercialization of certain technologies could potentially lead to patent exhaustion or implied license issues that could adversely affect our patent licensing program and limit our ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under such program.  In the event of successful challenges by current or prospective licensees based on these doctrines that result in a material decrease to our patent licensing revenue, our financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.Changes to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding. Pursuant to the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual. In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our per-unit licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.    The standard terms of our per-unit license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end.We may experience difficulties implementing our new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. We plan to implement a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system over the next year. The ERP system is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to 17Table of Contentsour management team.  Implementation of the new system is highly dependent on coordination of multiple software and system providers and internal business teams. We may experience difficulties as we transition to the new ERP system and processes, including loss or corruption of data, decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and increased costs. In addition, transitioning to the new ERP system requires significant investment of financial and human resources. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management and plan to maintain our existing ERP system for a period of time, significant implementation issues may arise with respect to the new ERP system.  Difficulties in implementing the new system or significant system failures could disrupt our operations or lead to a delay or error in financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition or results of operations.The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks. The growth of our business could be adversely affected if this occurs.Market projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions. In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate. The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our products and solutions that we may market or set forth into the standards-setting arena. Due to competing products and solutions, our products and solutions may not find a viable commercial marketplace or, where applicable, be adopted by the relevant standards. In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold essential patents, for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain product or products. In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property. To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.Our technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies. Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the marketplace or in the standards setting arena. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful. Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected. In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants. Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.Our business may be adversely affected if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights with respect to products and/or solutions that we sell or license.   18Table of ContentsThird parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights with respect to products and/or solutions we sell or license.  Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. Furthermore, third parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could block our ability to further develop or commercialize some of our technologies or services in the United States and abroad and could cause us to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our products.  Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards. Even if we have an agreement that provides for a third party to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to perform its contractual obligations.  If we cannot use valid IP that we infringe at all or on reasonable terms, or substitute similar non-infringing technology from another source, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.We may be subject to warranty and/or product liability claims with respect to our products, which could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could expose us to loss and reputational damage.We may be subject to claims if customers of our product offerings are injured or experience failures or other quality issues.  We may from time to time be subject to warranty and product liability claims with regard to product performance and our services. We could incur losses as a result of warranty, support, repair or replacement costs in response to customer complaints or in connection with the resolution of contemplated or actual legal proceedings relating to such claims. In addition to potential losses arising from claims and related legal proceedings, warranty and product liability claims could affect our reputation and our relationship with customers.  Our engineering services business could subject us to specific costs and risks that we might fail to manage adequately.We derive a portion of our revenues from engineering services. Any mismanagement of, or negative development in, a number of areas, including, among others, the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under our service contracts, could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline, damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract future licensees, which would in turn harm our operating results. If we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts, we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract. We need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues. Our failure to monitor these services adequately may harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our activities and international strategic investments.We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which may change over time as our business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. We operate and invest globally. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings. Our exposure to foreign currencies may increase as we expand into new markets.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies. If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows. In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.•If as a result of tax treaty procedures, the U.S. government reaches an agreement with certain foreign governments to whom we have paid foreign taxes, resulting in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits, such agreement could result in foreign currency gain or loss.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated.  These attempts, which in some cases could be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of 19Table of Contentsour intellectual property and/or confidential business or personal information (whether through a breach of our own systems or the breach of a system of a third party that provides services to us) could harm our competitive or negotiating positions, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, compromise our patent enforcement strategies or outlook, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.  In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees’, licensees’, or customers’ confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. We could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.If wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks, demand for products of our licensees could decrease.Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate medical equipment. Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the products of our licensees. In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for the products of our licensees.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the 2020 NotesThe price of our common stock is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our common stock, and such fluctuations could continue. From January 2, 2014 to February 21, 2017, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $26.25 per share to a high of $102.30 per share. The market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:•the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC and announcements relating to licensing, technology development, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and intellectual property impacting us or our business;•announcements concerning strategic transactions, such as commercial initiatives, joint ventures, strategic investments, acquisitions or divestitures;•financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;•changes in GAAP, including new accounting standards that may materially affect our revenue recognition;•changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;•investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-term goals;•changes in market share of significant licensees;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other wireless communications companies generally; and•market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole.In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $316.0 million.  This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our 1.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the ""2020 Notes"");•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.20Table of ContentsAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes.Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the 2020 Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the 2020 Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the 2020 Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other currently existing or future outstanding indebtedness.Our shareholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.Our current dividend policy, contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on our outstanding common stock. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, the dividend policy and the payment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.If securities or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the 2020 Notes may affect the value of the 2020 Notes and the market price of our common stock.In connection with each offering of the 2020 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”) and sold warrants to the option counterparties. These transactions will be accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the 2020 Notes. The warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.In connection with establishing their initial hedge of these transactions, the option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) purchased our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions and/or entered various cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the 2020 Notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing (or reducing the size of any decrease in) the price of our common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the 2020 Notes. In addition, the option counterparties (and/or their affiliates) may modify their respective hedge positions from time to time (including during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2020 Notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions.The potential effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Future sales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our common stock.21Table of ContentsSales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. We also have several institutional shareholders that own significant blocks of our common stock. If one or more of these shareholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.Under certain circumstances, shares of our common stock could be issued upon conversion of the 2020 Notes, which would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders. In addition, the issuance of additional common stock, or issuances of securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock or other equity linked securities, including preferred stock or warrants, would dilute the ownership interest of our common shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.Approved stock repurchase programs may not result in a positive return of capital to shareholders.Our board-approved stock repurchase program may not return value to shareholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver shareholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.Provisions of the 2020 Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the 2020 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the 2020 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their 2020 Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such 2020 Notes in integral multiples of $1,000. We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that the option counterparties may default under the respective convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.The accounting method for convertible debt securities, such as the 2020 Notes, could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.In May 2008, the FASB, issued ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments, such as the 2020 Notes, that may be settled partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost.  ASC 470-20 requires the fair value of the conversion option of the 2020 Notes be reported as a component of shareholders’ equity and included in the additional paid-in-capital on our consolidated balance sheet.  The value of the conversion option of the 2020 Notes will be reported as discount to the 2020 Notes.  We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period’s amortization of the debt discount (non-cash interest) and the instrument’s cash interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2020 Notes"
8,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2014-02-24,"     RISK FACTORS.We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.Risks Related to Our BusinessRulings in legal proceedings and the outcome of potential patent legislation, USPTO rule changes and international patent rule changes may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and could have a material adverse effect on our licensing business as well as our business as a whole.Rulings in our legal proceedings as well as those of third parties may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement.  For example, the U.S. International Trade Commission has recently taken some actions that have been viewed as unfavorable to patentees, including the company, seeking recourse in this forum.  Any potential changes in the law or other developments that reduce the number of forums available or the type of relief available in such forums (such as injunctive relief), or that otherwise cause us to seek alternative forums (such as arbitration or state court), would make it more difficult for InterDigital to enforce its patents, whether in adversarial proceedings or in negotiations.  Because we have historically depended on the availability of certain forms of legal process to enforce our patents and obtain fair and adequate compensation for the use of our intellectual property by unauthorized parties, developments that undermine our ability to do so could have a negative impact on the company’s revenue and future licensing efforts.  In addition, changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure and remedies that we may be entitled to in patent litigation and may require us to reevaluate and modify our patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies.  We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.Challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements. The most significant challenge we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions. As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them. The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense. Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time. Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot assure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline. In addition, the length of time required to negotiate a license agreement leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless industry, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates. There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain products, including handsets, that we believe implement our patented inventions, and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of handsets. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products for the cellular market. The increasing pricing pressure, as well as the number of patent holders seeking royalties on their cellular technologies, could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow. Finally, to the extent that royalty rates are determined through arbitration or other legal proceedings, because litigation and adversarial proceedings are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and there are few precedents for such determinations, it is possible that such rates may be lower than our historical rates, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow.Increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business and/or lead to monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions.12Table of ContentsDomestic and foreign regulatory authorities have recently increased their scrutiny of the use of standards-essential patents in the mobile wireless industry, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors. Such scrutiny has resulted in, and may lead to additional, inquiries that may lead to enforcement actions against the company and/or impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation. Such inquiries and/or enforcement actions could result in monetary fines, penalties or other remedies or sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Major telecommunications equipment manufacturers have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot assure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity, enforceability or scope of certain of our patents and/or any successful design-around of certain patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.Our revenues are derived primarily from a limited number of licensees or customers.We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees or customers for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2013, Pegatron, Intel and Sony accounted for approximately 30%, 18% and 12% of our total revenues, respectively. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations under their respective license agreements, we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements upon expiration or our revenues from these licensees significantly decline, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.Our plans to broaden our revenue sources through enhanced technology sourcing, commercializing our market-ready technologies and research capabilities and developing new technology with commercial applicability may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our business strategy, we are seeking to broaden our revenue sources through joint ventures, services agreements and the continued development, commercialization and licensing of technology projects. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in acquiring or developing technology and patents or partnering with inventors and research organizations to contribute new areas to our existing portfolio of intellectual property.   Also, our technology development activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing.  Additionally, investing in technology development is costly and may require structural changes to the organization that could require additional costs, including without limitation legal and accounting fees.  Furthermore, delays or failures to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failures to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality, could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows, or decrease our ability to remain competitive.  In addition, the commercialization of certain technologies could potentially lead to patent exhaustion issues that could limit the company’s ability to derive licensing revenue from certain patents under its patent licensing program.  In the event that any of these risks materialize, our long-term business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. Our strategy to diversify our patent-based revenue by pursuing patent licensing arrangements and patent sales may not be successful.There is no guarantee that we will succeed in our pursuit of select patent licensing arrangements or patent sales, and, if we are successful, there is no guarantee that the revenue and cash flow generated through such patent sales or licensing arrangements (including trust arrangements) will be greater than the revenue and cash flow we would have generated if we had retained and licensed the patents ourselves. In addition, potential licensees may be reluctant to enter into new patent license agreements, and current licensees may be reluctant to renew their agreements, either at all or on terms acceptable to the company, based on the belief that we plan to sell or transfer some of the patents we are asking them to license. Due to the nature of our business, we could be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights.13Table of ContentsWhile some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import or use products, we may commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we could face counterclaims that challenge the essential nature of our patents, that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed or that our royalty rates are other than fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. As a result of enforcing our patents, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including the costs and fees of opposing counsel in certain jurisdictions if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.In addition, the cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property has been and may continue to be significant. Litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others. In addition, third parties could commence litigation against us seeking to invalidate our patents or obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential, are invalid or are unenforceable. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and could require significant amounts of time by key members of executive management and other personnel. Our revenue and cash flow are dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A significant portion of our licensing revenues are running royalty-based and dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global and/or country-specific economic conditions, country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, buying patterns of end users, competition for our licensees' products and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products. In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our products or technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect or a decline in the financial condition of any licensee or (ii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies or otherwise. It is also difficult to predict the timing and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement and new licenses and the timing, nature or amount of revenues associated with strategic relationships. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition. In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees. As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period. Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.We may engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions or make investments that could result in significant changes, costs and/or management disruption and fail to enhance shareholder value.We may acquire or develop businesses, acquire technology and/or intellectual property, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, purchase equity and debt securities in other entities, including minority equity interests and corporate bonds/notes in publicly traded and privately held companies or create new businesses. In some cases, such strategic investments may serve as consideration for a license in lieu of cash royalties. Most strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. Further, we may attempt to develop technologies or services that we believe we would be able to sell or license commercially using inside or outside technical, legal and financial resources.  Acquisitions or strategic investments may increase our costs, including but not limited to accounting and legal fees, and may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies. In addition, other investments may not generate financial returns or may result in losses due to market volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. We could make strategic investments in early-stage companies, which require us to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of those companies. Our share of any such losses may adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments.  Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. We cannot assure you that the integration of acquired businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits 14Table of Contentswe anticipate to result from such acquisitions. In addition, any acquired companies or business or newly developed technology or service we may offer would be subject to its own risks that may or may not be the same as the risks already disclosed herein.  We may not derive any commercial value from the acquired or developed technology, products and intellectual property or from future technologies and products based on the acquired or developed technology and/or intellectual property, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification protection we may obtain.Our revenue may be affected by the deployment of 4G or other technologies in place of 2G and 3G technologies or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.Although we own a growing portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 4G and non-cellular technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program in these areas is less established and may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our 2G and 3G licensing programs. Many wireless operators have selected LTE as their next-generation technology for deployment in existing or future spectrum bands as complementary to their existing 2G or 3G networks. Although we believe that certain of our technology is, may be or may become essential to the LTE standard, we may not be as successful in licensing 4G products or products containing other technologies as we have been in licensing 2G and 3G products or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such products that is comparable to that we have historically received on 2G and 3G products.The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designated to operate in accordance with specified cellular technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or soon to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement. As a result, many of our current patent license agreements cover products designed to operate in accordance with 2G and/or 3G standards but do not cover products designed to operate in accordance with 4G standards. Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us. We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We may not be able to modify these license agreements on financial terms acceptable to us, without affecting the other material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees or at all. Further, such modifications may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to modification.Consolidation in the wireless communications industry could adversely affect our business.The wireless communications industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses, and these trends may continue. Any concentration or sale within the wireless industry may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations. For example, in 2013, Samsung, Nokia and Apple collectively accounted for just over 50% of worldwide handset shipments.  Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.We depend on key senior management, engineering, patent and licensing resources.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our directors, executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized patent, licensing, engineering and other skills. The market for such talent in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and with significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface technologies. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions in any litigation or arbitration, by our ability to offer competitive cash and equity compensation and work environment conditions and by the geographic location of our various offices. The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements and undertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as our ability to meet our strategic objectives.We face risks from doing business in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees are international, and our licensees sell their products to markets throughout the world. Accordingly, we could be subject to the effects of a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; currency control regulations and variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; and 15Table of Contentsgeneral delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments. In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees do business.Changes to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding. With our January 1, 2007 adoption of the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual. In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Our technologies may not be become patented, adopted by wireless standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced wireless technology and related solutions. However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G and beyond, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities. There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future. Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and adopted by the relevant standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed. Competing digital wireless technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop. If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant standards or deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods we expect, or if we are unable to secure partner support for our technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.The standard terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end.Delays in renewing or an inability to renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Many of our license agreements have fixed terms. We endeavor to renew license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements and, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before the expiration of the license agreement, on acceptable terms after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all. If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, we could lose existing licensees, and our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements. Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond 16Table of Contentsadequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks. The growth of our business could be adversely affected if this occurs.Market projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions. In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate. The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.The markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize in the manner we expect.We are positioning our current development projects for the evolving advanced digital wireless markets. Certain of these markets may continue to develop at a slower rate or pace than we expect and may be of a smaller size than we expect. In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect. The development of advanced wireless markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of advanced wireless infrastructure and mobile devices, rate of growth in telecommunications services and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, radio frequency licenses and infrastructure improvements. Failure of the markets for our technologies and/or our products to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect could reduce our opportunities for sales and licensing and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies, including the in-house development teams at wireless device and semiconductor manufacturing companies and operators, developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our solutions that we may market or set forth into the standards-setting arena. Due to competing solutions, our solutions may not find a viable commercial marketplace or be adopted by the relevant standards. In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold essential patents, for a share of the available royalties. In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property. To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.Our technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies. Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the marketplace or in the standards setting arena. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful. Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected. In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.17Table of ContentsSuccessful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants. Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.Our engineering services business could subject us to specific costs and risks that we might fail to manage adequately.We derive a portion of our revenues from engineering services. Any mismanagement of, or negative development in, a number of areas, including, among others, the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under our service contracts, could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline, damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract future licensees, which would in turn harm our operating results. If we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts, we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract. We need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues. Our failure to monitor these services adequately may harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Changes in financial accounting standards or policies may affect our reported financial condition or results of operations.From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and the SEC change their guidance governing the form and content of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), such as the FASB and the SEC may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions with regard to how these standards should be applied. A change in accounting principles or their interpretation can have a significant effect on our reported results. In certain cases, the company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently. For example, in January 2012, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board released an updated exposure draft, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which, if it becomes final, could significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition for new and existing contracts with licensees. This and other potential changes in reporting standards could substantially change our reporting practices in a number of areas, including revenue recognition and recording of assets and liabilities, and affect our reported financial condition or results of operations.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our activities and international strategic investments.We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which may change over time as our business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. We operate and invest globally. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings. Our exposure to foreign currencies may increase as we expand into new markets.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies. If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows. In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.If wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks, demand for products of our licensees could decrease.Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate medical equipment. Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the products of our licensees. In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for the products of our licensees.18Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the NotesThe price of our common stock is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our common stock, and such fluctuations could continue. From January 3, 2011 to February 21, 2014, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $22.37 per share to a high of $82.50 per share. The market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:•the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC and announcements relating to licensing, technology development, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and intellectual property impacting us or our business;•announcements concerning strategic transactions, such as spin-offs, joint ventures and acquisitions or divestitures;•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;•changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;•investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-term goals;•changes in market share of significant licensees;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other wireless communications companies generally; and•market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole.In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.Our increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total consolidated long-term debt as of December 31, 2013 was approximately $208.8 million. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our 2.50% senior convertible notes due 2016 (the “Notes”);•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Notes.Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the Notes and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other future outstanding indebtedness.Our stockholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.Our initial dividend policy, adopted and announced in December 2010, contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on our outstanding common stock. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, the dividend policy and the 19Table of Contentspayment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.If securities or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes may affect our earnings per share and/or the market price for our common stock.In connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with an affiliate of the initial purchaser (the “option counterparty”). We also sold warrants to the option counterparty. These transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders' equity. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the Notes. The warrants will have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per common share of our common stock, as measured under the warrants, exceeds the strike price of the warrants at the time the warrants are exercisable.In connection with establishing its initial hedge of these transactions, the option counterparty (and/or an affiliate thereof) purchased our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions and/or entered various cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes. The option counterparty (and/or an affiliate thereof) may modify its hedge positions from time to time (including during any conversion period related to a conversion of the Notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Future sales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our common stock.Sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. We also have several institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our common stock. If one or more of these stockholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.Under certain circumstances, shares of our common stock could be issued upon conversion of the Notes, which would dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. In addition, the issuance of additional common stock, or issuances of securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock or other equity linked securities, including preferred stock or warrants, would dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders and could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.Approved stock repurchase programs may not result in a positive return of capital to stockholders.Our board-approved stock repurchase program may not return value to stockholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver stockholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.Provisions of the Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, including the sale of all or substantially all of our 20Table of Contentsassets, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such Notes. We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing an acquisition of us by a third party.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that the option counterparty may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate their obligations, under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparty will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparty"
14,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2013-02-26,"     RISK FACTORS.We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.Risks Related to Our BusinessRulings in third party legal proceedings, increased scrutiny by antitrust authorities, the outcome of potential patent legislation, USPTO rule changes and international patent rule changes may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business.The potential effect of rulings in legal proceedings among third parties may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement. In addition, domestic and foreign antitrust authorities have recently increased their scrutiny of the use of standard essential patents in the mobile wireless industry, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors. Such scrutiny may lead to an increase in antitrust inquiries and/or enforcement actions and/or impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation. Finally, changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure and remedies we may be entitled to in patent litigation and may require us to reevaluate and modify our patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies. We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.Setbacks in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Major telecommunications equipment manufacturers have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot assure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity, enforceability or scope of certain of our patents and/or any successful design-around of certain patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms.12Table of ContentsOur recently announced plans to broaden our revenue sources through enhanced technology sourcing, commercializing our market-ready technologies and research capabilities and pursuing patent licensing partnerships and patent sales may not be successful and could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.On January 23, 2012, we announced that we had expanded our business plan to include patent sales and patent licensing partnerships as additional vehicles to generate revenue. On October 23, 2012, we announced a further expansion of our business strategy by enhancing our technology sourcing and establishing a business unit dedicated to monetizing the company's market-ready technologies and research capabilities. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in acquiring technology and patents or partnering with inventors and research organizations to contribute new areas to our existing portfolio of intellectual property. Also, our technology development activities may experience delays, or the markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect, each of which could reduce our opportunities for technology sales and licensing and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in our pursuit of select patent licensing partnerships or additional patent sales, and, if we are successful, there is no guarantee that the revenue and cash flow generated through such patent sales or licensing partnerships will be greater than the revenue and cash flow we would have generated if we had retained and licensed the patents ourselves. In addition, potential licensees may be reluctant to enter into new patent license agreements, and current licensees may be reluctant to renew their agreements, either at all or on terms acceptable to the company, based on the belief that we plan to sell some of the patents we are asking them to license, which could ultimately cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements. The most significant challenge we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions. As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them. The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense. Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time. Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot assure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline. In addition, the length of time required to negotiate a license agreement leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Due to the nature of our business, we could be involved in a number of costly litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights.While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import, or use products, we may commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we could face counterclaims that challenge the essential nature of our patents, that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed or that our royalty rates are other than fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. As a result of enforcing our patents, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including the costs and fees of opposing counsel in certain jurisdictions if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities.In addition, the cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property has been and may continue to be significant. Litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others. In addition, third parties could commence litigation against us seeking to invalidate our patents or obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential, are invalid or are unenforceable. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and could require significant amounts of time by key members of executive management and other personnel.13Table of ContentsOur revenue may be affected by the deployment of 4G or other technologies in place of 2G and 3G technologies or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents.Although we own a growing portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 4G and non-cellular technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program in these areas is less established and may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our 2G and 3G licensing programs. Many wireless operators have selected LTE (or, to a lesser extent, WiMAX) as next-generation technologies for deployment in existing or future spectrum bands as complementary to their existing 2G or 3G networks. Although we believe that certain of our technology is, may be or may become essential to LTE and WiMAX standards, we may not be as successful in licensing 4G products as we have been in licensing 2G and 3G products or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such 4G products that is comparable to that we have historically received on 2G and 3G products.The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designated to operate in accordance with specified cellular technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or soon to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement. As a result, most of our current patent license agreements cover products designed to operate in accordance with 2G and/or 3G Standards but do not cover products designed to operate in accordance with 4G Standards. Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us. We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We may not be able to modify these license agreements on financial terms acceptable to us, without affecting the other material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees or at all. Further, such modifications may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to modification.Our revenue and cash flow are dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast.A significant portion of our licensing revenues are running royalty-based and dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global and/or country-specific economic conditions, country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, buying patterns of end users, competition for our licensees' products and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products. In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our products or technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect or a decline in the financial condition of any licensee or (ii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies or otherwise. It is also difficult to predict the timing and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement and new licenses and the timing, nature or amount of revenues associated with strategic relationships. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition. In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees. As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period. Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future.Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements.Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless industry, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates. There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain products, including handsets, that we believe implement our patented inventions and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of handsets. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products for the cellular market. The increasing pricing pressure, as well as the number of patent holders seeking royalties on their cellular technologies, could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow.Our revenues are derived primarily from a limited number of licensees or customers.The mobile device market is very concentrated. As a result, we earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees or customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2012, Intel and Samsung comprised approximately 57% and 15% of our total revenues, respectively. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees or customers fail to meet 14Table of Contentstheir payment or reporting obligations under their respective license agreements, we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements upon expiration or our revenues from these licensees significantly decline, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.We depend on key senior management, engineering, patent and licensing resources.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our directors, executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized patent, licensing, engineering and other skills. The market for such talent in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and with significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface technologies. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions in any litigation or arbitration, by our ability to offer competitive cash and equity compensation and work environment conditions and by the geographic location of our various offices. The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements and undertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as our ability to meet our strategic objectives.Delays in renewing or an inability to renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Many of our license agreements have fixed terms. We endeavor to renew license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements and, due to various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before the expiration of the license agreement, on acceptable terms after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all. If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, we could lose existing licensees, and our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. For example, the 3G portion of our patent license agreement with Samsung expired at the end of 2012. If we are unable to renew this agreement at all or on acceptable terms, our revenue would be adversely affected.Changes to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding. With our January 1, 2007 adoption of the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual. In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Our technologies may not be become patented, adopted by wireless standards or widely deployed.We invest significant resources in the development of advanced wireless technology and related solutions. However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G products, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities. There is no assurance that these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future. Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and adopted by the relevant Standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed. Competing digital wireless technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop. If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant Standards or deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods we expect, or if we are unable to secure partner support for our technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.15Table of ContentsIt can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.The standard terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end.Consolidation in the wireless communications industry could adversely affect our business.The wireless communications industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses, and these trends may continue. Any concentration or sale within the wireless industry may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations. Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition.We face risks from doing business in international markets.A significant portion of our licensees are international, and our licensees sell their products to markets throughout the world. Accordingly, we could be subject to the effects of a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; currency control regulations and variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; and general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments. In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees do business.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements. Changes in industry standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business.Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks. The growth of our business could be adversely affected if this occurs.Market projections and data are forward-looking in nature.Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions. In addition, market data upon which we 16Table of Contentsrely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate. The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.The markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize in the manner we expect.We are positioning our current development projects for the evolving advanced digital wireless markets. Certain of these markets may continue to develop at a slower rate or pace than we expect and may be of a smaller size than we expect. In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect. The development of advanced wireless markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of advanced wireless infrastructure and mobile devices, rate of growth in telecommunications services and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, radio frequency licenses and infrastructure improvements. Failure of the markets for our technologies and/or our products to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect could reduce our opportunities for sales and licensing and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies.We face competition from companies, including the in-house development teams at wireless device and semiconductor manufacturing companies and operators, developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our solutions that we may set forth into the standards-setting arena. Due to competing solutions, our solutions may not be adopted by the relevant standards. In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold essential patents, for a share of the available royalties. In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property. To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.Our technology development activities may experience delays.We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies. Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the Standards setting arena. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful. Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected. In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished.We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions.Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants. Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.We may engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions or make investments that could result in significant changes or management disruption and fail to enhance shareholder value.We continue to evaluate and may acquire businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions and purchase equity and debt securities in other entities, including minority equity interests and corporate bonds/notes in publicly traded and privately held companies. In some cases, such strategic investments may serve as consideration for a license in lieu of cash royalties. Most strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. Acquisitions or strategic investments may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies. In addition, other investments may not generate financial returns or may result in losses due to market volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. We could make strategic investments in early-stage companies, which require us to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of those companies. Our share of any such losses may adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments.Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. We cannot assure you that the integration of 17Table of Contentsacquired businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits we anticipate to result from such acquisitions. We may not derive any commercial value from the acquired technology, products and intellectual property or from future technologies and products based on the acquired technology and/or intellectual property, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification protection we may obtain.Changes in financial accounting standards or policies may affect our reported financial condition or results of operations.From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and the SEC change their guidance governing the form and content of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), such as the FASB and the SEC may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions with regard to how these standards should be applied. A change in accounting principles or their interpretation can have a significant effect on our reported results. In certain cases, the company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently. For example, in November 2011, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board released an updated exposure draft, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which, if it becomes final, could significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition for new and existing contracts with licensees. This and other potential changes in reporting standards could substantially change our reporting practices in a number of areas, including revenue recognition and recording of assets and liabilities, and affect our reported financial condition or results of operations.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our activities and international strategic investments.We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which may change over time as our business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. We operate and invest globally. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:•If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.•Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings. Our exposure to foreign currencies may increase as we expand into new markets.•Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies. If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows. In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows.Our engineering services business could subject us to specific costs and risks that we might fail to manage adequately.We derive a portion of our revenues from engineering services. Any mismanagement of, or negative development in, a number of areas, including, among others, the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under our service contracts, could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline, damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract future licensees, which would in turn harm our operating results. If we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts, we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract. We need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues. Our failure to monitor these services adequately may harm our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.If wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks, demand for products of our licensees could decrease.Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate medical equipment. Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the products of our licensees. In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for the products of our licensees.18Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the NotesThe price of our common stock is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our common stock, and such fluctuations could continue. From January 4, 2010 to February 22, 2013, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $22.30 per share to a high of $82.50 per share. The market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:•the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC and announcements relating to licensing, technology development, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and intellectual property impacting us or our business;•announcements concerning strategic transactions, such as spin-offs, joint ventures and acquisitions or divestitures;•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;•changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;•investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-term goals;•changes in market share of significant licensees;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other wireless communications companies generally; and•market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole.In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.Our increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.Our total consolidated long-term debt as of December 31, 2012 was approximately $200.4 million. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our 2.50% senior convertible notes due 2016 (the “Notes”);•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Notes.Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the Notes and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other future outstanding indebtedness.19Table of ContentsOur stockholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.Our initial dividend policy, adopted and announced in December 2010, contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on our outstanding common stock. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, the dividend policy and the payment and timing of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock price to decline.If securities or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes may affect our earnings per share and/or the market price for our common stock.In connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with an affiliate of the initial purchaser (the “option counterparty”). We also sold warrants to the option counterparty. These transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders' equity. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the Notes. The warrants will have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per common share of our common stock, as measured under the warrants, exceeds the strike price of the warrants at the time the warrants are exercisable.In connection with establishing its initial hedge of these transactions, the option counterparty (and/or an affiliate thereof) purchased our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions and/or entered various cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes. The option counterparty (and/or an affiliate thereof) may modify its hedge positions from time to time (including during any conversion period related to a conversion of the Notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Future sales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our common stock.Sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. We also have several institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our common stock. If one or more of these stockholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.Under certain circumstances, shares of our common stock could be issued upon conversion of the Notes, which would dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. In addition, the issuance of additional common stock, or issuances of securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock or other equity linked securities, including preferred stock or warrants, would dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders and could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.Approved stock repurchase programs may not result in a positive return of capital to stockholders.Our board-approved stock repurchase program may not return value to stockholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Stock repurchase programs are 20Table of Contentsintended to deliver stockholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.Provisions of the Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.Certain provisions of the Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, including the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such Notes. We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental change transactions. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing an acquisition of us by a third party.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that the option counterparty may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate their obligations, under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparty will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparty"
0,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2012-02-27,"    RISK FACTORS. We face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, the trading price of our common stock, or any combination thereof.  You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock.  If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected.  In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. Risks Related to Our Business Our recently announced plans to pursue licensing partnerships and patent sales may not be successful and could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.On January 23, 2012, in connection with our announcement that our Board of Directors had completed its review of strategic alternatives for the Company, we announced that we had expanded our business plan to include patent sales and licensing partnerships.  There is no guarantee that we will succeed in our pursuit of select patent sales and licensing partnerships, and, if we are successful, there is no guarantee that we will generate increased revenue or cash flow as a result.  For example, we may not be successful in identifying groups of patents that third parties are interested in buying or entering licensing partnerships in relation to, or, if we are, there can be no assurance that any agreement for such a sale or partnership transaction will be entered into or consummated.  Moreover, even if we do consummate a patent sale or enter into a licensing partnership, there can be no assurance that the revenue and cash flow generated through the sale of such patents or the related licensing partnership will be greater than the revenue and cash flow we would have generated if we had retained and licensed the patents ourselves. In addition, as a result of our announcement that we intend to pursue patent sales, potential licensees may be reluctant to enter into new patent license agreements, and current licensees may be reluctant to renew their agreements, either at all or on terms acceptable to the company, based on the belief that we plan to sell the patents we are asking them to license, which could ultimately cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline. We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements. The most significant challenge we face is that most potential licensees do not voluntarily seek to enter into license agreements with us before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions.  As a result, we must approach companies that are reluctant to take licenses and attempt to establish license agreements with them.  The process of identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with reluctant prospective licensees requires significant time, effort and expense.  Once discussions with unlicensed companies have commenced, we face the additional challenges imposed by the significant negotiation issues that arise from time to time. Given these challenges relating to our ability to enter into new license agreements, we cannot assure that all prospective licensees will be identified or, if they are identified, will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a 22Table of Contentspatent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could materially decline. In addition, the length of time required to negotiate a license agreement leads to delays in the receipt of the associated revenue stream, which could also cause our revenue and cash flow to decline.Our revenue may be impacted by the deployment of 4G or other technologies in place of 2G and 3G technologies or by the need to extend or modify certain existing license agreements to cover subsequently issued patents. Although we own a growing portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 4G and non-cellular technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program in these areas is less established and may not be as successful in generating licensing income as our 2G and 3G licensing programs. Many wireless operators have selected LTE (or, to a lesser extent, WiMAX) as next-generation technologies for deployment in existing or future spectrum bands as complementary to their existing 2G or 3G networks. Although we believe that certain of our technology is, may be or may become essential to LTE and WiMAX Standards, we may not be as successful in licensing 4G products as we have been in licensing 2G and 3G products or we may not achieve a level of royalty revenues on such 4G products that is comparable to that we have historically received on 2G and 3G products. The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements typically only cover products designated to operate in accordance with specified cellular technologies and that were manufactured or deployed or soon to be manufactured or deployed at the time of entry into the agreement. As a result, most of our current patent license agreements cover products designed to operate in accordance with 2G and/or 3G Standards but do not cover products designed to operate in accordance with 4G Standards. Also, we have patent license agreements with licensees that now offer for sale types of products that were not sold by such licensees at the time the patent license agreements were entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us. We do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products by our licensees that are not covered by a patent license agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We may not be able to modify these license agreements on financial terms acceptable to us, without affecting the other material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, or at all. Further, such modifications may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of products covered by the license prior to modification. Our revenue and cash flow are dependent upon our licensees' sales and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control or are difficult to forecast. A significant portion of our licensing revenues are running royalty-based and currently dependent on sales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including global and/or country-specific economic conditions, country-specific natural disasters impacting licensee manufacturing and sales, buying patterns of end users, competition for our licensees' products and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products. In addition, our operating results also could be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the licensees of our products or technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe we expect or a decline in the financial condition of any licensee or (ii) the failure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global economic conditions, political instability, natural disasters, competitive technologies or otherwise. It is also difficult to predict the timing and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement and new licenses and the timing, nature or amount of revenues associated with strategic relationships. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition. In addition, some of our patent license agreements provide for fixed payments or prepayments that cover our licensees' future sales for a specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those licensees. As a result, our cash flow has historically fluctuated from period to period. Depending upon the payment structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future. Royalty rates could decrease for future license agreements. Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be lower than anticipated. Certain licensees and others in the wireless industry, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty rates. There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on certain products, including handsets, that we believe implement our patented inventions and some of our royalty rates are tied to the pricing of handsets. In addition, a number of other companies also claim to hold patents that are essential with respect to products for the cellular market. The increasing pricing pressure, as well as the number of patent holders seeking royalties on their cellular technologies, could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future revenue and cash flow. 23Table of ContentsOur revenues are derived primarily from a limited number of licensees. The mobile device market is very concentrated. As a result, we earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licensees for the foreseeable future.  For example, in 2011, Samsung, RIM and HTC comprised approximately 34%, 14% and 11% of our total revenues, respectively. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations under their respective license agreements, we are unable to renew one or more of such license agreements upon expiration or our revenues from these licensees significantly decline, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. We depend on key senior management, engineering, patent, and licensing resources. Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our directors, executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized patent, licensing, engineering and other skills. The market for such talent in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and with significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface technologies. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions in any litigation or arbitration, by our ability to offer competitive cash and equity compensation and work environment conditions and by the geographical location of our various offices. The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements and undertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as our ability to meet our strategic objectives. Delays in renewing or an inability to renew existing license agreements could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline. Many of our license agreements have fixed terms. We endeavor to renew license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements and, based on various factors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees and, at times, reluctance on the part of our licensees to participate in renewal discussions, we may not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before the expiration of the license agreement, on acceptable terms after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all. If there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that licensee or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such licensee, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, we could lose existing licensees, and our revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. For example, the 3G portion of our patent license agreement with LG expired at the end of 2010 and negotiations have not yet yielded a new agreement.  The absence of a patent license agreement with LG in 2011 adversely affected our 2011 revenue.  The 3G portion of our patent license agreement with Samsung and our 2G/3G patent license agreement with RIM each expire at the end of 2012.  If we are unable to renew either or both of these agreements at all or on acceptable terms, our revenue would be adversely affected. Changes to our tax assets or liabilities could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding. With our January 1, 2007 adoption of the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual. In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Our technologies may not be become patented, adopted by the Standards or widely deployed. We invest significant resources in the development of advanced wireless technology and related solutions. However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be employed in current and future products, including 4G products, are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities. There is no assurance 24Table of Contentsthat these applications will issue as patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by products in the market currently or in the future.  Our investments may not be recoverable or may not result in meaningful revenue if a sufficient number of our technologies are not patented and adopted by the relevant Standards or if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed. Competing digital wireless technologies could reduce the opportunities for the adoption or deployment of technologies we develop. If the technologies in which we invest do not become patented or are not adopted by the relevant Standards or deployed in the mainstream markets, at all or at the rate or within time periods we expect, or if we are unable to secure partner support for our technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We may engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions or make investments that could result in significant changes or management disruption and fail to enhance shareholder value. We continue to evaluate and may acquire businesses, technology and/or intellectual property, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions and purchase equity and debt securities in other entities, including minority equity interests and corporate bonds/notes in publicly-traded and privately-held companies. In some cases, such strategic investments may serve as consideration for a license in lieu of cash royalties. Most strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. Acquisitions or strategic investments may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies. In addition, other investments may not generate financial returns or may result in losses due to market volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. We could make strategic investments in early-stage companies, which require us to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of those companies. Our share of any such losses may adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments. Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of acquired companies or businesses may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. We cannot assure you that the integration of acquired businesses, technology and/or intellectual property with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits we anticipate to result from such acquisitions. We may not derive any commercial value from the acquired technology, products and intellectual property or from future technologies and products based on the acquired technology and/or intellectual property, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification protection we may obtain. It can be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue. The standard terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed products and report this data to us on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we audit certain of our licensees to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give assurances that these audits will be numerous enough and/or effective to that end. Due to the nature of our business, we could be involved in a number of litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights. While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant time and effort identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import, or use products, we may commence legal or administrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement with us. In turn, we could face counterclaims that challenge the essential nature of our patents, that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed or that our royalty rates are other than fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. As a result of enforcing our patents, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including the costs and fees of opposing counsel in certain jurisdictions if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert these employees from other business activities. In addition, the cost of enforcing and defending our intellectual property has been and may continue to be significant. Litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others. In addition, third 25Table of Contentsparties could commence litigation against us seeking to invalidate our patents or obtain a determination that our patents are not infringed, are not essential, are invalid or are unenforceable. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and could require significant amounts of time by key members of executive management and other personnel. Challenges in defending and enforcing our patent rights could cause our revenue and cash flow to decline. Major telecommunications equipment manufacturers have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot assure that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product or Standard. Moreover, third parties could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity, enforceability or scope of certain of our patents and/or any successful design-around of certain patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees, through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise, and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms. Rulings in third party legal proceedings, increased scrutiny by antitrust authorities and the outcome of potential patent legislation, USPTO rule changes and international patent rule changes may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and may increase our costs of doing business. The potential effect of rulings in legal proceedings among third parties may affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing, and enforcement. In addition, domestic and foreign antitrust authorities have recently increased their scrutiny of the use of “standard essential patents” in the mobile wireless industry, including the enforcement of such patents against competitors. Such scrutiny may lead to an increase in antitrust inquiries and/or enforcement actions and/or impact the availability of injunctive and monetary relief, which may adversely affect our strategies for patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement and increase our costs of operation. Finally, changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws, rules and regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may affect our costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure and remedies we may be entitled to in patent litigation, and may require us to reevaluate and modify our patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies. We continue to monitor and evaluate our strategies for prosecution, licensing and enforcement with regard to these developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Consolidation in the wireless communications industry could adversely affect our business. The wireless communications industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses, and these trends may continue. Any concentration or sale within the wireless industry may reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations. Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial condition. We face risks from doing business in international markets. A significant portion of our licensees are international, and our licensees sell their products to markets throughout the world. Accordingly, we could be subject to the effects of a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; currency control regulations and variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency; social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; and general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments. In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we and our licensees do business. Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, uncertainty and shifting market opportunities. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes in industry Standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements. Changes in industry Standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. The patents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, 26Table of Contentstechnology solutions or both.  The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses, deploy and expand wireless networks and obtain new subscribers could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely affect our business. Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers. The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks. The growth of our business could be adversely affected if this occurs. Market projections and data are forward-looking in nature. Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on wireless devices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions. In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate. The inaccuracy of any of these projections and/or market data could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The markets for our technology solutions may fail to materialize in the manner we expect. We are positioning our current development projects for the evolving advanced digital wireless markets. Certain of these markets may continue to develop at a slower rate or pace than we expect and may be of a smaller size than we expect. In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect. The development of advanced wireless markets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of advanced wireless infrastructure and mobile devices, rate of growth in telecommunications services and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, radio frequency licenses and infrastructure improvements. Failure of the markets for our technologies and/or our products to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect could reduce our opportunities for sales and licensing and could materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial condition and operating results.We face competition from companies developing other or similar technologies. We face competition from companies, including the in-house development teams at wireless device and semiconductor manufacturing companies and operators, developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our solutions that we may set forth into the Standards setting arena.  Due to competing solutions, our solutions may not be adopted by the relevant Standards.  In addition, in licensing our patent portfolio, we may compete with other companies, many of whom also claim to hold essential patents, for a share of the available royalties.  In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain a license from multiple holders of intellectual property.  To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder.  Our technology development activities may experience delays. We may experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies. Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain an advantage over us in the Standards setting arena. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful. Moreover, certain of our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected. In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new licensees and other business opportunities could be diminished. We rely on relationships with third parties to develop and deploy technology solutions. Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industry participants. Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreements to 27Table of Contentssecure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or impair our ability to remain competitive.    Changes in financial accounting standards or policies may affect our reported financial condition or results of operations. From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and the SEC change their guidance governing the form and content of our external financial statements.  In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), such as the FASB, the SEC and the company's outside auditors, may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions with regard to how these standards should be applied.  A change in accounting principles or their interpretation can have a significant effect on our reported results.  In certain cases, the company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently.  For example, in November 2011, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board released an updated exposure draft, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which, if it becomes final, could significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition for new and existing contracts with licensees. This and other potential changes in reporting standards could substantially change our reporting practices in a number of areas, including revenue recognition and recording of assets and liabilities, and affect our reported financial condition or results of operations.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our activities and international strategic investments. We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which may change over time as our business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition. We operate and invest globally. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following: •If the effective price of products sold by our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues. •Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect our reported earnings. Our exposure to foreign currencies may increase as we expand into new markets. •Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies. If these costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengthening currency values in selected regions could adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows. In addition, continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over an extended period of time could adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows. Unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information could adversely affect our business. We enter into contractual relationships governing the protection of our confidential and proprietary information with our employees, consultants and prospective and existing licensees and strategic partners. If we are unable to detect in a timely manner the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary or other confidential information or if we are unable to enforce our rights under such agreements, the misappropriation of such information could harm our business. If wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks, demand for products of our licensees could decrease. Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate medical equipment. Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the products of our licensees. In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for the products of our licensees. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the NotesThe price of our common stock is volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance. Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our common stock, and such fluctuations could continue. From January 1, 2009 to February 24, 2012, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $18.41 per share to a high of $82.50 per share. The market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including: •market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other wireless communications companies generally;28Table of Contents•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;•changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;•the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC and announcements relating to licensing, technology development, litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings in which we are involved and intellectual property impacting us or our business;•announcements concerning strategic transactions, such as spin-offs, joint ventures and acquisitions or divestitures;•investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-term goals;•changes in market share of significant licensees; and•announcements of mergers or acquisition transactions.In addition, the stock markets, and in particular the NASDAQ Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business. Our increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness. Our total consolidated long-term debt as of December 31, 2011 was approximately $230.0 million. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: •making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our 2.50% senior convertible notes due 2016 (the “Notes”);•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Notes. Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the Notes and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on any other future outstanding indebtedness. Our stockholders may not receive the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or any dividend at all, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline. Our initial dividend policy, adopted and announced in December 2010, contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share on our outstanding common stock. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, the dividend policy and the payment of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends, including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in our best interests, which determination will be based on a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. Given these considerations, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future. Any decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could 29Table of Contentscause our stock price to decline.If securities or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is possible that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.The convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes may affect our earnings per share and/or the market price for our common stock. In connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with an affiliate of the initial purchaser (the “option counterparty”). We also sold warrants to the option counterparty. These transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders' equity. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the Notes. The warrants will have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per common share of our common stock, as measured under the warrants, exceeds the strike price of the warrants at the time the warrants are exercisable.  In connection with establishing its initial hedge of these transactions, the option counterparty (and/or an affiliate thereof) purchased our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions and/or entered various cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes. The option counterparty (and/or an affiliate thereof) may modify its hedge positions from time to time (including during any conversion period related to a conversion of the Notes) by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or by purchasing or selling our common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Future sales or other dilution of our equity could depress the market price of our common stock. Sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. We also have several institutional stockholders that own significant blocks of our common stock. If one or more of these stockholders were to sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, for liquidity or other reasons, the prevailing market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. Under certain circumstances, shares of our common stock could be issued upon conversion of the Notes, which would dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. In addition, the issuance of additional common stock, or issuances of securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock or other equity linked securities, including preferred stock or warrants, would dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders and could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Approved stock repurchase programs may not result in a positive return of capital to stockholders. Our board-approved stock repurchase program may not return value to stockholders because the market price of the stock may decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver stockholder value over the long term, but stock price fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs.Provisions of the Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party. Certain provisions of the Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, including the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such Notes. We may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain 30Table of Contentsfundamental change transactions. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing an acquisition of us by a third party.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.The option counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that the option counterparty may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate their obligations, under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparty will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the option counterparty become subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparty"
13,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2011-02-28,">Item 1A.  RISK    FACTORS.     We face a variety of risks that may affect our business,    financial condition, operating results or any combination    thereof. Although many of the risks and uncertainties discussed    below are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict,    you should carefully consider the identified risks and    uncertainties and other information contained in this    Form 10-K    in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an    investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of    the following risks or uncertainties occur or develop, our    business, results of operations and financial condition could be    adversely affected. In such an event, the market price of our    common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of    your investment. The following discussion addresses those risks    that management believes are the most significant and that may    affect our business, financial condition or operating results,    although there are other risks that could arise or may become    more significant than anticipated.    24Table of ContentsRisks    Relating to Our Revenue, Cash Flow, and    Expenses Challenges    Relating to Our Ability to Enter into New License Agreements    Could Cause Our Revenue and Cash Flow to Decline.     We face challenges in entering into new patent license    agreements. The strength of our patent portfolio is an important    factor in securing new license agreements and accompanying    revenues. We have a broad worldwide portfolio of pending and    issued patents covering a variety of wireless technologies.    However, certain of our inventions that we believe will be    employed in current and future products, including 4G products,    are the subject of patent applications where no patent has been    issued to us yet by the relevant patent issuing authorities.    There is no assurance that these applications will issue as    patents, either at all or with claims that would be required by    products in the market currently or in the future. In addition,    during discussions with unlicensed companies, the strength of    our patent portfolio may be challenged and significant    negotiation issues arise from time to time. For example, in the    ordinary course of negotiations, in response to our demand that    prospective customers enter into a license agreement, such    prospective customers have raised and may continue to raise a    variety of arguments, including, but not limited to:    (i) claims challenging the essential nature of our patents;    (ii) claims that their products do not infringe certain of    our patents or that certain of our patents are invalid or    unenforceable; (iii) claims that not all of our patents are    applicable to their products and, thus, certain patents should    be excluded from the license; (iv) claims that our royalty    base should be limited to discrete functionality;    (v) claims that our royalty rates are not fair, reasonable    or nondiscriminatory; (vi) claims that their products are    already subject to a license; (vii) claims that another    entity in the distribution chain is a more appropriate licensing    target; and (viii) claims that they are indemnified by a    third party. In addition, prospective customers may raise    concerns regarding the potential impact that any litigation,    arbitration or other proceeding in which we are involved may    have on such prospective customers. We cannot assure that all    prospective customers will be persuaded during negotiations to    enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or    on terms acceptable to us, and, as a result, our revenue and    cash flow could materially decline. Our    Revenue May Be Impacted by the Deployment of 4G or Other    Technologies in Place of 2G and 3G Technologies or by the Need    to Extend or Modify Certain Existing License Agreements to Cover    Additional Later    Patents.     Although we own a growing portfolio of issued and pending    patents related to 4G and non-cellular technologies, our patent    portfolio licensing program in these areas is less established    and may not be as successful in generating licensing income as    our 2G and 3G licensing programs. Many wireless operators are    investigating or have selected LTE (or to a lesser extent WiMax)    as next-generation technologies for deployment in existing or    future spectrum bands as complementary to their existing 2G or    3G networks. Although we believe that certain of our technology    is, may be or may become essential to LTE and WiMax Standards,    we may not be as successful in licensing 4G products as we have    been in licensing 2G and 3G products or we may not achieve a    level of royalty revenues on such 4G products that is comparable    to that we have historically received on 2G and 3G products.     The licenses that we grant under our patent license agreements    typically only cover products designated to operate in    accordance with specified cellular technologies. As a result, we    have patent license agreements that do not cover products    designed to operate in accordance with technologies that have    yet to be deployed or are in the early stages of deployment. For    example, most of our patent licenses cover products designed to    operate in accordance with GSM    and/or    WCDMA, but not LTE or Wi-Max. Also, we have patent license    agreements with customers that now offer for sale products that    were not sold by such customer at the time the patent license    agreement was entered into and, thus, are not licensed by us. We    do not derive patent licensing revenue from the sale of products    by our customers that are not covered by a patent license    agreement. In order to grant a patent license for any such    products, we will need to extend or modify our patent license    agreements or enter into new license agreements with such    customers. We may not be able to modify these license agreements    on financial terms acceptable agreeable to us, without affecting    the other material terms and conditions of our license    agreements with such customers, or at all. Further, such    modifications may adversely affect our revenue on the sale of    products covered by the license prior to modification.    25Table of ContentsOur    Revenue and Cash Flow Are Dependent Upon Our Customers    Sales and Market Conditions.     A significant portion of our licensing revenues are running    royalty-based and currently dependent on sales by our customers    that are outside our control and that could be negatively    affected by a variety of factors, including global    and/or    country-specific economic conditions, buying patterns of end    users, competition for our customers products and any    decline in the sale prices our customers receive for their    covered products. In addition, our operating results also could    be affected by general economic and other conditions that cause    a downturn in the market for the customers of our products or    technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected    by (i) the unwillingness of any customer to satisfy all of    their royalty obligations on the terms or within the timeframe    we expect or a decline in the financial condition of any    customer or (ii) the failure of sales to meet market    forecasts due to global economic conditions, political    instability, competitive technologies or otherwise. It is also    difficult to predict the timing and amount of licensing revenue    associated with past infringement and new licenses and the    timing, nature or amount of revenues associated with strategic    partnerships. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast    and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual    operating results and financial condition. In addition, some of    our patent license agreements provide for fixed payments or    prepayments that cover our customers future sales for a    specified period and reduce future cash receipts from those    customers. As a result, our cash flow has historically    fluctuated from period to period. Depending upon the payment    structure of any new patent license agreements into which we may    enter, such cash flow fluctuations may continue in the future. Royalty    Rates Could Decrease for Future License    Agreements.     Royalty payments to us under future license agreements could be    lower than anticipated. Certain customers and others in the    wireless industry, individually and collectively, are demanding    that royalty rates for patents be lower than historic royalty    rates. There is also increasing downward pricing pressure on    certain products that we believe implement our patented    inventions. In addition, a number of companies have made claims    as to the essential nature of their patents with respect to    products for the cellular market. The increasing pricing    pressure, as well as the number of patent holders of cellular    technologies, could result in a decrease in the royalty rates we    receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing    future anticipated revenue and cash flow. Our    Revenues Are Derived Primarily from a Limited Number of    Customers.     The mobile device market is very concentrated. As a result, we    earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number    of customers, and we expect that a significant portion of our    revenues will continue to come from a limited number of    customers for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2010,    Samsung and LG comprised approximately 26% and 15% of our total    revenues, respectively. In the event that one or more of our    significant customers fail to meet their payment or reporting    obligations under their respective license agreements, we lose    any of these customers or our revenues from these customers    significantly decline, our future revenue and cash flow could be    materially adversely affected. Delays    in Renewing or an Inability to Renew Existing License Agreements    Could Cause Our Revenue and Cash Flow to Decline.     Many of our license agreements have fixed terms. We endeavor to    renew license agreements with fixed terms prior to the    expiration of the license agreements and, based on various    factors, including the technology and business needs and    competitive positions of our customers, we may not be able to    renegotiate the license agreements on acceptable terms before    the expiration of the license agreement, on acceptable terms    after the expiration of the license agreement, or at all. If    there is a delay in renegotiating and renewing a license    agreement prior to its expiration, there could be a gap in time    during which we may be unable to recognize revenue from that    customer or we may be forced to renegotiate and renew the    license agreement on terms that are more favorable to such    customer, and, as a result, our revenue and cash flow could be    materially adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to    renegotiate and renew our license agreements at all, we could    lose existing customers, and our revenue and cash flow could be    materially adversely affected.    26Table of ContentsIt Can    Be Difficult for Us to Verify Royalty Amounts Owed to Us Under    Our Licensing Agreements, and This May Cause Us to Lose    Potential Revenue.     The standard terms of our license agreements require our    customers to document the sale of licensed products and report    this data to us on a quarterly basis. Although our standard    license terms give us the right to audit books and records of    our customers to verify this information, audits can be    expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute.    From time to time, we audit certain of our customers to verify    independently the accuracy of the information contained in their    royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we    will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled    under the terms of our license agreements, but we cannot give    assurances that these audits will be numerous enough    and/or    effective to that end. Challenges    in Defending and Enforcing Our Patent Rights Could Cause Our    Revenue and Cash Flow to Decline.     Major telecommunications equipment manufacturers have    challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge the    infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our    patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims could    be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable,    not essential or not infringed. We cannot assure that the    validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or    that certain of our patents will be determined to be applicable    to any particular product or Standard. Moreover, third parties    could attempt to circumvent certain of our patents through    design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the    validity, enforceability or scope of certain of our patents    and/or any    successful design-around of certain patents could result in the    loss of patent licensing revenue from existing customers,    through termination or modification of agreements or otherwise,    and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent    licensing arrangements, either at all or on beneficial terms. Consolidation    in the Wireless Communications Industry Could Adversely Affect    Our Business.     The wireless communications industry has experienced    consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their    businesses, and these trends may continue. Any concentration or    sale within the wireless industry may reduce the number of    licensing opportunities or, in some instances, result in the    reduction, loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations.    Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that    utilize technologies that are competitive with our technologies    or that are not covered by our patents, we could lose market    opportunities, which could negatively impact our revenues and    financial condition. Due to    the Nature of Our Business, We Could Be Involved in a Number of    Litigation, Arbitration and Administrative Proceedings to    Enforce Our Intellectual Property Rights.     While some companies seek licenses before they commence    manufacturing    and/or    selling devices that use our patented inventions, most do not.    Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish    license agreements for using our inventions. We expend    significant time and effort identifying potential users of our    inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies    that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe    that a third party is required to take a license to our patents    in order to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, import, or use    products, we may commence legal or administrative action against    the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement    with us. In turn, we could face counterclaims that challenge the    essential nature of our patents, that our patents are invalid,    unenforceable or not infringed or that our royalty rates are    other than fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. As a result    of enforcing our patents, we could be subject to significant    legal fees and costs, including the costs and fees of opposing    counsel in certain jurisdictions if we are unsuccessful. In    addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings    require significant key employee involvement for significant    periods of time, which could divert these employees from other    business activities.     In addition, the cost of enforcing and defending our    intellectual property has been and may continue to be    significant. Litigation may be required to enforce our    intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce    patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the    validity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of    others. In addition, third parties could commence litigation    against us seeking to invalidate our patents or obtain a    determination that our patents are not infringed, are not    essential, are invalid or are unenforceable. As a result of any    such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur    substantial unexpected operating costs.    27Table of Contents    Any action we take to protect our intellectual property rights    could be costly and could require significant amounts of time by    key members of executive management and other personnel. Risks    Related to Our Business Operations, Strategy, Markets and    Competition We    Depend on Key Senior Management, Engineering, Patent, and    Licensing Resources.     Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of    our directors, executive officers and other key management and    technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to    continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel    with specialized patent, licensing, engineering and other    skills. The market for such talent in our industry is extremely    competitive. In particular, competition exists for qualified    individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and with    significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface    technologies. Our ability to attract and retain qualified    personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions in any    litigation or arbitration, by our ability to offer competitive    cash and equity compensation and work environment conditions and    by the geographical location of our various offices. The failure    to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate    experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new    license agreements and undertake additional technology and    product development efforts, as well as our ability to meet our    strategic objectives. We    Face Risks from Doing Business in International    Markets.     A significant portion of our customers are international, and    our customers sell their products to markets throughout the    world. Accordingly, we could be subject to the effects of a    variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, but    not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual    property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual    commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign    corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other    applicable trade barriers; currency control regulations and    variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign    currency; social, economic and political instability; natural    disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war;    potentially adverse tax consequences; and general delays in    remittance of and difficulties collecting    non-U.S. payments.    In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the    individual countries in which we and our customers do business. Our    Industry Is Subject to Rapid Technological Change, Uncertainty    and Shifting Market Opportunities.     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep    pace with changes in industry Standards, technological    developments and varying customer requirements. Changes in    industry Standards and needs could adversely affect the    development of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our    technology currently under development obsolete and    unmarketable. The patents and applications comprising our    portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipate or    respond adequately to these changes through the development or    acquisition of new patentable inventions, patents or other    technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity,    reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our    patents, technology solutions or both. Our    Technologies May Not Be Adopted By the Market or Widely    Deployed.     We invest significant engineering resources in the development    of advanced wireless technology and related solutions. These    investments may not be recoverable or may not result in    meaningful revenue if products based on the technologies in    which we invest are not widely deployed. Competing digital    wireless technologies could reduce the opportunities for    deployment of technologies we develop. If the technologies in    which we invest are not adopted in the mainstream markets or    within time periods we expect, or if we are unable to secure    partner support for our technologies, our business, financial    condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We May    Engage in Acquisitions or Strategic Transactions or Make    Investments That Could Result in Significant Changes or    Management Disruption and Fail to Enhance Shareholder    Value.     We continue to evaluate and may acquire businesses, technology    and/or    intellectual property, enter into joint ventures or other    strategic transactions and purchase equity and debt securities    in other entities, including minority equity interests and    corporate bonds/notes in publicly-traded and privately-held    companies. In some cases, such strategic investments may serve    as consideration for a license in lieu of cash royalties. Most    strategic investments    28Table of Contents    entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid until    more than one year from the date of investment, if at all.    Acquisitions or strategic investments may not generate financial    returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our    technologies. In addition, other investments may not generate    financial returns or may result in losses due to market    volatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation    expectations. We could make strategic investments in early-stage    companies, which require us to consolidate or record our share    of the earnings or losses of those companies. Our share of any    such losses may adversely affect our financial results until we    exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments.     Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in    part upon our ability to integrate the acquired businesses in an    efficient and effective manner. The integration of acquired    companies may result in significant challenges, and we may be    unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully.    We cannot assure you that the integration of acquired businesses    with our business will result in the realization of the full    benefits we anticipate to result from such acquisitions. We may    not derive any commercial value from the acquired technology,    products and intellectual property or from future technologies    and products based on the acquired technology    and/or    intellectual property, and we may be subject to liabilities that    are not covered by the indemnification protection we may obtain. The    High Amount of Capital Required to Obtain Radio Frequency    Licenses, Deploy and Expand Wireless Networks and Obtain New    Subscribers Could Slow the Growth of the Wireless Communications    Industry and Adversely Affect Our Business.     Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless    communications services that utilize our technology. In order to    provide wireless communications services, wireless operators    must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The    allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United States and    other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space    is allocated to wireless communications services. Industry    growth may be affected by the amount of capital required to    obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks    to offer voice and data services, expand wireless networks to    grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers. The    significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber    additions may slow the growth of the industry if wireless    operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital    necessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks. The    growth of our business could be adversely affected if this    occurs. Market    Projections and Data Are Forward-Looking in    Nature.     Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst,    industry observer and expert projections, which are    forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks    and uncertainties. The validity of their and our assumptions,    the timing and scope of wireless markets, economic conditions,    customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development,    pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications    services that would be delivered on wireless devices and    availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could    affect these predictions. In addition, market data upon which we    rely is based on third party reports that may be inaccurate. The    inaccuracy of any of these projections    and/or    market data could adversely affect our operating results and    financial condition. The    Markets for Our Technology Solutions May Fail to Materialize in    the Manner We Expect.     We are positioning our current development projects for the    evolving advanced digital wireless markets. Certain of these    markets may continue to develop at a slower rate or pace than we    expect and may be of a smaller size than we expect. In addition,    there could be fewer applications for our technology and    products than we expect. The development of advanced wireless    markets also could be affected by general economic conditions,    customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development,    pricing of advanced wireless infrastructure and mobile devices,    rate of growth in telecommunications services and the    availability of capital for, and the high cost of, radio    frequency licenses and infrastructure improvements. Failure of    the markets for our technologies    and/or our    products to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect    could reduce our opportunities for sales and licensing and could    materially adversely affect our long-term business, financial    condition and operating results.    29Table of ContentsWe    Face Competition from Companies with Greater    Resources.     Competition in the wireless telecommunications industry is    intense. We face competition from companies developing other and    similar technologies, including existing companies with in-house    development teams, such as Qualcomm, Ericsson and Nokia, and new    competitors to the market. Many current and potential    competitors may have advantages over us, including:    (i) longer operating histories and presence in key markets;    (ii) greater name recognition; (iii) access to larger    customer bases; (iv) economies of scale and cost structure    advantages; and (v) greater financial, sales and marketing,    manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources. Our    Technology Development Activities May Experience    Delays.     We may experience technical, financial, resource or other    difficulties or delays related to the further development of our    technologies. Delays may have adverse financial effects and may    allow competitors with comparable technology offerings to gain a    commercial advantage over us. There can be no assurance that we    will continue to have adequate staffing or that our development    efforts will ultimately be successful. Moreover, certain of our    technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and    it is possible that they may not perform as expected. In such    cases, our business, financial condition and operating results    could be adversely affected, and our ability to secure new    customers and other business opportunities could be diminished. We    Rely on Relationships with Third Parties to Develop and Deploy    Technology Solutions.     Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially    dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with    equipment producers and other industry participants. Delays or    failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to    facilitate technology development efforts or delays or failure    to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure    integration of additional functionality could impair our ability    to introduce into the market portions of our technology and    resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windows or    impair our ability to remain competitive. Other    Risks The    Outcome of Potential Domestic Patent Legislation, USPTO    Rule Changes, International Patent Rule Changes and    Third Party Legal Proceedings May Affect Our Patent Costs and    Patent Prosecution, Licensing and Enforcement    Strategies.     Changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws and    regulations may occur in the future, some or all of which may    affect our patent costs, the scope of future patent coverage we    secure and remedies we may be awarded in patent litigation, and    may require us to reevaluate and modify our patent prosecution,    licensing and enforcement strategies. In addition, the potential    effect of rulings in legal proceedings among third parties may    affect our patent prosecution, licensing, and enforcement    efforts. We continue to monitor and evaluate our prosecution,    licensing and enforcement strategies with regard to these    developments; however, any resulting change in such strategies    may have an adverse impact on our business and financial    condition. The    Price of Our Common Stock Could Continue to be    Volatile.     Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our    common stock, and such fluctuations could continue. From    January 1, 2006 to February 25, 2011, our common stock has    traded as low as $16.20 per share and as high as $58.64 per    share. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in our stock    price include, but are not limited to: general stock market    conditions; general market conditions for the wireless    communications industry; changes in recommendations of    securities analysts; investor perceptions as to the likelihood    of achievement of near-term goals; changes in market share of    significant customers; announcements concerning litigation,    arbitration and other legal proceedings in which we are    involved; announcements concerning licensing and product    matters; strategic transactions, such as spin-offs, joint    ventures and acquisitions or divestitures; and our operating    results.    30Table of ContentsOur    Stockholders May Not Receive the Level of Dividends Provided for    in Our Divided Policy or Any Dividend at All, and Any Decrease    in or Suspension of the Dividend Could Cause Our Stock Price to    Decline.     Our initial dividend policy, adopted and announced in December    2010, contemplates the payment of a regular quarterly cash    dividend of $0.10 per share on the Companys outstanding    common stock. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash    dividends on our common stock at the rate set forth in our    current dividend policy. However, the dividend policy and the    payment of future cash dividends under the policy are subject to    the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors    that (i) the dividend will be made in compliance with laws    applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends,    including Section 1551(b) of the Pennsylvania Business    Corporation Law, and (ii) the policy remains in the best    interests of the Company, which determination will be based on a    number of factors, including the Companys earnings,    financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements,    alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any    existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered    relevant by the Board of Directors. Given these considerations,    our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of    the dividend at any time and may also decide to suspend or    discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future. Any    decrease in the amount of the dividend, or suspension or    discontinuance of payment of a dividend, could cause our stock    price to decline. Approved    Stock Repurchase Programs May Not Result in a Positive Return of    Capital to Stockholders.     Our approved stock repurchases may not return value to    stockholders because the market price of the stock may decline    significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of    stock. Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver    stockholder value over the long term, but stock price    fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of such programs. Changes    to Our Tax Assets or Liabilities Could Have an Adverse Effect on    Our Consolidated Financial Condition or Results of    Operations.     The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves    significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties    in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to    examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other    taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including    challenges to various positions we assert in our filings and    foreign tax liability and withholding. With our January 1,    2007 adoption of the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in    income taxes, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they    are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we    believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for    tax contingencies that meet this criterion, we may not fully    recover our tax assets or may be required to pay taxes in excess    of the amounts we have accrued. As of December 31, 2010 and    2009, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the    applicable criteria to record an accrual. In the event that the    IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the    future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse    effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of    operations. Currency    Fluctuations Could Negatively Affect Future Product Sales or    Royalty Revenues or Increase the U.S. Dollar Cost of Our    Activities and International Strategic    Investments.     We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which    may change over time as our business practices evolve, that    could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial    condition. We operate and invest globally. Adverse movements in    currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due    to a number of situations, including the following:           If the effective price of products sold by our customers were to    increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the    relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which    in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.           Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries may be    subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may    affect our reported earnings. Our exposure to foreign currencies    may increase as we expand into new markets.           Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign    patent prosecution, are based in foreign currencies. If these    costs are not subject to foreign exchange hedging transactions,    strengthening currency values in selected regions could    adversely affect our near-term operating expenses, investment    costs and    31Table of Contents     cash flows. In addition, continued strengthening of currency    values in selected regions over an extended period of time could    adversely affect our future operating expenses, investment costs    and cash flows. Unauthorized    Use or Disclosure of Our Confidential Information Could    Adversely Affect Our Business.     We enter into contractual relationships governing the protection    of our confidential and proprietary information with our    employees, consultants and prospective and existing customers    and strategic partners. If we are unable to detect in a timely    manner the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary or    other confidential information or if we are unable to enforce    our rights under such agreements, the misappropriation of such    information could harm our business. If    Wireless Handsets Are Perceived to Pose Health and Safety Risks,    Demand for Products of Our Customers Could    Decrease.     Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio    frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to    health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and    genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic    medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate    medical equipment. Growing concerns over radio frequency    emissions, even if unfounded, could discourage the use of    wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the    products of our customers. In addition, concerns over safety    risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and    the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for    the products of our customers. "
10,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2010-02-26,">Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.     We face a variety of risks that might affect our business, financial condition, operatingresults or any combination thereof. Although many of the risks and uncertainties discussed beloware driven by factors that we cannot control or predict, you should carefully consider theidentified risks and uncertainties and other information contained in this Form 10-K in evaluatingour business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our commonstock. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur or develop, our business, results ofoperations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In such an event, the market priceof our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The followingdiscussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most21Table of Contentssignificant and that mightaffect our business, financial condition or operating results, although there are other risks thatcould arise or might become more significant than anticipated.Risks Relating to Our Revenues and Cash Flow  Challenges Relating to Our Ability to Enter into New License Agreements Could Cause OurRevenues and Cash Flow to Decline.     We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements. During discussionswith unlicensed companies, significant negotiation issues arise fromtime to time. For example,manufacturers and sellers of 2G products could be reluctant to enter into a license agreementbecause such companies might be required to make significant payments for unlicensed past sales.Moreover, a significant part of our TDMA patent portfolio expired in 2006. Also, certain of theinventions we believe will be employed in 3G products and other future technologies are the subjectof our patent applications where no patent has been issued yet by the relevant patent reviewingauthorities. Certain prospective licensees are unwilling to license patent rights prior to apatents issuance. Additionally, in the ordinary course of negotiations, in response to our demandthat they enter into a license agreement, manufacturers raise different defenses and arguments,including, but not limited to: (i) claims by third parties challenging the essential nature of ourpatents; (ii) claims that their products do not infringe our patents or that our patents areinvalid or unenforceable; (iii) certain patents should be excluded from the license; (iv) ourroyalty rates are not fair, reasonable or nondiscriminatory;(v) that their products are already subject to a license; and(vi) the potential impact that anylitigation or arbitration in which we are involved might have on such manufacturers. We cannotassure that all prospective licensees will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patentlicense agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us.  Our Revenue and Cash Flow Are Dependent Upon Our Licensees Sales and Market Conditions.     A significant portion of our licensing revenues are royalty-based and currently dependent onsales by our licensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by avariety of factors, including global and/or country-specific economic conditions, buying patternsof end users, competition for our licensees products and any decline in the sale prices ourlicensees receive for their covered products. In addition, our operating results also could beaffected by general economic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for thecustomers of our products or technologies. Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by(i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms orwithin the timeframe we expect or a decline in the financial condition of any licensee or (ii) thefailure of sales to meet market forecasts due to global economic conditions,political instability, competitive technologies or otherwise. It is also difficult to predict thetiming and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement and new licenses and thetiming, nature or amount of revenues associated with strategic partnerships. The foregoing factorsare difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operatingresults and financial condition.  Royalty Rates Could Decrease for Future License Agreements.     Certain licensees and others in the wireless industry, individually and collectively, aredemanding that royalty rates for  patents be lower than historic royalty rates and, insome cases, that the aggregate royalty rates for  patentsproducts be capped. There is increasing downward pricing pressure oncertain products that we believe implement our patented inventions.Also, a number ofcompanies have made claims as to the essential nature of their patents with respect to products forthe cellular market.  The increasing pricing pressure, as well as the  number of patent holders of 3G and future technologies and theefforts, if successful, by certain industry members and groups to reduce and/or place caps onroyalty rates for  3G and future technologies could result in a decrease in the royalty rates wereceive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future anticipated revenue and cashflow.  Our Revenues Are Derived Primarily from a Limited Number of Patent Licensees.     We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees, and weexpect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number oflicensees for the foreseeable future. In the event one or more of these licensees fail to meettheir payment or reporting obligations under their respective license agreements, we lose any ofthese licensees or our revenues from these licensees decline, our future revenue and cash flowcould be materially adversely affected.  It Can Be Difficult for Us to Verify Royalty Amounts Owed to Us Under Our LicensingAgreements, and This Might Cause Us to Lose Revenues.     The standard terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document the sale of licensed  products  and report this data to us on aquarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and recordsof our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete,subject to dispute and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our licensees.From time to time, we  audit certain of our  licensees to verify independently the accuracy of theinformation contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we willnot receive the royalty22Table of Contentsrevenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our licenseagreements, but we cannot give assurances that these random audits will be effective to that end.  Challenges Relating to Our Existing License Agreements Could Cause Our Revenue and Cash Flowto Decline.     Revenue and cash flow from existing and potential licensees might be affected bychallenges to our interpretation of license agreement provisionsand from downward industry pricing pressure on certain products.Such challenges or difficultiescould result in requests to renegotiate, rejection or modification of license agreements or the termination, reduction andsuspension of payments.     Some of our license agreements have fixed terms. We will need to renew license agreementswith fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements and, based on various factors,including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees, we mightnot be able to renegotiate the license agreements on similar terms, or at all. In order to maintainexisting relationships with some of our licensees, we might be forced to renegotiate licenseagreements on terms that are more favorable to the licensees, which could harm our results ofoperations. If we fail to renegotiate our license agreements, we would lose existing licensees, andour business could be materially adversely affected.For example, our patent license agreement with LG expires at the endof 2010. If we are unable to renew this agreement either at all or onbeneficial terms this would adversely affect our revenue.  Challenges in Defending and Enforcing Our Patent Rights Could Cause Our Revenue and Cash Flowto Decline.     Major telecommunications equipment manufacturers have challenged, and we expect willcontinue to challenge the  infringement, validity and enforceability of our patents. In someinstances, certain of our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid,unenforceable, not essential or not infringed. We cannot assure that the validity andenforceability of our patents will be maintained or that any of our key patents will be determinedto be applicable to any particular product or Standard. Moreover, third parties could circumventcertain of our patents through design changes. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity,enforceability or scope of our key patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenuefrom existing licensees and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensingarrangements.  Our Engineering Services Business Could Subject Us to Specific Costs and Risks That We MightFail to Manage Adequately.      Wederive a portion of our revenues from engineering services. Anymismanagement of, or negative development in, a number of areas, including,among others, the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, our ability to convincecustomers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under ourservice contracts, could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline, damage ourreputation and harm our ability to attract future licensees, which would in turn harm our operatingresults. If we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts, we could lose revenues andbecome subject to liability for breach of contract. We need to monitor these services adequately inorder to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating correspondingrevenues. Our failure to monitor these services adequately may harm our business, financialposition, results of operations or cash flows.  Our Business and Operations Would Suffer in the Event of a Natural Disaster or OtherCatastrophe.      Our business and operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities,computer systems and personnel. Our locations could be subject to natural disasters or othercatastrophes. Although we have and maintain disaster recovery plans, such plans have limitations. Anatural disaster or other catastrophe could still disable our facilities and/or systems, whichcould result in a material disruption to our business. In addition, we could incur additional coststo remedy the damages caused by these disruptions.Risks Relating to Our Expenses  Due to the Nature of Our Business, We Could Be Involved in a Number of Litigation, Arbitrationand Administrative Proceedings to Enforce Our Patent Rights.     While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or sellingdevices that use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seekto establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant effort identifyingpotential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that might bereluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a licenseto our patents in order to manufacture, sell or use products, we might commence legal oradministrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement. Inturn, we could face counterclaims that challenge the essential nature of our patents, that ourpatents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed or that our royalty rates are not fair,reasonable or nondiscriminatory. As a result of enforcing our patents, we could be subject tosignificant legal fees and costs, including the costs and fees of opposing counsel in certainjurisdictions if we are unsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrativeproceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, whichcould divert these employees from other business activities.     In addition, the cost of defending our intellectual property has been and might continueto be significant. Litigation might be required to enforce our intellectual property rights,protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine thevalidity, enforceability and scope of proprietary rights of others. In addition, third partiescould commence litigation against us seeking to invalidate our patents or to have determined thatour patents are not infringed, or are not essential or invalid or unenforceable. As a result of anysuch litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur substantial unexpected operatingcosts. Any action we take to protect our23Table of Contentsintellectual property rights could be costly and couldrequire significant amounts of time by key members of executive management and other personnel.  We Might Need to Defend Against Claims by Third Parties that We Infringe TheirIntellectual Property.     A number of third parties publicly have claimed that they own patents essential tovarious wireless Standards. Certain of our technology solutions are designed to comply with theseStandards. If any of our technology solutions are found to infringe the intellectual propertyrights of a third party, we could be required to redesign the technology solutions, take a licensefrom the third party, pay damages to the third party or indemnify a customer or supplier for itsdamages or other losses. If we are not able to negotiate a license and/or if we cannot economicallyredesign the technology solutions, we could be prohibited from marketing the technology solutions.In this case, our prospects for realizing future revenue could be adversely affected. If we arerequired to obtain licenses and/or pay royalties to one or more patent holders, this could have anadverse effect on the commercial implementation and profitability  of our wireless technology solutions. In addition,the associated costs to defend such claims could be significant and could divert the attention ofkey executive management and other personnel.Risks Related to Our Business Strategy, Markets and Competition  We Depend on Key Senior Management, Engineering and Licensing Resources.     Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our directors, executiveofficers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our abilityto continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized licensing,engineering and other skills. The market for such specialized talent in our industry is extremelycompetitive. In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise inlicensing and with significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface technologies.Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions inany litigation or arbitration and by our ability to offer competitive cash and equity compensationand work environment conditions. The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant andappropriate experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements andundertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as our ability to meet ourstrategic objectives.  We Face Risks from Doing Business in Global Markets.     A significant portion of our business opportunities exist in a number of internationalmarkets. Accordingly, we could be subject to the effects of a variety of uncontrollable andchanging factors, including, but not limited to: difficulty in protecting our intellectual propertyin foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or againstforeign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; currencycontrol regulations and variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency;social, economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespreadillness and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; and general delays in remittance of anddifficulties collecting non-U.S. payments. In addition, we also are subject to risks specific tothe individual countries in which we, our customers and our licensees do business.  Our Industry Is Subject to Rapid Technological Change, Uncertainty and Shifting MarketOpportunities.     Our market success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changesin industry Standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements. Changes inindustry Standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, ourtechnology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. Thepatents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms, and, if we fail to anticipateor respond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentableinventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing oreliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.     Our Technologies Might Not Be Adopted By the Market or Widely Deployed.     We invest significant engineering resources in the development of advanced wirelesstechnology and related solutions. These investments might not be recoverable or might not result inmeaningful revenue if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely24Table of Contentsdeployed. Competing digital wireless technologies could reduce the opportunities for deployment oftechnologies we develop. If the technologies in which we invest are not adopted in the mainstreammarkets or in time periods we expect, or if we are unable to secure partner support for ourtechnologies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.  The Markets for Our Technology Solutions Might Fail to Materialize in the Manner WeExpect.     We are positioning our current development projects for the evolving advanced digitalwireless markets. Certain of these markets might continue to develop at a slower rate or pace thanwe expect and might be of a smaller size than we expect. In addition, there could be fewerapplications for our technology and products than we expect. The development of advanced wirelessmarkets also could be affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timelinessof equipment development, pricing of advanced wireless infrastructure and mobile devices, rate ofgrowth in telecommunications services and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of,radio frequency licenses and infrastructure improvements. Failure of the markets for ourtechnologies and/or our products to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect could reduceour opportunities for sales and licensing and could materially adversely affect our long-termbusiness, financial condition and operating results.  The High Amount of Capital Required to Obtain Radio Frequency Licenses, Deploy and ExpandWireless Networks and Obtain New Subscribers Could Slow the Growth of the Wireless CommunicationsIndustry and Adversely Affect Our Business.     Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services thatutilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operatorsmust obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated inthe United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocatedto wireless communications services. Industry growth might be affected by the amount of capitalrequired to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice anddata services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers.The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions might slow the growthof the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capitalnecessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks. Our growth could be adversely affectedif this occurs.  Consolidation in the Wireless Communications Industry Could Adversely Affect OurBusiness.     The wireless communications industry has experienced consolidation of participants andsales of participants or their businesses, and these trends might continue. Any concentration orsale within the wireless industry might reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in someinstances, result in the loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations. Further, if wirelesscarriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies competitive with our technologies, wecould lose market opportunities.  Market Projections and Data Are Forward-Looking in Nature.     Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expertprojections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks anduncertainties. The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of the 3G and futuremarkets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development,pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on 3Gdevices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions.The inaccuracy of any of these projections could adversely affect our operating results andfinancial condition. In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reportsthat might be inaccurate.  We Face Substantial Competition from Companies with Greater Resources.     Competition in the wireless telecommunications industry is intense. We face competitionfrom companies developing other and similar technologies, including existing companies within-house development teams and new competitors to the market. Many current and potentialcompetitors might have advantages over us, including: (i) existing royalty-free cross-licenses tocompeting and emerging technologies; (ii) longer operating histories and presence in key markets;(iii) greater name recognition; (iv) access to larger customer bases; (v) economies of scale andcost structure advantages; and (vi) greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing,distribution, technical and other resources. In particular, our more limited resources andcapabilities might adversely affect our competitive position if the market were to move toward theprovision of an existing complete technology platform solution that larger equipment manufacturershave the ability to provide.  Our Technology and Product Development Activities Might Experience Delays.     We might experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delaysrelated to the further development of our technologies and products. Delays might have adversefinancial effects and might allow competitors with comparable technology and/or product offeringsto gain a commercial advantage over us. There can be no assurance that we will continue to haveadequate staffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful. Moreover, ourtechnologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they might notperform as expected. In addition, we might experience adverse effects due to potential delays ordenials in obtaining export licenses for the transfer of certain of our technologies, which mightbe deemed controlled technology under U.S. export control laws, to certain countries. In suchcases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected, and ourability to secure new customers and other business opportunities could be diminished.25Table of Contents  We Rely on Relationships with Third Parties to Develop and Deploy Technology Solutions.     Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on theestablishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industryparticipants. Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitatetechnology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreementsto secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into themarket portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windowsor impair our ability to remain competitive.  We Might Engage in Acquisitions or Strategic Transactions or Make Investments That CouldResult in Significant Changes or Management Disruption and Fail to Enhance Shareholder Value.     We continue to evaluate and might acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures or otherstrategic transactions and purchase equity and debt securities, including minority interests inpublicly traded and private companies and corporate bonds/notes. Most strategic investments entaila high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the date ofinvestment, if at all. Acquisitions or strategic investments might not generate financial returnsor result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies. In addition, otherinvestments might not generate financial returns or might result in losses due to marketvolatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. We could make strategicinvestments in early-stage companies, which require us to consolidate or record our share of theearnings or losses of those companies. Our share of any such losses would adversely affect ourfinancial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments.     Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in part upon our ability tointegrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration ofcompanies that have previously operated independently might result in significant challenges, andwe might be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. The difficulties ofintegrating companies include, among others:  retaining key employees;   maintenance of important relationships;   minimizing the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business matters;   coordinating geographically separate organizations;   consolidating research and development operations; and   consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.     We cannot assure you that the integration of acquired businesses with our business willresult in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the acquisition. Wemight not derive any commercial value from the acquired technology, products and intellectualproperty or from future technologies and products based on the acquired technology and/orintellectual property, and we might be subject to liabilities that are not covered by theindemnification protection we might obtain.Other Risks  The Outcome of Potential Domestic Patent Legislation, USPTO Rule Changes, International PatentRule Changes and Third Party Legal Proceedings Might Affect Our Patent Prosecution, Licensing andEnforcement Strategies.     Changes to certain U.S. and international patent laws and regulations might occur in thefuture, some or all of which might affect our patent costs, the scope of future patent coverage wesecure and remedies we might be awarded in patent litigation, and might require us to reevaluateand modify our patent prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies. In addition, the potentialeffect of rulings in legal proceedings among third parties might affect our patent prosecution,licensing, and enforcement efforts. We continue to monitor and evaluate our prosecution, licensingand enforcement strategies with regard to these developments.  The Price of Our Common Stock Could Continue to be Volatile.     Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our common stock, and suchfluctuations could continue. From January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009, our common stock has tradedas low as $13.81 per share and as high as $36.91 per share. Factors that might contribute tofluctuations in our stock price include, but are not limited to: general stock market conditions;general market conditions for the wireless communications industry; changes in recommendations ofsecurities analysts; investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-term goals;changes in market share of significant licensees; announcements concerning litigation, arbitrationand other legal proceedings inwhich we are involved; announcements concerning licensing and product matters; strategictransactions, such as spin-offs, acquisitions or divestitures; and our operating results.26Table of Contents  Approved Stock Repurchase Programs Might Not Result in a Positive Return of Capital toStockholders and Might Expose Us to Counterparty Risk.     Our approved stock repurchases might not return value to stockholders because the marketprice of the stock might decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares ofstock. Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver stockholder value over the long term, butstock price fluctuations can reduce the programs effectiveness.  Changes to Our Tax Assets or Liabilities Could Have an Adverse Effect on OurConsolidated Financial Condition or Results of Operations.     The calculation of tax assets and liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impactof uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to examinations by theInternal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, includingchallenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding.With our January 1, 2007 adoption of the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes,certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not tooccur. Although we believe we have adequately recorded tax assets and accrued for tax contingencies that meet thiscriterion, we may not fully recover our tax assets or might be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued. As ofDecember 31, 2009 and 2008, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicablecriteria to record an accrual. In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies anassessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on ourconsolidated financial condition or results of operations.  Currency Fluctuations Could Negatively Affect Future Product Sales or Royalty Revenues orIncrease the U.S. Dollar Cost of Our Activities and International Strategic Investments.     We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which might change over time asour business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financialcondition. We operate and invest globally. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates mightnegatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:  If the effective price of products sold by our customerswere to increase as a result of fluctuations in theexchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for theproducts could fall, which in turn would reduce ourroyalty revenues.   Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiariesmight be subject to the effects of currency fluctuations,which might affect our reported earnings. Our exposure toforeign currencies might increase as we expand into newmarkets.   Certain of our operating and investing costs, such asforeign patent prosecution, are based in foreigncurrencies. If these costs are not subject to foreignexchange hedging transactions, strengthening currencyvalues in selected regions could adversely affect ournear-term operating expenses, investment costs and cashflows. In addition, continued strengthening of currencyvalues in selected regions over an extended period of timecould adversely affect our future operating expenses,investment costs and cash flows.  Unauthorized Use or Disclosure of Our Confidential Information Could Adversely Affect OurBusiness.     We enter into contractual relationships governing the protection of our confidential andproprietary information with our employees, consultants and prospective and existing customers andstrategic partners. If we are unable to detect in a timely manner the unauthorized use ordisclosure of our proprietary or other confidential information or if we are unable to enforce ourrights under such agreements, the misappropriation of such information could harm our business.  If Wireless Handsets Are Perceived to Pose Health and Safety Risks, Demand for Products ofOur Licensees and Customers Could Decrease.     Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions fromwireless handsets might be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies andgenetic damage to blood, and might interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers,telemetry and delicate medical equipment. Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even ifunfounded, could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for theproducts of our licensees and customers. In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the useof wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demandfor the products of our licensees and customers"
3,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2009-03-02,">Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.     We face a variety of risks that might affect our business, financial condition, operatingresults or any combination thereof. Although many of the risks discussed below are driven byfactors that we cannot control or predict, you should carefully consider the identified risksbefore making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. In addition to the risks anduncertainties identified elsewhere in this Form 10-K as well as other information contained herein,each of the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and prospects.If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur or develop, our business, results ofoperations and financial condition could change. In such an event, the market price of our commonstock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The following discussionaddresses those risks that management believes are the most significant and that might affect ourbusiness, financial condition or operating results, although there are other risks that could ariseor might become more significant than anticipated.Risks Relating to Our Revenues and Cash FlowChallenges Relating to Our Ability to Enter into New License Agreements Could Cause OurRevenues and Cash Flow to Decline.     We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements. During discussions withunlicensed companies, significant negotiation issues arise from time to time. For example,manufacturers and sellers of 2G products could be reluctant to enter into a license agreementbecause such companies might be required to make a significant payments for unlicensed past sales.Moreover, a significant part of our TDMA patent portfolio expired in 2006. Also, certain of theinventions we believe will be employed in 3G products and other future technologies are the subjectof our patent applications where no patent has been issued yet by the relevant patent reviewingauthorities. Certain prospective licensees are unwilling to license patent rights prior to apatents issuance. Additionally, in the ordinary course of negotiations, in response to our demandthat they enter into a license agreement, manufacturers raise different defenses and argumentsincluding, but not limited to, (i) claims by third parties challenging the essential nature of ourpatents, (ii) claims that their products do not infringe our patents or that our patents areinvalid or unenforceable, (iii) certain patents should be excluded from the license, (iv) ourroyalty rates are not fair, reasonable or nondiscriminatory, and (v) the potential impact that anylitigation or arbitration in which we are involved might have on such manufacturers. We cannotassure that all prospective licensees will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patentlicense agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us.     In addition, our financial condition and operating results could continue to fluctuate because(i) a significant portion of our licensing revenues are currently dependent on sales by ourlicensees that are outside our control and that could be negatively affected by a variety offactors, including global and/or country-specific economic conditions, buying patterns of endusers, competition for our licensees products and any decline in the sale prices our licenseesreceive for their covered products; (ii) the strength of our patent portfolio could be weakenedthrough patents being declared invalid, our claims being narrowed, changes to the Standards andpatent laws and regulations and adverse court or arbitration decisions; (iii) it is difficult topredict the timing and amount of licensing revenue associated with past infringement and newlicenses, and the timing, nature or amount of revenues associated with strategic partnerships;(iv) we might not be able to enter into additional or expanded strategic partnerships, either atall or on acceptable terms; and (v) our markets are subject to increased competition from otherproducts and technologies. In addition, our operating results also could be affected by (i) generaleconomic and other conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the customers of our productsor technologies or (ii) increased expenses that could result from factors13 such as increased litigation and arbitration costs, actions designed to keep pace withtechnology and product market targets or strategic investments. Further, due to the fact that ourexpenses are relatively fixed, variations in revenue from a small number of customers could causeour operating results to vary from quarter to quarter. Our revenue and cash flow also could beaffected by (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations onthe terms or within the timeframe we expect or a decline in the financial condition of any licenseeor (ii) the failure of 2G/2.5G and 3G sales to meet market forecasts due to global economicconditions, political instability, competitive technologies or otherwise. The foregoing factors aredifficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating resultsand financial condition.Challenges Relating to Our Existing License Agreements Could Cause Our Revenue and CashFlow to Decline.      Revenue and cash flow from existing and potential licensees might be affected by challenges toour interpretation of provisions of license agreements. Such challenges or difficulties couldresult in rejection or modification of license agreements or the termination, reduction andsuspension of payments.     The licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include onlypatents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date, and, in a small number ofagreements, royalties are payable on those patents for a specified time period. As a result, thereare agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us under ourlicense agreements. In order to license these later patents, we will need to extend or modify ourlicense agreements or enter into new license agreements with the licensees. We might not be able tomodify the license agreements in the future to license any later patents or extend the date(s) toincorporate later patents without affecting the material terms and conditions of our licenseagreements with such licensees.     Some of our license agreements have fixed terms. We will need to renegotiate licenseagreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of the license agreements and, based on variousfactors, including the technology and business needs and competitive positions of our licensees, wemight not be able to renegotiate the license agreements on similar terms, or at all. In order tomaintain existing relationships with some of our licensees, we might be forced to renegotiatelicense agreements on terms that are more favorable to the licensees, which could harm our resultsof operations. If we fail to renegotiate our license agreements, we would lose existing licenseesand our business would be materially adversely affected.     Our licenses could contain provisions that would cause the licensees obligation to payroyalties to be reduced or suspended for an indefinite period, with or without the accrual of theroyalty obligation. For example, existing license agreements could be renegotiated or restructuredbased on MFL or other provisions contained in the applicable license agreement. The assertion orvalidity of any such provisions under existing agreements could affect our cash flow and/or thetiming and amount of future recurring licensing revenue.Setbacks in Defending and Enforcing Our Patent Rights Could Cause Our Revenue and Cash Flowto Decline.     Major telecommunications equipment manufacturers have challenged, and we expect will continueto challenge, the validity and infringement of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims havebeen declared invalid or substantially narrowed. We cannot assure that the validity of our patentswill be maintained or that any of the key patents will be determined to be applicable to anyparticular product. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity or scope of our key patentscould result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees and couldsubstantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements.     For example, we are engaged in a proceeding against Nokia in the USITC alleging that Nokiaengaged in an unfair trade practice by selling for importation into the United States, importinginto the United States and selling after importation into the United States certain 3G mobilehandsets and components that infringe four of InterDigitals patents. If we are delayed orunsuccessful in this matter, we might be delayed in collecting, collect less than we expect or beunable to collect royalties from Nokia on its sales of 3G products. Any significant adverse outcomein the Nokia litigation could also substantially impair our ability to renew existing licenseagreements or secure new licensing arrangements with other parties.     Royalty Rates Could Decrease for Future License Agreements.     Certain licensees and others in the wireless industry, individually and collectively, aredemanding that royalty rates for 2G and 3G patents be lower than historic royalty rates and, insome cases, that the aggregate royalty rates for 2G and 3G products be capped. A number ofcompanies have made claims as to the essential nature of their patents with respect to products forthe 3G market. Both the increasing number of patent holders of 3G and future technologies and theefforts, if successful, by certain industry members and groups to reduce and/or place caps onroyalty rates for 2G, 3G and future technologies could result in a decrease in the royalty rates wereceive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future anticipated revenue and cashflow.     Our Revenues Are Derived Primarily from a Limited Number of Patent Licensees.     We earn a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of licensees, and we expectthat a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a limited number of licenseesfor the foreseeable future. In the event one or more of these licensees fail to meet their paymentor reporting obligations under their respective license agreements, we lose any of these licenseesor our revenues from these licensees decline, our future revenue and cash flow could be materiallyadversely affected.14 It Is Difficult for Us to Verify Royalty Amounts Owed to Us Under Our Licensing Agreements,and This Might Cause Us to Lose Revenues.     The standard terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document the manufactureand sale of products that incorporate our technology and report this data to us on a quarterlybasis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of ourlicensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, flawed andpotentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our licensees. Our licensecompliance program randomly audits licensees to independently verify the accuracy of theinformation contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we willnot receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our licenseagreements, but we cannot give assurances that the random audits will be effective to that end.Risks Relating to Our ExpensesDue to the Nature of Our Business, We Could Be Involved in a Number of Litigation,Arbitration and Administrative Proceedings.     While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devicesthat use our patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek toestablish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant effort identifyingpotential users of our inventions and negotiating license agreements with companies that might bereluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a licenseto our patents in order to manufacture, sell or use products, we might commence legal oradministrative action against the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement. Inturn, we could face counterclaims that challenge the essential nature of our patents, that ourpatents are invalid,  unenforceable or not infringed or that our royalty rates are not fair, reasonable ornondiscriminatory. As a result of enforcing our IPR, we could be subject to significant legal feesand costs, including the costs and fees of opposing counsel in certain jurisdictions if we areunsuccessful. In addition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings requiresignificant key employee involvement for significant periods of time, which could divert theseemployees from other business activities.     In addition, the cost of defending our intellectual property has been and might continue to besignificant. Litigation might be required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect ourtrade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements or determine the validity andscope of proprietary rights of others. In addition, third parties could commence litigation againstus seeking to invalidate our patents or to have determined that our patents are not infringed, orare not essential or invalid or unenforceable. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietaryrights or incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to protect ourintellectual property rights could be costly and could require significant amounts of time by keymembers of executive management and other personnel that, in turn, could negatively affect ourresults of operations. Moreover, third parties could circumvent certain of our patents throughdesign changes. Any of these events could adversely affect our prospects for realizing futurerevenue.     Any Disposition of Our Modem Business Could Result in Charges or Expenditures.     Due to the rapidly changing landscape of digital baseband technology, we are evaluating anumber of options for the modem portion of our business, which could include the disposition of ourmodem business through a sale or closure. Any disposition could result in an impairment of assetsrelated to the modem business and could also result in a repositioning charge and a significantreduction to our technology solutions revenue.     We Might Face Claims by Third Parties That We Infringe Their Intellectual Property.     A number of third parties publicly have claimed that they own patents essential to variouswireless Standards. Certain of our technology solutions are designed to comply with theseStandards. If any of our technology solutions are found to infringe the intellectual propertyrights of a third party, we could be required to redesign the technology solutions, take a licensefrom the third party, pay damages to the third party or indemnify a customer or supplier for itsdamages or other losses. If we are not able to negotiate a license and/or if we cannot economicallyredesign the technology solutions, we could be prohibited from marketing the technology solutions.In this case, our prospects for realizing future revenue could be adversely affected. If we arerequired to obtain licenses and/or pay royalties to one or more patent holders, this could have anadverse effect on the commercial implementation of our wireless technology solutions. In addition,the associated costs to defend such claims could be significant and could divert the attention ofkey executive management and other personnel.Risks Related to Our Business Strategy, Markets and CompetitionThe Outcome of Potential Domestic Patent Legislation, USPTO Rule Changes, InternationalPatent Rule Changes and Third Party Legal Proceedings Might Affect Our Patent Prosecution,Licensing and Enforcement Strategies.     Changes to certain U.S. patent laws and regulations might occur in the future, some or all ofwhich might affect our patent costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure and remedies wemight be awarded in patent litigation, and might require us to reevaluate and modify our patentprosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies. As in prior years, the U.S. Congress mightconsider modification of select patent laws relating to, among other things, how patent damages arecalculated and the procedures for challenging issued patents and where patent lawsuits can be filedin the United States. Additionally, there have been recent U.S. Supreme Court and other courtrulings relating to, among other things, the standard for determining whether an invention isobvious, which is a key issue when assessing15 patentability of new inventions and validity of issued patents, the ability of a patent holderto obtain injunctive relief against infringers and the ability of patent licensees to challenge thepatents under which they are licensed. The ruling concerning injunctions might make it moredifficult, under some circumstances, for us to obtain injunctive relief against a party that hasbeen found to infringe one or more of our patents, and the ruling regarding patent challenges bylicensees could potentially make it easier for our licensees to challenge our patents even thoughthey have already agreed to take a license. In addition, the potential effect of rulings in legalproceedings among third parties might affect our licensing program. We continue to monitor andevaluate our prosecution, licensing and enforcement strategies with regard to these proposals and changes.     We Depend on Key Senior Management, Engineering and Licensing Resources.     Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our directors, executiveofficers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our abilityto continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized licensing,engineering and other skills. The market for such specialized talent in our industry is extremelycompetitive. In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise inlicensing and with significant engineering experience in cellular and air interface technologiessuch as WCDMA. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by anyadverse decisions in any litigation or arbitration and by our ability to offer competitive cash andequity compensation and work environment conditions. The failure to attract and retain such personswith relevant and appropriate experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new licenseagreements and undertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as ourability to meet our strategic objectives.We Might Engage in Acquisitions or Strategic Transactions or Make Investments That CouldResult in Significant Changes or Management Disruption and Fail to Enhance ShareholderValue.     We continue to evaluate and might acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures or otherstrategic transactions and purchase equity and debt securities, including minority interests inpublicly-traded and private companies and corporate bonds/notes. Most strategic investments entaila high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the date ofinvestment, if at all. Acquisitions or strategic investments might not generate financial returnsor result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies. In addition, otherinvestments might not generate financial returns or might result in losses due to marketvolatility, the general level of interest rates and inflation expectations. We could make strategicinvestments in early-stage companies, which require us to consolidate or record our share of theearnings or losses of those companies. Our share of any such losses would adversely affect ourfinancial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments.     Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions depends in part upon our ability tointegrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration ofcompanies that have previously operated independently might result in significant challenges, andwe might be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. The difficulties ofintegrating companies include, among others:  retaining key employees;   maintenance of important relationships;   minimizing the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business matters;   coordinating geographically separate organizations;   consolidating research and development operations; and   consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.     We cannot assure you that the integration of acquired businesses with our business will resultin the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the acquisition. We mightnot derive any commercial value from the acquired technology, products and intellectual property orfrom future technologies and products based on the acquired technology and/or intellectualproperty, and we might be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protectionwe might obtain.     Our Industry Is Subject to Rapid Technological Change, Uncertainty and Shifting MarketOpportunities.     Our market success depends, in part, on our ability to define and keep pace with changes inindustry Standards, technological developments and varying customer requirements. Changes inindustry Standards and needs could adversely affect the development of, and demand for, ourtechnology, rendering our technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. Thepatents and applications comprising our portfolio have fixed terms and, if we fail to anticipate orrespond adequately to these changes through the development or acquisition of new patentableinventions, patents or other technology, we could miss a critical market opportunity, reducing oreliminating our ability to capitalize on our patents, technology solutions or both.     Our Technologies Might Not Be Adopted By the Market or Widely Deployed.     We invest significant engineering resources in the development of advanced wireless technologyand related solutions. These investments might not be recoverable or might not result in meaningfulrevenue if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed. Competing digital wireless technologies could reduce the opportunitiesfor deployment of technologies we develop. If16 the technologies in which we invest are not adoptedin the mainstream markets or in time periods we expect, or if we are unable to secure partnersupport for our technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results could beadversely affected.The Markets for Our Technology Solutions Might Fail to Materialize in the Manner WeExpect.     We are positioning our current development projects for the evolving advanced digital wirelessmarkets. Certain of these markets might continue to develop at a slower rate or pace than we expectand might be of a smaller size than we expect. In addition, there could be fewer applications forour technology and products than we expect. The development of advanced wireless markets also couldbe affected by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipmentdevelopment, pricing of advanced wireless infrastructure and mobile devices, rate of growth intelecommunications services and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, radiofrequency licenses and infrastructure improvements. Failure of the markets for our technologiesand/or our products to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect could reduce ouropportunities for sales and licensing and could materially adversely affect our long-term business,financial condition and operating results.     Market Projections and Data are Forward-Looking in Nature.     Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expertprojections, which are forward-looking in nature and are inherently subject to risks anduncertainties. The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of the 3G and futuremarkets, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development,pricing of products, growth in wireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on 3Gdevices and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions.The inaccuracy of any of these projections could adversely affect our operating results andfinancial condition. In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reportsthat might be inaccurate.     We Face Substantial Competition from Companies with Greater Resources.     Competition in the wireless telecommunications industry is intense. We face competition fromcompanies developing other and similar technologies, including existing companies with in-housedevelopment teams and new competitors to the market. Many current and potential competitors mighthave advantages over us, including: (i) existing royalty-free cross-licenses to competing andemerging technologies; (ii) longer operating histories and presence in key markets; (iii) greatername recognition; (iv) access to larger customer bases; (v) economies of scale and cost structureadvantages; and (vi) greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technicaland other resources. In particular, our more limited resources and capabilities might adverselyaffect our competitive position if the market were to move toward the provision of an existingcomplete technology platform solution that larger equipment manufacturers have the ability toprovide.Our Technology and Product Development Activities Might Experience Delays.     We might experience technical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related tothe further development of our technologies and products. Delays might have adverse financialeffects and might allow competitors with comparable technology and/or product offerings to gain acommercial advantage over us. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequatestaffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful. Moreover, our technologieshave not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they might not perform asexpected. In addition, we might experience adverse effects due to potential delays or denials inobtaining export licenses for the transfer of certain of our technologies, which might be deemedcontrolled technology under U.S. export control laws, to certain countries. In such cases, ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected and our ability tosecure new customers and other business opportunities could be diminished.We Rely on Relationships with Third Parties to Develop and Deploy Technology Solutions.     Successful exploitation of our technology solutions is partially dependent on theestablishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and other industryparticipants. Delays or failure to enter into licensing or other relationships to facilitatetechnology development efforts or delays or failure to enter into technology licensing agreementsto secure integration of additional functionality could impair our ability to introduce into themarket portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical market windowsor impair our ability to remain competitive.Other RisksCurrency Fluctuations Could Negatively Affect Future Product Sales or Royalty Revenues orIncrease the U.S. Dollar Cost of Our Activities and International Strategic Investments.      We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which might change over time asour business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financialcondition. We operate and invest globally. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates mightnegatively affect our business due to a number of situations, including the following:17   If the effective price of products sold by our customers were toincrease as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of therelevant currencies, demand for the products could fall, which in turnwould reduce our royalty revenues.   Assets or liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries might besubject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which might affectour reported earnings. Our exposure to foreign currencies mightincrease as we expand into new markets.   Certain of our revenues, such as royalty revenues, are derived fromlicensee or customer sales that are denominated in foreign currencies.If these revenues are not subject to foreign exchange hedgingtransactions, weakening of currency values in selected regions couldadversely affect our near term revenues and cash flows. In addition,continued weakening of currency values in selected regions over anextended period of time could adversely affect our future revenues andcash flows.   Certain of our operating and investing costs, such as foreign patentprosecution, are based in foreign currencies. If these costs are notsubject to foreign exchange hedging transactions, strengtheningcurrency values in selected regions could adversely affect our nearterm operating expenses, investment costs and cash flows. In addition,continued strengthening of currency values in selected regions over anextended period of time could adversely affect our future operatingexpenses, investment costs and cash flows.   We could, in the future, engage in foreign exchange hedgingtransactions that could affect our cash flows and earnings becausethey might require the payment of structuring fees, and they mightlimit the U.S. dollar value of royalties from licensees sales thatare denominated in foreign currencies.     We Face Risks From Doing Business in Global Markets.     A significant portion of our business opportunities exist in a number of internationalmarkets. Accordingly, we could be subject to the effects of a variety of uncontrollable andchanging factors, including: difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreignjurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreigncorporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; currency controlregulations and variability in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency; social,economic and political instability; natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness andwar; potentially adverse tax consequences; and general delays in remittance of and difficultiescollecting non-U.S. payments. In addition, we also are subject to risks specific to the individualcountries in which we, our customers and our licensees do business.     Changes to Our Current Calculation of Tax Liabilities Could Have an Adverse Effect on OurConsolidated Financial Condition or Results of Operations.     The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact ofuncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to examinations by theInternal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, includingchallenges to various positions we assert in our filings and foreign tax liability and withholding.With our January 1, 2007 adoption of FIN 48, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they aredetermined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately accrued fortax contingencies that meet this criterion, we might be required to pay taxes in excess of theamounts we have accrued. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were certain tax contingenciesthat did not meet the applicable criteria to record an accrual. In the event that the IRS oranother taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment couldhave an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.     The High Amount of Capital Required to Obtain Radio Frequency Licenses, Deploy and ExpandWireless Networks and Obtain New Subscribers Could Slow the Growth of the Wireless CommunicationsIndustry and Adversely Affect Our Business.     Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services thatutilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operatorsmust obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated inthe United States and other countries throughout the world, and limited spectrum space is allocatedto wireless communications services. Industry growth might be affected by the amount of capitalrequired to obtain licenses to use new frequencies, deploy wireless networks to offer voice anddata services, expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services and obtain new subscribers.The significant cost of licenses, wireless networks and subscriber additions might slow the growthof the industry if wireless operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capitalnecessary to implement or expand advanced wireless networks. Our growth could be adversely affectedif this occurs.     Consolidation in the Wireless Communications Industry Could Adversely Affect OurBusiness.     The wireless communications industry has experienced consolidation of participants and salesof participants or their businesses, and these trends might continue. Any concentration or salewithin the wireless industry might reduce the number of licensing opportunities or, in someinstances, result in the loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations. Further, if wirelesscarriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies competitive with our technologies, wecould lose market opportunities.18      Approved Stock Repurchase Programs Might Not Result in a Positive Return of Capital toStockholders and Might Expose Us to Counterparty Risk.     Our approved stock repurchases might not return value to stockholders because the market priceof the stock might decline significantly below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock.Stock repurchase programs are intended to deliver stockholder value over the long-term, but stockprice fluctuations can reduce the programs effectiveness.     Unauthorized Use or Disclosure of Our Confidential Information Could Adversely Affect OurBusiness.     We enter into contractual relationships governing the protection of our confidential andproprietary information with our employees, consultants and prospective and existing customers andstrategic partners. If we are unable to timely detect the unauthorized use or disclosure of ourproprietary or other confidential information or if we are unable to enforce our rights under suchagreements, the misappropriation of such information could harm our business.     The Price of Our Common Stock Could Continue to be Volatile.     Historically, we have had large fluctuations in the price of our common stock, and suchfluctuations could continue. From January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008, our common stock has tradedas low as $13.81 per share and as high as $36.91 per share. Factors that might contribute tofluctuations in our stock price include, but are not limited to: general stock market conditions;general market conditions for the wireless communications industry; changes in recommendations ofsecurities analysts; investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-term goals;changes in market share of significant licensees; announcements concerning litigation, arbitrationand other legal proceedings in which we are involved; announcements concerning licensing andproduct matters; strategic transactions, such as spin-offs, acquisitions or divestitures; and ouroperating results.     If Wireless Handsets Are Perceived to Pose Health and Safety Risks, Demand for Products ofOur Licensees and Customers Could Decrease.     Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wirelesshandsets might be linked to health concerns, such as brain tumors, other malignancies and geneticdamage to blood, and might interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetryand delicate medical equipment. Growing concerns over radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded,could discourage the use of wireless handsets and cause a decrease in demand for the products ofour licensees and customers. In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wirelesshandsets while driving and the effect of any resulting legislation could reduce demand for theproducts of our licensees and customers"
12,IDCC,INTERDIGITAL INC,2008-02-29,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS.  We face a variety of risksthat may affect our business, financial condition, operating results or any combination thereof. Although many of the risks discussed below are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict, you should carefully consider the identified risksbefore making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. In addition to the risks and uncertainties identified elsewhere in this Form 10-K as well as other information contained herein, each of the following risk factors should beconsidered in evaluating our business and prospects. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur or develop, our business, results of operations and financial condition could change. In such an event, the market price of our common stockcould decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant and which may affect our business, financial condition or operating results, althoughthere are other risks that could arise, or may become more significant than anticipated. The following risk factors are not listed in any order of importance or priority.  The Price of Our Common Stock Could Continue to be Volatile.  Historically, we have had largefluctuations in the price of our common stock and such fluctuations could continue. From January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2007, our common stock has traded as low as $11.65 per share and as high as $36.91 per share. Factors that maycontribute to fluctuations in our stock price include, but are not limited to, general stock market conditions, general market conditions for the wireless communications industry, investor perceptions as to the likelihood of achievement of near-termgoals, changes in market share of significant licensees, announcements concerning litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings in which we are involved, announcements concerning licensing and product matters, or our operating results. Our Revenue and Cash Flow Could Decline Depending Upon the Success of Our Licensing Program.  Our ability to recognize revenue and generate cash flow from licensing is subject to a number of risks:  Results of Samsung and Nokia Disputes  We are engaged in (i) a dispute with Samsung over the enforcement of an Arbitral Award (Samsung Award) rendered in connection with a dispute between Samsung and ITC over the application of the MFL provision in a licenseagreement between the parties, as well as (ii) a combined proceeding against Samsung and Nokia in the USITC alleging that both Samsung and Nokia engage in unfair trade practices by selling for importation, importing into the United States, andselling after importation certain 3G handsets and components that infringe certain InterDigital patents. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in some or all of these matters, we may be delayed in collecting, collect less than we expect, or be unable tocollect royalties from Samsung on its sales of covered 2G products in accordance with the Samsung Award or otherwise, and we may be delayed in collecting, collect less than we expect, or be unable to collect royalties from Samsung or Nokia on theirsales of 2G/3G and 3G products.  Challenges to Existing License Agreements  Revenue and cash flow from existing and potential licensees may also be affected by challenges to our interpretation of provisions of license agreementsor difficulties in renegotiating current license agreements. Such challenges or difficulties could result in rejection or modification of license agreements or the termination, reduction, and suspension of payments.  Ability to Enter into New License Agreements  We face challenges in entering into new patent license agreements. During discussions with unlicensed companies, significant negotiation issues arise from time to time. For example, manufacturers and sellers of 2G products can be reluctantto enter into a license agreement because such companies might be required to make a significant lump sum payment for unlicensed past sales. Also, certain of the inventions we believe will be employed in 3G products are the subject of our patentapplications where no patent has been issued yet by the relevant patent reviewing authorities. Certain prospective licensees are unwilling to license patent rights prior to a patents issuance. Additionally, in the ordinary course ofnegotiations, in response to our demand   17 Table of Contentsthat they enter into a license agreement, manufacturers raise different defenses and arguments including, but not limited to, (i) claims by thirdparties challenging the essential nature of our patents, (ii) claims that their products do not infringe our patents or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, and (iii) the potential impact that any litigation or arbitration inwhich we are involved may have on such manufacturers. We can not be assured that all prospective licensees will be persuaded during negotiations to enter into a patent license agreement with us, either at all or on terms acceptable to us. Defending and Enforcing Patent Rights  Major telecommunications equipment manufacturers have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge the validity of our patents. In some instances, certain of our patent claims have been declared invalid orsubstantially narrowed. We cannot assure that the validity of our patents will be maintained or that any of the key patents will be determined to be applicable to any particular product. Any significant adverse finding as to the validity or scope ofour key patents could result in the loss of patent licensing revenue from existing licensees and could substantially impair our ability to secure new patent licensing arrangements.  In addition, the cost of defending our intellectual property has been and may continue to be significant. Litigation may be required to enforce ourintellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, enforce patent license and confidentiality agreements, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. In addition, third parties could commence litigation against usseeking to invalidate our patents or have determined that our patents are not infringed, invalid or unenforceable. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Any actionwe take to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and could require significant amounts of time by key members of executive management and other personnel that, in turn, could negatively affect our results of operations. Moreover,third parties could circumvent certain of our patents through design changes. Any of these events could adversely affect our prospects for realizing future revenue.  Our Future Financial Condition and Operating Results Could Fluctuate Significantly.  Ourfinancial condition and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and might fluctuate significantly in the future. Many of the factors causing such quarterly and/or annual fluctuations are not within our control. Our financialcondition and operating results could continue to fluctuate because (i) our licensing revenues are currently dependent on sales by our licensees which are outside of our control and which could be negatively impacted by a variety of factorsincluding global economic conditions, buying patterns of end users, competition for our licensees products, and any decline in the sale prices our licensees receive for their covered products; (ii) the strength of our patent portfoliocould be weakened through patents being declared invalid, our claims being narrowed, changes to the Standards and patent laws and regulations, and adverse court or arbitration decisions; (iii) it is difficult to predict the timing and amount oflicensing revenue associated with past infringement and new licenses, and the timing, nature or amount of revenues associated with strategic partnerships; (iv) we may not be able to enter into additional or expanded strategic partnerships orlicense agreements, either at all or on acceptable terms; and (v) our markets are subject to increased competition from other products and technologies. In addition, our operating results also could be affected by (i) general economic andother conditions that cause a downturn in the market for the customers of our products or technologies; or (ii) increased expenses which could result from factors such as increased litigation and arbitration costs, actions designed to keep pacewith technology and product market targets, or strategic investments. Further, due to the fact that our expenses are relatively fixed, variations in revenue from a small number of customers could cause our operating results to vary from quarter toquarter. The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and could adversely affect both our quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition.  Our revenue and cash flow also could be affected by: (i) the unwillingness of any licensee to satisfy all of their royalty obligations on the terms we expect or a decline in the financial condition of anylicensee; or (ii) the failure of 2G/2.5G and 3G sales to meet market forecasts due to global economic conditions, political instability, competitive technologies, or otherwise.   18 Table of ContentsOur Revenues Are Derived Primarily from a Small Number of Patent Licensees.  Over the past several years, a majority of our royalty revenues have been generated by a small number of licensees. For example, we recognized $253million of revenue in 2006 associated with the resolution of certain disputes with Nokia. This was 53% of our total revenue and the largest portion of our 2006 non-recurring patent license revenue of $267.4 million. Revenues from patent licenseagreements with LG, NEC and Sharp accounted for approximately 61% of our recurring revenue in both 2007 and 2006 and 52% of our total revenues in 2005. In the event NEC or Sharp fail to meet their payment or reporting obligations under theirrespective license agreements our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, many of our licensees (accounting for approximately 79% of our 2007 recurring revenues) are based in Japan, and our future level ofrevenue or cash flow from these companies could be affected by general economic conditions in Japan and each companys respective success in selling covered products in markets both inside and outside of Japan. Further, our revenues from ourpatent license agreement with LG accounted for approximately 26% of our recurring revenues in 2007. Such revenues continue only through the term of that agreement which expires in 2010, at which time most of the products licensed thereunder becomeunlicensed. If we are unable to extend the term of this agreement or enter into a new agreement with LG, our future revenue and cash flow could be materially adversely impacted.  Royalty Rates Could Decrease.  Certain licensees and others in the wireless industry, individually and collectively, are demanding that royalty rates for 2G and 3G patents be lower than historic royalty rates, and in some cases, that the aggregate royalty rates for 2Gand 3G products be capped. A number of companies have made claims as to the essential nature of their patents with respect to products for the 3G market. Additionally, for example, certain members of the European Telecommunications StandardsInstitute (ETSI) have previously sought to require all members that hold essential patents to agree upon a predetermined cumulative cap for royalties on the cost of all components of the next version of the 3GPP-based radio standard commonlyreferred to as Long-Term Evolution or LTE. Certain other members of ETSI have sought to require, for licensing purposes, consideration of maximum aggregate royalties in determining what constitutes a fair andreasonable royalty payment. Both the increasing number of patent holders of 3G and future technology and the efforts, if successful, by certain industry members and groups to reduce and/or place caps on royalty rates could result in a decreasein the royalty rates we receive for use of our patented inventions, thereby decreasing future anticipated revenue and cash flow.  Changes to Our Current Calculation of Tax Liabilities.  The calculation of tax liabilities involves significantjudgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We are subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challengesto various positions we assert in our filings. With our January 1, 2007 adoption of FIN 48, certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be more likely than not to occur. Although we believe we have adequately accruedfor tax contingencies that meet this criteria, we may be required to pay taxes in excess of the amounts we have accrued. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were certain tax contingencies that did not meet the applicable criteria to recordan accrual. In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  The Impact of Potential Domestic Patent Reform Legislation, USPTO Reforms, Imposed International Patent Rules and Third Party Legal Proceedings MayImpact Our Patent Prosecution and Licensing Strategies.  Changes to certain US patent laws and regulations may occur in the future,some or all of which may impact our patent costs, the scope of future patent coverage we secure, and damages we may be awarded in patent litigation, and may require us to re-evaluate and modify our patent prosecution, licensing and enforcementstrategies. Specifically, on Aug. 21, 2007, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued final administrative rule changes affecting the US patent application process, including among other things, the current practice regarding continuationapplications. The rule changes were set to take effect on Nov. 1, 2007; however, in the course of a lawsuit filed by Glaxo Smith Kline on Tuesday, Oct. 9, 2007, in the United Stated Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, oneday before the rules changes were to take effect, the judge in that case ruled to preliminarily enjoin the USPTO from implementing these changes.The U.S. Congress is also considering modification of select patent laws relating to, among otherthings, how patent damages are calculated and the procedures for challenging issued patents and where patent lawsuits can be filed in the US. Specifically, The Patent Reform Act of 2007 (S.1145 and H.R.1908) is currently beingconsidered for passage by the Congress. S.1145, as amended, was reported out of committee on July 19, 2007. H.R.1908, as amended, was reported out of committee on July 18, 2007, and was debated and passed by the House on September 7, 2007.Additionally, there have been recent U.S. Supreme Court and other court rulings relating to, among other things, the standard for determining whether an invention is obvious, which is a key issue when assessing patentability, the ability of a patentholder to obtain injunctive relief against infringers, and the ability of patent licensees to challenge the patents under which they are licensed. The ruling concerning injunctions may make it more difficult, under some circumstances, for us toobtain injunctive relief against a party that has been found to infringe one or more of our patents, and the ruling regarding patent challenges by licensees could potentially make it easier for our licensees to challenge our patents even though theyhave already agreed to take a license. In addition, the potential effect of rulings in legal proceedings between third parties may impact our licensing program. We continue to monitor and evaluate our prosecution and licensing strategies with regardto these proposals and changes.   19 Table of ContentsDue to the Nature of Our Business, We Could Be Involved in a Number of Litigation, Arbitration andAdministrative Proceedings.  While some companies seek licenses before they commence manufacturing and/or selling devices that useour patented inventions, most do not. Consequently, we approach companies and seek to establish license agreements for using our inventions. We expend significant effort identifying potential users of our inventions and negotiating licenseagreements with companies that may be reluctant to take licenses. However, if we believe that a third party is required to take a license to our patents in order to manufacture, sell, or use products, we might commence legal or administrative actionagainst the third party if they refuse to enter into a license agreement. As a result of enforcing our IPR, we could be subject to significant legal fees and costs, including the costs and fees of opposing counsel in certain jurisdictions if we areunsuccessful. In 2007, we spent approximately $36.9 million on patent litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings fees and related costs and accrued $24.4 million of additional costs associated with contingent liabilities. Inaddition, litigation, arbitration and administrative proceedings require significant key employee involvement for significant periods of time which could divert such employees from other business activities.  Our Technologies May Not Be Adopted By the Market or Widely Deployed.  We invest significant engineering resources in the development of advanced wireless technology and related products. These investments may not berecoverable or not result in meaningful revenue if products based on the technologies in which we invest are not widely deployed. Competing digital wireless technologies could reduce the opportunities for deployment of technologies we develop. Ifthe technologies in which we invest are not adopted in the mainstream markets or in time periods we expect, or we are unable to secure partner support for our technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adverselyaffected. For example, our ability to capitalize on our investments in WCDMA solutions depends upon market interest in such technologies. There are emerging wireless technologies, such as WiMAX, that may compete with WCDMA. If deployments of suchother competing technologies obtained significant market share, the market size for WCDMA products could be reduced. All of these competing technologies also could impair multi-vendor and operator support for WCDMA, key factors in definingopportunities in the wireless market. Similarly, changes or delays in the implementation of new wireless Standards could limit our opportunities in the wireless market.  Our Industry is Subject to Rapid Technological Change, Uncertainty, and Shifting Market Opportunities.  Our market success depends, in part, on our ability to keep pace with changes in industry Standards, technological developments, and varying customer requirements. Changes in industry Standards and needs could adversely affect thedevelopment of, and demand for, our technology, rendering our products and technology currently under development obsolete and unmarketable. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes, we could miss a critical market opportunity,reducing or eliminating our ability to capitalize on our technology, products or both.  The Markets for Our Technologies and OurProducts May Fail to Materialize in the Manner We Expect.  We are positioning our current development projects for the evolvingadvanced digital wireless markets. Certain of these markets, in particular the 3G market, may continue to develop at a slower rate or pace than we expect and may be of a smaller size than we expect. Additionally, the development projects that targetonly the emerging 3G market do not have direct bearing on the 2.5G or any other market which has developed or might develop after the 2G market, but prior to the development of the 3G market. For example, the potential exists for a reduction in thesize of the 3G market due to the success of current or future 2.5G solutions and WLAN. In addition, there could be fewer applications for our technology and products than we expect. The development of the 3G and other advanced wireless markets alsocould be impacted by general economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of 3G infrastructure and mobile devices, rate of growth in telecommunications services that would be delivered on 3G devices,and the availability of capital for, and the high cost of, radio frequency licenses and infrastructure improvements. Failure of the markets for our technologies and/or our products to materialize to the extent or at the rate we expect could reduceour opportunities for sales and licensing and could materially adversely affect our longer-term business, financial condition and operating results.  Our Technology and Product Development Activities May Experience Delays.  We may experiencetechnical, financial, resource or other difficulties or delays related to the further development of our technologies and products. Delays may have adverse financial effects and may allow competitors with comparable technology and/or productofferings to gain a commercial advantage over us. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate   20 Table of Contentsstaffing or that our development efforts will ultimately be successful. Further, if such development efforts are not successful or delays are serious,strategic relationships could suffer and strategic partners could be hampered in their marketing efforts of products containing our technologies. As a result we could experience reduced revenues or we could miss critical market opportunities.Moreover, our technologies have not been fully tested in commercial use, and it is possible that they may not perform as expected. In addition, we may experience adverse effects due to potential delays or denials in obtaining export licenses for thetransfer of certain of our technologies, which may be deemed controlled technology under U.S. export control laws, to certain countries. In such cases, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected and ourability to secure new customers and other business opportunities could be diminished.  We Face Substantial Competition from Companieswith Greater Resources.  Competition in the wireless telecommunications industry is intense. We face competition from companiesdeveloping other and similar technologies including existing companies with in-house development teams and new competitors to the market (See, -Our Technologies May Not Be Adopted By the Market or Widely Deployed). Many currentand potential competitors may have advantages over us, including: (a) existing royalty-free cross-licenses to competing and emerging technologies; (b) longer operating histories and presence in key markets; (c) greater namerecognition; (d) access to larger customer bases; and (e) greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution channels, technical and other resources. In particular, our more limited resources and capabilities may adverselyimpact our competitive position if the market were to move towards the provision of an existing complete technology platform solution which larger equipment manufacturers have the ability to provide.  We Rely on Relationships with Third Parties to Develop and Deploy Products.  The successful execution of our strategic plan is partially dependent on the establishment and success of relationships with equipment producers and otherindustry participants. With respect to FDD products for example, our product plan contemplates that these third parties will permit us to have access to product capability, markets, and additional libraries of technology. We currently have twosemiconductor partners, Infineon, in our FDD protocol stack technology development effort and NXP for a 3G solution. Delays or failure to enter into additional partnering relationships to facilitate other technology development efforts or delays orfailure to enter into technology licensing agreements to secure integration of additional functionality, could impair our ability to introduce into the market portions of our technology and resulting products, cause us to miss critical marketwindows, or remain competitive.  We Face Claims by Third Parties That We Infringe Their Intellectual Property.  A number of third parties publicly have claimed that they own patents essential to various wireless Standards. Certain of our products are designed tocomply with such Standards. If any of our products are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, we could be required to redesign such products, take a license from such third party, pay damages to the third party, orindemnify a customer or supplier for its damages or other losses. If we are not able to negotiate a license and/or if we cannot economically redesign such products, we could be prohibited from marketing such products. In such case, our prospects forrealizing future revenue could be adversely affected. If we are required to obtain licenses and/or pay royalties to one or more patent holders, this could have an adverse effect on the commercial implementation of our wireless products. In addition,the associated costs to defend such claims could be significant and could divert the attention of key executive management and other personnel.  Our License Agreements Contain Provisions that Could Impair Our Ability to Realize Licensing Revenues.  Certain ofour licenses contain provisions that could cause the licensees obligation to pay royalties to be reduced or suspended for an indefinite period, with or without the accrual of the royalty obligation. For example, some of the existing licenseagreements may be renegotiated or restructured based on MFL or other provisions contained in the applicable license agreement. The assertion or validity of such provisions under the existing agreements could affect our cash flow and/or the timingand amount of future recurring licensing revenue. We are currently engaged in two legal proceedings involving the applicability and application of Samsungs MFL provision in the Samsung Agreement  We Face Risks From Doing Business in Global Markets.  A significant portion of our business opportunities exists in a number of international markets. Accordingly, we could be subject to the effects of a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including:difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; enforcing contractual commitments in foreign jurisdictions or against foreign corporations; government regulations, tariffs and other applicable trade barriers; currencycontrol regulations; political instability; natural disasters; acts of   21 Table of Contentsterrorism and war; potentially adverse tax consequences; and general delays in remittance of and difficulties collecting non-U.S. payments. In addition, wealso are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which our customers, our licensees and we do business.  Consolidations in the Wireless Communications Industry Could Adversely Affect Our Business.  The wirelesscommunications industry has experienced consolidation of participants and sales of participants or their businesses and these trends may continue. Any concentration or sale within the wireless industry might reduce the number of licensingopportunities or, in some instances, result in the loss or elimination of existing royalty obligations. Further, if wireless carriers consolidate with companies that utilize technologies competitive with our technologies, we could lose marketopportunities.  We Depend on Key Senior Management, Engineering and Licensing Resources.  Competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in licensing and with significant engineering experience in emerging technologies such asWCDMA. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be affected by any adverse decisions in any litigation or arbitration and by our ability to offer competitive cash and equity compensation and work environment conditions. Thefailure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements and undertake additional technology and product development efforts, as well as our ability tomeet our strategic objectives.  Market Projections and Data are Forward-Looking in Nature.  Our strategy is based on our own projections and on analyst, industry observer and expert projections, which are forward-looking in nature and areinherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The validity of their and our assumptions, the timing and scope of the 3G market, economic conditions, customer buying patterns, timeliness of equipment development, pricing of 3G products, growth inwireless telecommunications services that would be delivered on 3G devices, and availability of capital for infrastructure improvements could affect these predictions. The inaccuracy of any of these projections could adversely affect our operatingresults and financial condition. In addition, market data upon which we rely is based on third party reports which may be inaccurate.  Unauthorized Use or Disclosure of Our Confidential Information Could Adversely Affect Our Business.  We enter intocontractual relationships governing the protection of our confidential and proprietary information with our employees, consultants, and prospective and existing customers and strategic partners. If we are unable to timely detect the unauthorized useor disclosure of our proprietary or other confidential information or we are unable to enforce our rights under such agreements, the misappropriation of such information could harm our business.  If Wireless Handsets Are Perceived to Pose Health and Safety Risks, Demand for Products of Our Licensees and Customers Could Decrease.  Media reports and certain studies have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to health concerns,such as brain tumors, other malignancies and genetic damage to blood, and may interfere with electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, telemetry and delicate medical equipment. If concerns over radio frequency emissions grow, this coulddiscourage the use of wireless handsets and could cause a decrease in demand for the products of our licensees and customers. In addition, concerns over safety risks posed by the use of wireless handsets while driving and the effect of any resultinglegislation could reduce demand for the products of our licensees and customers.   "
