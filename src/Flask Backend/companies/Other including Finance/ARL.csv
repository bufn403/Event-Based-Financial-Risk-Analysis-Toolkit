”.PART IITEM 1.    BUSINESSGeneralAmerican Realty Investors, Inc. (the “Company”), a Nevada Corporation, is a fully integrated externally managed real estate company. We operate high quality multifamily and  commercial properties  throughout the Southern United States. We also invest in mortgage notes receivable and in land that is either held for appreciation or development. As used herein, the terms “ARL”, “the Company”, “We”, “Our”, or “Us” refer to the Company.Corporate StructureWe own approximately 78.4% of the common stock of Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (""TCI"") and substantially all of our operations are conducted through TCI, whose common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") under the symbol “TCI”. Accordingly, we include TCI’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements. Substantially all of TCI's assets are held by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Properties Capital Ltd. (“SPC”), which was formed to raise funds by issuing non-convertible bonds that were listed and traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (""TASE""). In addition, TCI owns approximately 82.3% of the common stock of Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc. (""IOR"") a Nevada corporation, which is publicly listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol IOR.On November 19, 2018, SPC formed the Victory Abode Apartments, LLC (“VAA”) joint venture with the Macquarie Group (“Macquarie”). In connection with the formation of VAA, we sold a 50% ownership interest in 51 multifamily properties. We account for our investment in VAA under the equity method. In 2022, VAA sold 45 of its properties to a third party and distributed the remaining seven properties to us in a liquidating distribution.Controlling StockholderRealty Advisors, Inc. (“RAI”), a Nevada corporation, and its affiliates own approximately 90.8% of our common stock. As described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”, our officers and directors also serve as officers and directors of TCI. TCI has business objectives similar to ours. Our officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to both TCI and us under applicable law. In determining whether a particular investment opportunity will be allocated to TCI or to us, management considers the respective investment objectives of each company, the ability to purchase and/or finance the asset and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each company’s existing real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolio. To the extent that any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one of the entities, the investment opportunity may be allocated to the entity which has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time, or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among all or two of the entities.ManagementOur business is managed by Pillar Income Asset Management, Inc. (“Pillar”) in accordance with an Advisory Agreement and a Cash Management Agreement that are reviewed annually by our Board of Directors. Pillar is wholly-owned by RAI.3Pillar’s duties include, but are not limited to, locating, evaluating and recommending real estate-related investment opportunities. Pillar also arranges our debt and equity financing with third party lenders and investors. In addition, Pillar serves as the contractual ""Advisor"" and ""Cash Manager"" to TCI and IOR. Pillar is compensated by us under an Advisory Agreement and a Cash Management Agreement that are more fully described in Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance – The Advisor”.  We have no employees. We rely upon the employees of Pillar to render services to us in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Cash Management Agreement.In addition, as described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”, we compete with related parties of Pillar having similar investment objectives related to the acquisition, development, disposition, leasing and financing of real estate and real estate-related investments. In resolving any potential conflicts of interest which may arise, Pillar has informed us that it intends to exercise its best judgment as to what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances in accordance with applicable law.Portfolio CompositionAt December 31, 2023, our property portfolio consisted of:•Commercial properties, consisting of four office buildings with an aggregate of approximately 1,056,793 square feet;•Fourteen multifamily properties, comprising in 2,328 units; and•Approximately 1,843 acres of developed and undeveloped land.Recent ActivityFinancing Activities•On January 31, 2023, we paid off our $67.5 million of Series C bonds.•On February 28, 2023, we extended the maturity of our loan on Windmill Farms until February 28, 2024 at a revised interest rate of 7.75%.•On March 15, 2023, we entered into a $33.0 million construction loan to finance the development of Lake Wales (See ""Development Activities"") that bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus 3% and matures on March 15, 2026, with two one-year extension options.•On May 4, 2023, we paid off the remaining $14.0 million of our Series A Bonds and $28.9 million of our Series B Bonds, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million.•On August 28, 2023, we paid off our $1.2 million loan on Athens.•On November 6, 2023, we entered into a $25.4 million construction loan to finance the development of Merano (See ""Development Activities"") that bears interest at prime  plus 0.25% and matures on November 6, 2028. •On December 15, 2023, we entered into a $23.5 million construction loan to finance the development of Bandera Ridge (See ""Development Activities"") that bears interest at SOFR plus 3% and matures on December 15, 2028. •On February 8, 2024, we extended the maturity of our loan on Windmill Farms to February 28, 2026 at an interest rate of 7.50%.Development ActivitiesWe have agreements to develop two land parcels or ""PODs"" of our land holdings in Windmill Farms.  The agreements provide for the development of 125 acres of raw land into approximately 470 lands lots to used for single family homes for a total of $24.3 million. We estimate that we will complete the development of these PODs over a two-year period starting in the third quarter of 2024. During 2023, we spent $5.0 million on the project, which included $0.5 million on lot development and $4.5 million on reimbursable infrastructure investments. 4On March 15, 2023, we entered into a development agreement with Pillar to build a 240 unit multifamily property in Lake Wales, Florida (""Lake Wales"") that is expected to be completed in 2025 for a total cost of approximately $55.3 million. The cost of construction will be funded in part by a $33.0 million construction loan (See ""Financing Activities""). The development agreement provides for a $1.6 million fee that will be paid to Pillar over the construction period. In connection with the closing of the loan, we purchased the land and certain entitlement costs from a related party at an appraised value of $6.1 million. As of December 31, 2023, we have incurred a total of $16.9 million in development costs.On November 6, 2023, we entered into a development agreement with Pillar to build a 216 unit multifamily property in McKinney, Texas (""Merano"") that is expected to be completed in 2025 for a total cost of approximately $51.9 million. The cost of construction will be funded in part by a $25.4 million construction loan (See ""Financing Activities"").

As of December 31, 2023, we have incurred a total of $7.2 million in development costs.On December 15, 2023, we entered into a development agreement with Pillar to build a 216 unit multifamily property in Temple, Texas (""Bandera Ridge"") that is expected to be completed in 2025 for a total cost of approximately $49.6 million. The cost of construction will be funded in part by a $23.5 million construction loan (See ""Financing Activities""). The development agreement provides for a $1.6 million fee that will be paid to Pillar over the construction period. In connection with the closing of the loan, we purchased the land from a related party at an appraised value of $2.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, we have incurred a total of $3.1 million in development costs.Business Plan and Investment PolicyOur business strategy is to maximize long-term value for our stockholders by the acquisition, development and ownership of income-producing multifamily properties in the secondary markets of the Southern United States. We generally hold our investments in real estate for the long term. We seek to maximize the current income and the value of our real estate by maintaining high occupancy levels while charging competitive rents and controlling costs.  In the past we have opportunistically acquired commercial properties for income and appreciation.  In addition, we also opportunistically acquire land for future development. From time to time and when we believe it appropriate to do so, we sell land and income-producing properties. We also invest in mortgage receivables. Our income producing real estate is managed by external management companies. Our multifamily properties and one of our commercial properties are managed third-party companies and three of our commercial properties are managed by Regis Realty Prime, LLC (“Regis""), collectively the ""management companies"".  The management companies conduct all of the administrative functions associated with our property operations (including billing, collections, and response to tenant inquiries). Regis receives property management fees, construction management fees and leasing commissions in accordance with the terms of its property-level management agreement and is also entitled to receive real estate brokerage commissions in accordance with the terms of a non-exclusive brokerage agreement. Refer to Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance – Property Management and Real Estate Brokerage”. We also invest in notes receivables that are collateralized by investments in land and/or multifamily properties. These investments have included notes receivables from Unified Housing Foundation, Inc. (""UHF""). Due to our ongoing relationship and significant investment in the performance of the collateral secured under the notes receivable, we consider UHF to be a related party.We finance our acquisitions through operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of land and income-producing properties, and debt, which is financing primarily in the form of property-specific, first-lien mortgage loans from commercial banks and institutional lenders. Most of the mortgage notes payable on our multifamily properties are insured with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""). HUD backed mortgage notes payable generally provide for lower interest rates and longer term than conventional debt.  However, HUD insured mortgage notes payable are subject to extensive regulations over the origination and transfers of mortgage notes payable and restrictions on the amount and timing of distribution of cash flows from the underlying real estate. When we sell properties, we may carry a portion of the sales price, generally in the form of a short-term interest bearing seller-financed note receivable, secured by the property being sold. We may also from time to time enter into partnerships or joint ventures with various investors to acquire land or income-producing properties, or to sell interests in some of our properties. Historically, we have previously increased our portfolio of multifamily properties by partnering with third-party developers (“Developers”) to construct multifamily properties on our behalf. In these instances, we worked with the Developer on the location, design, construction budget and initial lease plan for a potential development project (“Development Project”). The construction costs included a development fee paid to the Developer. To ensure that the Development Project was constructed 5on plan, on time and on budget, we entered into a convertible loan arrangement with the Developer, whereby we advanced the out-of-pocket capital to the developer at nominal rate of interest with an option to convert the loan into a 100% ownership interest in the entity that holds the Development Project for a price equal to development cost.  We have also used Pillar as the Developer for our land development projects, including Windmill Farms and have elected to use Pillar as the Developer for our current portfolio multifamily development projects. We believe direct involvement through Pillar enables us to achieve higher construction quality, greater control over construction schedules and cost savings. CompetitionThe real estate business is highly competitive and we compete with numerous companies engaged in real estate activities (including certain entities described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”), some of which have greater financial resources than us. We believe that success against such competition is dependent upon the geographic location of a property, the performance of property-level managers in areas such as leasing and marketing, collection of rents and control of operating expenses, the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors include ease of access to a property, the adequacy of related facilities such as parking and other amenities, and sensitivity to market conditions in determining rent levels. With respect to multifamily properties, competition is also based upon the design and mix of the units and the ability to provide a community atmosphere for the residents. We believe that beyond general economic circumstances and trends, the degree to which properties are renovated or new properties are developed in the competing submarket are also competitive factors. Refer to Part I, Item1A. “Risk Factors
”.To the extent that we seek to sell any properties, the sales prices for the properties may be affected by competition from other real estate owners and financial institutions also attempting to sell properties in areas where our properties are located, as well as aggressive buyers attempting to dominate or penetrate a particular market.Government RegulationsOur properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas, fire and safety requirements, various environmental laws, HUD, the Americans with Disabilities Act and rent control laws.SegmentsWe operate two business segments: the acquisition, development, ownership and management of multifamily properties, and the acquisition, development, ownership and management of commercial properties; which are primarily office properties. The services for our commercial segment include primarily rental of office space and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental. The services for our multifamily segment include primarily rental of apartments and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for more information regarding our segments.Human CapitalWe have no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to us in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.Available InformationWe maintain an internet site at www.americanrealtyinvest.com. We make available through our website free of charge Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, reports filed pursuant to Section 16, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such materials to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we have posted the charters for our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance and Nominating Committee, as well as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Corporate Governance Guidelines on Director Independence and other information on the website. These charters and principles are not incorporated in this Report by reference. We will also provide a copy of these documents free of charge to stockholders upon written request. We issue Annual Reports containing audited financial statements to our common stockholders.6ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSAn investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information in this report before trading our securities.FACTORS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRYOur operating performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.Real estate investments are subject to various risks, fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. These events include, but are not limited to:•adverse changes in international, national or local economic conditions;•inability to rent space on favorable terms, including possible market pressures to offer tenants rent abatements, tenantimprovements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options;•adverse changes in financial conditions of actual or potential investors, buyers, sellers or tenants;•inability to collect rent from tenants;•competition from other real estate investors, including other real estate operating companies, publicly-traded REITs and institutional investment funds;•reduced tenant demand for office space and residential units from matters such as: (i) trends in space utilization, (ii) changes in the relative popularity of our properties, (iii) the type of space we lease, (iv) purchasing versus leasing, (v) increasing crime or homelessness in our submarkets or (vi) economic recessions;•increases in the supply of office space and residential units;•fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of credit, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;•increases in operating costs, including: (i) insurance costs, (ii) labor costs, (iii) energy prices, (iv) property taxes, and (v) costs of compliance with laws, regulations and governmental policies;•utility disruptions;•changes in, and changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and governmental policies, including, without limitation, health, safety, environmental, zoning and tax laws, governmental fiscal policies and the ADA;•difficulty in operating properties effectively;•acquiring undesirable properties; and•inability to dispose of properties at appropriate times or at favorable prices.We may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in our industry. We experience a great deal of competition in attracting tenants for the properties and in locating land to develop and properties to acquire.In our effort to lease properties, we compete for tenants with a broad spectrum of other landlords in each of the markets. These competitors include, among others, publicly-held REITs, privately-held entities, individual property owners and tenants who wish to sublease their space. Some of these competitors may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial terms than we are able to offer.Real estate investments are illiquid, and we may not be able to sell properties if and when it is appropriate to do so. Real estate generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to dispose of properties promptly in response to economic or other conditions. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to sell properties (without incurring significant tax costs) in some situations when it may be otherwise economically advantageous to do so, thereby adversely affecting returns to stockholders and adversely impacting our ability to meet our obligations.Our business may be impacted as a result of any health emergency like the pandemic impact the coronavirus.Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the recent Covid-19 pandemic, including its conclusion, the availability of and effectiveness of vaccines, the potential short-term and long term effects, including but not limited to shifts in consumer housing demand based on geography, affordability, housing type (e.g., multi-family vs. single family) and unit type (e.g., office studio vs. multi-bedroom), mainly resulting from the paradigm shift of work culture, the decentralization of corporate headquarters and the success of “work from home” models. Moreover, local, state and national measures taken to limit the spread of the 7recent pandemic have already resulted in significant economic impacts and mortality rates, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted. The extent to which our financial condition or operating results will be effected in the future by any future pandemic will largely depend on future demand and developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.We face risks associated with and have been the target of security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems.The phenomenon of cyber-attacks in general, and cyber-attacks against databases in particular, have become a risk to all companies. We are exposed to cyber-attacks, which may, depending on their success and strength, damage the privacy of the information stored in the databases as well as cause equipment failures, loss, discovery, use, corruption, destruction or appropriation of information, content and valuable technical information. In recent years, cyber-attacks against companies have increased in frequency, scope and potential damage. Malicious damage (such as the introduction of viruses and cyber-attacks) or a large-scale malfunction may adversely affect the group's business and results, including damage to the group's reputation, and the group's financial condition. FACTORS AFFECTING OUR ASSETSAdverse events concerning our existing tenants or negative market conditions affecting our existing tenants could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, release space, collect rent or renew leases, and thus could adversely affect cash flow from operations and inhibit growth. Our cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:•lack of demand for space in areas where the properties are located;•inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;•oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates;•defaults by tenants or failure to pay rent on a timely basis;•the need to periodically renovate and repair marketable space;•physical damage to properties;•economic or physical decline of the areas where properties are located; and•potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time.If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent the space. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for space that is re-let, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and debt service payments, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental income from the properties.Our reliance on third-party management companies s to operate certain of our properties may harm our business.We rely on third party property managers to manage the daily operations of our properties. These management companies are directly responsible for the day-to-day operation of our properties with limited supervision by us, and they often have potentially significant decision-making authority with respect to those properties. Thus, the success of our business may depend in large part on the ability of our third-party property managers to manage the day-to-day operations, and any adversity experienced by our property managers could adversely impact the operation and profitability of our properties.These third parties may fail to manage our properties effectively or in accordance with their agreements with us, may be negligent in their performance and may engage in criminal or fraudulent activity. If any of these events occur, we could incur losses or face liabilities from the loss or injury to our property or to persons at our properties. In addition, disputes may arise between us and these third-party managers and operators, and we may incur significant expenses to resolve those disputes or terminate the relevant agreement with these third parties and locate and engage competent and cost-effective service providers to operate and manage the relevant properties, which in turn could adversely affect us, including damage to our relationships with such franchisers or we may be in breach of our management agreement.8We may experience increased operating costs which could adversely affect our financial results and the value of our properties. Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as insurance, cleaning, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping, repairs, and maintenance of the properties. While some current tenants are obligated by their leases to reimburse us for a portion of these costs, there is no assurance that these tenants will make such payments or agree to pay these costs upon renewal or new tenants will agree to pay these costs. If operating expenses increase in our markets, we may not be able to increase rents or reimbursements in all of these markets to offset the increased expenses, without at the same time decreasing occupancy rates. If this occurs, our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness could be adversely affected.Our ability to achieve growth in operating income depends in part on its ability to develop additional properties or acquire and redevelop or renovate existing properties. We intend to continue to develop properties where warranted by market conditions. We have a number of ongoing development and land projects being readied for commencement. Additionally, general construction and development activities include the following risks:•construction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability for that property;•construction costs may exceed original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased cost of materials, labor or other costs, possibly making the property less profitable because of inability to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs;•some developments may fail to achieve expectations, possibly making them less profitable;•we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;•we may abandon development opportunities after the initial exploration, which may result in failure to recover costs already incurred. If we determine to alter or discontinue its development efforts, future costs of the investment may be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized and we may determine the investment is impaired resulting in a loss;•we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects which will not be completed; and•occupancy rates and rents at newly-completed properties may fluctuate depending on various factors including market and economic conditions, and may result in lower than projected rental rates and reduced income from operations.We face risks associated with property acquisitions. We have acquired individual properties and various portfolios of properties in the past and intend to continue to do so. Acquisition activities are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the seller’s offering price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than original estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into existing operations, and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. However, if an unknown liability was later asserted against the acquired properties, we might be required to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect cash flow.9Many of our properties are concentrated in our primary markets and we may suffer economic harm as a result of adverse conditions in those markets. Our properties are located principally in specific geographic areas in the Southern United States. Our overall performance is largely dependent on economic conditions in this region.We are leveraged and may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. We had total indebtedness at December 31, 2023 of approximately $182.7 million. Substantially all of our multifamily real estate has been pledged to secure debt. These borrowings increase the risk of loss because they represent a prior claim on assets and most require fixed payments regardless of profitability. Our leveraged position makes us vulnerable to declines in the general economy and may limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities in the future.A significant portion of our debt is insured with HUDAs of December 31, 2023, we had $128.9 million in mortgage notes payable insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""), which represented 71% of our total indebtedness. HUD insured loans allow Lenders to extend loans at a relatively low interest rate for terms of up to 40 years for properties under new construction, or up to 35 years for acquisition or refinancing of existing properties. In return for lower interest rates and favorable terms, HUD loans involve extensive regulatory compliance. While we hope to continue utilizing HUD insured loans in the future, should we not be able to access such loans, or should HUD cease to permit us to access or assume HUD insured debt, we would likely incur significantly increased interest costs and shorter term conventional loans (assuming we are able to obtain conventional loans) and possibly need to utilize funds from disposal of investments or other properties to finance such activities.An increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt. We currently have, and may incur more, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will the interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures.Unbudgeted capital expenditures or cost overruns could adversely affect business operations and cash flow. If capital expenditures for ongoing or planned development projects or renovations exceed expectations, the additional cost of these expenditures could have an adverse effect on business operations and cash flow. In addition, we might not have access to funds on a timely basis to pay for the unexpected expenditures.Properties may need to be sold from time to time for cash flow purposes. Because of the lack of liquidity of real estate investments generally, our ability to respond to changing circumstances may be limited. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In the event that we must sell assets to generate cash flow, we cannot predict whether there will be a market for those assets in the time period desired, or whether we will be able to sell the assets at a price that will allow us to fully recoup its investment. We may not be able to realize the full potential value of the assets and may incur costs related to the early extinguishment of the debt secured by such assets.10We engage in development and redevelopment activities with respect to certain of our properties. To the extent that we do so, we are subject to certain risks, including the following:•We may not complete a development or redevelopment project on schedule or within budgeted amounts (as a result of risks beyond our control, such as weather, labor conditions, permitting issues, material shortages and price increases);•We may be unable to lease the developed or redeveloped properties at budgeted rental rates or lease up the property within budgeted time frames;•We may devote time and expend funds on development or redevelopment of properties that we may not complete;•We may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, and other required entitlements, and building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, and our costs to comply with the conditions imposed by such permits and authorizations could increase;•We may encounter delays, refusals and unforeseen cost increases resulting from third-party litigation or objections; and•We may fail to obtain the financial results expected from properties we develop or redevelop;"

(""TCI"") and substantially all of our operations are conducted through TCI, whose common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") under the symbol “TCI”. Accordingly, we include TCI’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements. Substantially all of TCI's assets are held by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Properties Capital Ltd. (“SPC”), which was formed to allow us to raise funds by issuing non-convertible bonds that are listed and traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (""TASE""). In addition, TCI owns approximately 81.1% of the common stock of Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc. (""IOR"") a Nevada corporation, which is publicly listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol IOR.On November 19, 2018, SPC formed the Victory Abode Apartments, LLC (“VAA”) joint venture with the Macquarie Group (“Macquarie”). In connection with the formation of VAA, we sold a 50% ownership interest in 51 multifamily properties, (collectively referred to herein as the “VAA Portfolio”).  VAA assumed all liabilities of the VAA Portfolios.  We account for our investment in VAA under the equity method. In 2022,  VAA sold 45 of its properties to a third party and distributed the remaining seven properties to us in a liquidating distribution (See ""Recent Activity - Other Developments"").Controlling StockholderRealty Advisors, Inc. (“RAI”), a Nevada corporation, and its affiliates own approximately 90.8% of our common stock. As described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”, our officers and directors also serve as officers and directors of TCI. TCI has business objectives similar to ours. Our officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to both TCI and us under applicable law. In determining whether a particular investment opportunity will be allocated to TCI or to us, management considers the respective investment objectives of each company, the ability to purchase and/or finance the asset and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each company’s existing real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolio. To the extent that any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one of the entities, the investment opportunity may be allocated to the entity which has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time, or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among all or two of the entities.ManagementOur business is managed by Pillar Income Asset Management, Inc. (“Pillar”) in accordance with an Advisory Agreement and a Cash Management Agreement that are reviewed annually by our Board of Directors. Pillar is wholly-owned by RAI.3Pillar’s duties include, but are not limited to, locating, evaluating and recommending real estate-related investment opportunities. Pillar also arranges our debt and equity financing with third party lenders and investors. In addition, Pillar serves as the contractual Advisor and Cash Manager to TCI and IOR.  As the contractual advisor, Pillar is compensated by us under an Advisory Agreement that is more fully described in Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance – The Advisor”.  We have no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to us in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.In addition, as described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”, we compete with related parties of Pillar having similar investment objectives related to the acquisition, development, disposition, leasing and financing of real estate and real estate-related investments. In resolving any potential conflicts of interest which may arise, Pillar has informed us that it intends to exercise its best judgment as to what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances in accordance with applicable law.Portfolio CompositionAt December 31, 2022, our property portfolio consisted of:•Commercial properties, consisting of four office buildings with an aggregate of approximately 1,056,793 square feet;•Fourteen multifamily properties, comprising in 2,328 units; and•Approximately 1,858 acres of developed and undeveloped land.Recent ActivityAcquisitions and Dispositions•On January 14, 2022, we sold Toulon, a 240 unit multifamily property in Gautier, Mississippi for $26.8 million, resulting in gain on sale of $9.4 million.  We used the proceeds to pay off the $14.7 million mortgage note payable on the property and for general corporate purposes.  •On May 17, 2022, we sold Fruitland Park, a 6,722 square foot commercial building in Fruitland Park, Florida for $0.8 million, resulting in gain on sale of $0.7 million. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes. •On September 16, 2022, we sold Sugar Mill Phase III, a 72 unit multifamily property in Baton Rouge, Louisiana for $11.8 million in connection with the sale of the VAA Sale Portfolio (See ""Other Developments""), resulting in gain on sale of $1.9 million. We used the proceeds to pay off the $9.6 million mortgage note payable on the property and for general corporate purposes. •On November 1, 2022, we acquired seven multifamily properties from VAA (See ""Other Developments"") with a fair value of $219.5 million. •In 2022, we sold a total of 26.9 acres of land from our holdings in Windmill Farms for $5.1 million, resulting in gains on sale of $4.2 million. In addition, we sold 0.9 acres of land from our holdings in Mercer Crossing for $0.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $0.2 million.Financing Activities•On January 14, 2022, the $14.7 million loan on Toulon was paid off in connection with the sale of the underlying property (See ""Acquisitions and Dispositions"").•On March 3, 2022, the loan on Stanford Center was extended to February 26, 2023.•On September 1, 2022, we extended the $1.2 million loan on Athens to August 28, 2023.•On September 16, 2022, we paid off the $9.6 million loan on Sugar Mill Phase III in connection with the sale of the underlying property (See ""Acquisitions and Dispositions"").•On October 21, 2022, we paid off the $38.5 million loan on Stanford Center from the cash generated from sale of the VAA Sale Portfolio (See ""Other Developments"").•On November 1, 2022, we assumed the $70.3 million mortgage notes payable on the VAA Holdback Portfolio in connection with the distribution of the underlying properties from VAA (See ""Other Developments""). •On January 31, 2023, we paid off the $66.5 million Series C bonds.4Development ActivitiesDuring 2022, we spent $6.0 million on our ongoing development of Windmill Farms.  Our expenditures included $1.2 million on the development of land lots for sale to single family home builders and $4.8 million on reimbursable infrastructure investments.We have investment in nine notes receivable that were issued to fund the development of multifamily properties. Each of these notes are convertible, at our option, into a 100% ownership interest in the underlying property. As of December 31, 2022, one of the projects was in construction, one was in lease-up and seven were stabilized. In 2022, we advanced $2.1 million on these development notes. Other Developments:On June 17, 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell 45 properties (“VAA Sale Portfolio”) held by VAA and one property held by our SPC subsidiary.On September 15, 2022, we entered into a Distribution and Holdback Property Agreement (“Distribution Agreement”) with Macquarie, which provided the timing and ordering of the distribution of the net proceeds from the sale of the VAA Sale Portfolio, the repayment of the Mezzanine Loans, and the distribution of the remaining seven properties of VAA (“VAA Holdback Portfolio”). On September 16, 2022, VAA completed the sale of the VAA Sale Portfolio for $1.8 billion, resulting in gain on sale of $738.4 million to the joint venture. As a result, we received an initial distribution of $182.8 million from VAA, which included the payment of the remaining balance of our Earn Out Obligation to Macquarie. In connection with this transaction, we sold Sugar Mill Phase III (See ""Acquisitions and Dispositions"").On November 1, 2022, we received an additional distribution from VAA, which included the full operational control of the VAA Holdback Portfolio  and a cash payment of $204.0 million. We are in the process of negotiating the assumption of the mortgage notes payable on the VAA Holdback Portfolio.Our ownership interest in VAA is held by SPC, and is therefore our share of the proceeds from the sale of the VAA Sale Portfolio is subject to the debt covenants of the bonds issued by SPC. These provisions include restrictions on the distribution of cash from SPC. Business Plan and Investment PolicyOur business strategy is to maximize long-term value for our stockholders by the acquisition, development and ownership of income-producing multifamily properties in the secondary markets of the Southern United States. We generally hold our investments in real estate for the long term. We seek to maximize the current income and the value of our real estate by maintaining high occupancy levels while charging competitive rents and controlling costs.  In the past we have opportunistically acquired commercial properties for income and appreciation.  In addition, we also opportunistically acquire land for future development. From time to time and when we believe it appropriate to do so, we sell land and income-producing properties. We also invest in mortgage receivables. Our income producing real estate is managed by external management companies. Our multifamily properties and one of our commercial properties are managed third-party companies and three of our commercial properties are managed by Regis Realty Prime, LLC (“Regis""), collectively the ""management companies"".  The management companies conduct all of the administrative functions associated with our property operations (including billing, collections, and response to tenant inquiries). Regis receives property management fees, construction management fees and leasing commissions in accordance with the terms of its property-level management agreement and is also entitled to receive real estate brokerage commissions in accordance with the terms of a non-exclusive brokerage agreement. Refer to Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance – Property Management and Real Estate Brokerage”. We also invest in notes receivables that are collateralized by investments in land and/or multifamily properties. These investments have included notes receivables from Unified Housing Foundation, Inc. (""UHF""). Due to our ongoing relationship and significant investment in the performance of the collateral secured under the notes receivable, we consider UHF to be a related party.5We finance our acquisitions through operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of land and income-producing properties, and debt, which is financing primarily in the form of property-specific, first-lien mortgage loans from commercial banks and institutional lenders. Most of the mortgage notes payable on our multifamily properties are insured with Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""). HUD back mortgage notes payable generally provides for lower interest rates and longer term than conventional debt.  However, HUD insured mortgage notes payable are subject to extensive regulations over the origination and transfers of mortgage notes payable and restrictions on the amount and timing of distribution of cash flows from the underlying real estate. When we sell properties, we may carry a portion of the sales price, generally in the form of a short-term interest bearing seller-financed note receivable, secured by the property being sold. We may also from time to time enter into partnerships or joint ventures with various investors to acquire land or income-producing properties, or to sell interests in some of our properties. We have increased our portfolio of multifamily properties by partnering with third-party developers (“Developers”) to construct multifamily properties on our behalf. We work with the Developer on the location, design, construction budget and initial lease plan for a potential development project (“Development Project”). The construction plan includes a development fee to be paid to the Developer. To ensure that the Development Project is constructed on plan, on time and on budget, we generally enter into a convertible loan arrangement with the Developer, whereby we advance the out-of-pocket capital to the developer at nominal rate of interest with an option to convert the loan into a 100% ownership interest in the entity that holds the Development Project for a price equal to development cost.  For our land development projects, including Windmill Farms, we have acted as our own general contractor and construction manager. We believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality, greater control over construction schedules and cost savings. We actively monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship to enable sale of developed lots to third-party home builders.CompetitionThe real estate business is highly competitive and we compete with numerous companies engaged in real estate activities (including certain entities described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”), some of which have greater financial resources than us. We believe that success against such competition is dependent upon the geographic location of a property, the performance of property-level managers in areas such as leasing and marketing, collection of rents and control of operating expenses, the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors include ease of access to a property, the adequacy of related facilities such as parking and other amenities, and sensitivity to market conditions in determining rent levels. With respect to multifamily properties, competition is also based upon the design and mix of the units and the ability to provide a community atmosphere for the residents. We believe that beyond general economic circumstances and trends, the degree to which properties are renovated or new properties are developed in the competing submarket are also competitive factors. Refer to Part I, Item1A. “Risk Factors
”.To the extent that we seek to sell any properties, the sales prices for the properties may be affected by competition from other real estate owners and financial institutions also attempting to sell properties in areas where our properties are located, as well as aggressive buyers attempting to dominate or penetrate a particular market.Government RegulationsOur properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas, fire and safety requirements, various environmental laws, HUD, the Americans with Disabilities Act and rent control laws.SegmentsWe operate two business segments: the acquisition, development, ownership and management of multifamily properties, and the acquisition, development, ownership and management of commercial properties; which are primarily office properties. The services for our commercial segment include primarily rental of office space and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental. The services for our multifamily segment include primarily rental of apartments and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for more information regarding our segments.6Human CapitalWe have no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to us in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.Available InformationWe maintain an internet site at www.americanrealtyinvest.com.

In addition, we have posted the charters for our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance and Nominating Committee, as well as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Corporate Governance Guidelines on Director Independence and other information on the website. These charters and principles are not incorporated in this Report by reference. We will also provide a copy of these documents free of charge to stockholders upon written request. We issue Annual Reports containing audited financial statements to its common shareholders.ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSAn investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information in this report before trading our securities.FACTORS AFFECTING OUR ASSETSThe future outbreak of any highly infectious or contagious diseases or the reemergence of COVID – 19 and the timing and effectiveness of vaccine use or other effective medicines could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from leasing space in our residential multifamily communities to residential tenants and the ability of tenants to generate sufficient income to pay their rents in a timely manner. The market and economic challenges created by the recent COVID – 19 pandemic and measures implemented to prevent its spread have and may continue to adversely affect our returns and profitability. As a result, we could experience volatility with respect to the market value of our properties and common stock. In some cases, we may be legally required or otherwise agree to restructure tenants’ rent obligations and may not be able to do so in terms favorable to us as those currently in place. Further, various city, county and state laws restricting rent increases in times of emergency may come into effect in connection with the pandemic, and numerous state, local, federal and industry-initiated efforts have and may continue to affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent, including, among others, limitations or prohibitions on evicting tenants unwilling or unable to pay rent and prohibitions on the ability to collect unpaid rent during certain time frames. Some residents’ views about their obligations to pay rent, even when financially capable of meeting the rent obligation, have shifted away from viewing rent as a primary and necessary financial obligation, and this shift may continue or worsen as a result of the eviction moratoriums and the various laws affecting our abilities to collect rent. Additionally, market fluctuations as a result of any pandemic may affect our ability to obtain necessary funds for our operations from current lenders or new borrowings. We may be unable to obtain financing for the acquisition of investments or refinancing for existing assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. Market fluctuations and construction delays, along with increased prices, experienced by our vendors may also negatively impact their ability to provide services to us.The global impact of the recent COVID – 19 pandemic continues to evolve and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact, the timing of distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and the willingness and ability of the public to get vaccinated in a timely manner, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures, among others. Also, to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth in this Report.7Adverse events concerning our existing tenants or negative market conditions affecting our existing tenants could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, release space, collect rent or renew leases, and thus could adversely affect cash flow from operations and inhibit growth. Cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:•lack of demand for space in areas where the properties are located;•inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;•oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates;•defaults by tenants or failure to pay rent on a timely basis;•the need to periodically renovate and repair marketable space;•physical damage to properties;•economic or physical decline of the areas where properties are located; and•potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time.At any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us.If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent the space. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for space that is re-let, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and debt service payments, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental income from the properties.We may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in our industry. We experience a great deal of competition in attracting tenants for the properties and in locating land to develop and properties to acquire.In our effort to lease properties, we compete for tenants with a broad spectrum of other landlords in each of the markets. These competitors include, among others, publicly-held REITs, privately-held entities, individual property owners and tenants who wish to sublease their space. Some of these competitors may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial terms than we are able to offer.If the availability of land or high quality properties in our markets diminishes, operating results could be adversely affected.We may experience increased operating costs which could adversely affect our financial results and the value of our properties. Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as insurance, cleaning, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping, repairs, and maintenance of the properties. While some current tenants are obligated by their leases to reimburse us for a portion of these costs, there is no assurance that these tenants will make such payments or agree to pay these costs upon renewal or new tenants will agree to pay these costs. If operating expenses increase in our markets, we may not be able to increase rents or reimbursements in all of these markets to offset the increased expenses, without at the same time decreasing occupancy rates. If this occurs, our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness could be adversely affected.Our ability to achieve growth in operating income depends in part on its ability to develop additional properties or acquire and redevelop or renovate existing properties. We intend to continue to develop properties where warranted by market conditions. We have a number of ongoing development and land projects being readied for commencement.8Additionally, general construction and development activities include the following risks:•construction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability for that property;•construction costs may exceed original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased cost of materials, labor or other costs, possibly making the property less profitable because of inability to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs;•some developments may fail to achieve expectations, possibly making them less profitable;•we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;•we may abandon development opportunities after the initial exploration, which may result in failure to recover costs already incurred. If we determine to alter or discontinue its development efforts, future costs of the investment may be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized and we may determine the investment is impaired resulting in a loss;•we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects which will not be completed; and•occupancy rates and rents at newly-completed properties may fluctuate depending on various factors including market and economic conditions, and may result in lower than projected rental rates and reduced income from operations.We face risks associated with property acquisitions. We have acquired individual properties and various portfolios of properties in the past and intend to continue to do so. Acquisition activities are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the seller’s offering price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than original estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into existing operations, and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. However, if an unknown liability was later asserted against the acquired properties, we might be required to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect cash flow.Many of our properties are concentrated in our primary markets and we may suffer economic harm as a result of adverse conditions in those markets. Our properties are located principally in specific geographic areas in the southwestern, southeastern, and mid-western United States. Our overall performance is largely dependent on economic conditions in those regions.Failure by us, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are leveraged and may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. We had total indebtedness, including bonds and notes payable, at December 31, 2022 of approximately $317.2 million. Substantially all of our real estate assets have been pledged to secure debt. These borrowings increase the risk of loss because they represent a prior claim on assets and most require fixed payments regardless of profitability. Our leveraged position makes us vulnerable to declines in the general economy and may limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities in the future.9We may not be able to access financial markets to obtain capital on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms. We rely on proceeds from property dispositions and third party capital sources for a portion of our capital needs, including capital for acquisitions and development. The public debt and equity markets are also among the sources upon which we rely. There is no guarantee that we will be able to access these markets or any other source of capital. The ability to access the public debt and equity markets depends on a variety of factors, including:•general economic conditions affecting these markets;•our own financial structure and performance;•the market’s opinion of real estate companies in general; and•the market’s opinion of real estate companies that own similar properties.We may suffer adverse effects as a result of terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness.Required payments on our indebtedness generally are not reduced if the economic performance of the portfolio declines. If the economic performance declines, net income, cash flow from operations and cash available for distribution to stockholders may be reduced. If payments on debt cannot be made, we could sustain a loss or suffer judgments, or in the case of mortgages, suffer foreclosures by mortgagees. Further, some obligations contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which means that a default on one obligation may constitute a default on other obligations.We anticipate only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the maturing debt. If principal balances due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended, or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as the proceeds of sales of assets or new equity capital, cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant “balloon” payments come due.Our credit facilities and unsecured debt contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on the ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our continued ability to borrow is subject to compliance with financial and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under credit facilities, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available, or be available only on terms that are detrimental to us.Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock. The degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. The degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the general economy.An increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt. We currently have, and may incur more, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will the interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures.Unbudgeted capital expenditures or cost overruns could adversely affect business operations and cash flow. If capital expenditures for ongoing or planned development projects or renovations exceed expectations, the additional cost of these expenditures could have an adverse effect on business operations and cash flow. In addition, we might not have access to funds on a timely basis to pay for the unexpected expenditures.Construction costs are funded in large part through construction financing, which we may guarantee. Our obligation to pay interest on this financing continues until the rental project is completed, leased-up and permanent financing is obtained, or the project is sold, or the construction loan is otherwise paid. Unexpected delays in completion of one or more ongoing projects could also have a significant adverse impact on business operations and cash flow.10We may need to sell properties from time to time for cash flow purposes. Because of the lack of liquidity of real estate investments generally, our ability to respond to changing circumstances may be limited. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In the event that we must sell assets to generate cash flow, we cannot predict whether there will be a market for those assets in the time period desired, or whether we will be able to sell the assets at a price that will allow us to fully recoup its investment. We may not be able to realize the full potential value of the assets and may incur costs related to the early extinguishment of the debt secured by such assets.We intend to devote resources to the development of new projects. We plan to continue developing new projects as opportunities arise in the future. Development and construction activities entail a number of risks, including but not limited to the following:•we may abandon a project after spending time and money determining its feasibility;•construction costs may materially exceed original estimates;•the revenue from a new project may not be enough to make it profitable or generate a positive cash flow;•we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development of a property, if at all;  •we may not complete construction and lease-ups on schedule, resulting in increased development or carrying costs; and•we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, necessary governmental permits.FACTORS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRYThe overall business is subject to all of the risks associated with the real estate industry. We are subject to all risks incident to investment in real estate, many of which relate to the general lack of liquidity of real estate investments, including, but not limited to:•our real estate assets are concentrated primarily in the southwest and any deterioration in the general economic conditions of this region could have an adverse effect;•changes in interest rates may make the ability to satisfy overall debt service requirements more burdensome;•lack of availability of financing may render the purchase, sale or refinancing of a property more difficult or unattractive;•changes in real estate and zoning laws;•increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs;•federal or local regulations or rent controls;•acts of terrorism, and•hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other similar natural disasters.Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry. Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:•downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);•competition from other office, apartment and commercial buildings;•local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, apartments or other commercial space;•changes in interest rates and availability of financing;•vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;•increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;11•civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;•significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;•declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and•decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition. Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole or by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the current dislocations in the credit markets and general global economic recession. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition as a result of the following, among other potential consequences:•the financial condition of our tenants may be adversely affected which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;•significant job losses within our tenants may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;•our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;•reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; and•one or more lenders could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all.Real estate investments are illiquid, and we may not be able to sell properties if and when it is appropriate to do so. Real estate generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to dispose of properties promptly in response to economic or other conditions. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to sell properties (without incurring significant tax costs) in some situations when it may be otherwise economically advantageous to do so, thereby adversely affecting returns to stockholders and adversely impacting our ability to meet our obligations.General real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values. Real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks. If the communities and other real estate investments do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including debt service and expenditures, cash flow, and the ability to make distributions, the operating income will be adversely affected. Income from the communities may be further adversely affected by, among other things, the following factors:•changes in the general or local economic climate, including layoffs, plant closings, industry slowdowns, relocations of significant local employers, and other events negatively impacting local employment rates and wages and the local economy;•local economic conditions in which the communities are located, such as oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing;•adverse economic or market conditions due to recent COVID – 19 pandemic lead to a temporary or permanent move by tenants and/or prospective tenants from locations in which our communities are located;•the attractiveness and desirability of our communities to tenants, including, without limitation, the size and amenity offerings of our units, our technology offerings and our ability to identify and cost effectively implement new, relevant technologies and to keep up with constantly changing consumer demand for the latest innovations, including any increased requirements due to the significant increase in the number of people who continue to “work from home”;12•inflationary environments in which the cost to operate and maintain communities increases at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents or deflationary environments where we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under our short-term leases;•competition from other available housing alternatives;•changes in rent control or stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing and other increasing regulation on people and business in locations where our communities are located;•our ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance;•declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;•any decline in or tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; and•changes in interest rates and availability of financing.As leases at the communities expire, tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us. Income and real estate values may also be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988, permanent and temporary rent controls, rent stabilization laws, other laws regulating housing that may prevent us from raising rents to offset increased operating expenses, and tax laws.National and regional economic environments can negatively impact our liquidity and operating results. Our forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the southeastern and southwestern states. In the event of a recession or other negative economic effects, including as a result of the COVID – 19 pandemic, we could incur reductions in rental rates, occupancy levels, property valuations and increases in operating costs, such as advertising and turnover expenses. Any such recession or similar event may affect consumer confidence and spending and negatively impact the volume and pricing of real estate transactions, which could negatively affect our liquidity and its ability to vary its portfolio promptly in responses to changes to the economy. Further, if residents do not experience increases in their income, they may be unable or unwilling to pay rent increases, and delinquency in rent payments and rent defaults may increase as well as vacancy rates"

”.PART IITEM 1.    BUSINESSGeneralAmerican Realty Investors, Inc. (the “Company”) is a fully integrated externally managed real estate company.  We operate high quality multifamily and  properties  throughout the southern United States. We also invest in mortgage notes receivable and in land that is either held for appreciation and or development. As used herein, the terms “ARL”, “the Company”, “We”, “Our”, or “Us” refer to the Company.Corporate StructureWe own approximately 78.4% of Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (""TCI"") and substantially all of our operations are conducted through TCI, whose common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") under the symbol “TCI”. Accordingly, we include TCI’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements. Substantially all of TCI's assets are held by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Properties Capital Ltd. (“SPC”), which was formed to allow us to raise funds by issuing non-convertible bonds that are listed and traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (""TASE""). On November 19, 2018, SPC formed the Victory Abode Apartments, LLC (“VAA”) joint venture with the Macquarie Group (“Macquarie”). In connection with the formation of VAA, we sold a 50% ownership interest in 51 multifamily properties, (collectively referred to herein as the “VAA Portfolio”).  VAA assumed all liabilities of the VAA Portfolios.  We account for our investment in VAA under the equity method. On November 17, 2021, we entered into a Major Decision with Macquarie to sell all the properties held by VAA (See ""Recent Activity - Other Developments"").Controlling ShareholderRealty Advisors, Inc. (“RAI”) and its affiliates own approximately 90.8% of our common stock. As described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”, our officers and directors also serve as officers and directors of TCI. TCI has business objectives similar to ours. Our officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to both TCI and us under applicable law. In determining whether a particular investment opportunity will be allocated to TCI our to us, management considers the respective investment objectives of each company and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each company’s existing real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolio. To the extent that any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one of the entities, the investment opportunity may be allocated to the entity which has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time, or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among all three or two of the entities.ManagementOur business is managed by Pillar Income Asset Management, Inc. (“Pillar”) in accordance with an Advisory Agreement that is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors. Pillar is a wholly-owned affiliate of RAI.Pillar’s duties include, but are not limited to, locating, evaluating and recommending real estate and real estate-related investment opportunities. Pillar also arranges our debt and equity financing with third party lenders and investors.  They also serve as the contractual Advisor and Cash Manager to TCI.  As the contractual advisor, Pillar is compensated by us under an Advisory Agreement that is more fully described in Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance 3– The Advisor”.  We have no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to us in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.In addition, as described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”, we compete with related parties of Pillar having similar investment objectives related to the acquisition, development, disposition, leasing and financing of real estate and real estate-related investments. In resolving any potential conflicts of interest which may arise, Pillar has informed us that it intends to exercise its best judgment as to what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances in accordance with applicable law.Portfolio CompositionAt December 31, 2021, our property portfolio consisted of:•Five commercial properties, consisting of four office buildings and one retail property, comprising in aggregate of approximately 1,063,515 square feet;•Nine multifamily properties owned directly by us comprising in 1,492 units, excluding apartments being developed;•Approximately 1,886 acres of developed and undeveloped land; and•Fifty-two multifamily properties totaling 10,281 units owned by VAA.Recent ActivityThe following is a description of our significant real estate and financing transactions during the year ended December 31, 2021:Acquisitions and Dispositions•On March 30, 2021, we sold a 50% ownership interest in Overlook at Allensville Phase II, a 144 unit multifamily property in Sevierville, Tennessee to Macquarie for $2.6 million, resulting in gain on sale of $1.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, we each contributed our 50% ownership interests in Overlook at Allensville Phase II into VAA.•On August 26, 2021, we sold 600 Las Colinas, a 512,173 square foot office building in Irving, Texas for $74.8 million, resulting in gain on sale of $27.3 million. We used the proceeds to pay down the mortgage note payable on the property (See ""Financing Activities"") and for general corporate purposes. •During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold a total of 134.7 acres of land from our holdings in Windmill Farms for $20.2 million, in aggregate, resulting in gains on sale of $10.3 million. In addition, we sold 14.09 acres of land from our holdings in Mercer Crossing for $9.0 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $6.4 million.•On January 14, 2022, we sold Toulon, a 240 unit multifamily property property in Gautier, Mississippi, for $26.8 million. The proceeds were used to pay off the mortgage note payable on the property and for general corporate purposes.Financing Activities•On March 2, 2021, we extended our $1.2 million loan on Athens to August 28, 2022.•On March 4, 2021, we extended the maturity of our $8.4 million loan on Windmill Farms to February 28, 2023 at a reduced interest rate of 5%.•On August 25, 2021, we replaced the existing loan on Villas at Bon Secour with a new $20.0 million loan that bears interest at 3.08% and matures on September 1, 2031.•On August 26, 2021, we paid off the $35.9 million loan on 600 Las Colinas in connection with the sale of the underlying property (See ""Acquisitions and Dispositions""). •On March 3, 2022, the loan on Stanford Center was extended to February 26, 2023.4Development ActivitiesDuring 2021, we spent $15.7 million on our ongoing development of Windmill Farms.  Our expenditure included $2.8 million on the development of land lots for sale to single family home builders and $13.0 million on reimbursable infrastructure investments.We have investment in nine notes receivable that were issued to fund the development of multifamily properties  (See Item 2 - Properties). As of December 31, 2021, one of the projects was in construction, two were in lease-up and six were stabilized. In 2021, we made advanced $8.6 million on these development notes.  Each of these notes are convertible, at our option, into a 100% ownership interest in the underlying property.During 2021, we advanced $2.3 million on the development of Tower Bay Lofts, which is owned by a third party. We have an agreement that allows us to acquire this project, at our option, for the price of our investment. Other Developments:During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a loss of $29.6 million on the remeasurements of certain assets (""Earn Out Obligation"") that were sold in connection with our investment in VAA.On November 17, 2021, we entered into a Major Decision with Macquarie to engage a broker and initiate a sale of all the properties held by VAA, which are listed in Item 2. Properties as Joint Venture properties. In connection with the sale, VAA will distribute seven of its existing properties to us (referred to herein as the ""Holdback Properties"") and we in turn, will contribute one of our properties (""Contributed Property"") into the portfolio offered for sale to third-parties. The sales price for the Holdback Properties and Contributed Property will be the estimated value of these properties as stated in the agreement, multiplied by the ratio of the actual sales price of the portion of the VAA Portfolio sold to a third party to the estimated value of the those properties that were provided in the agreement. Each of the properties in the VAA Portfolio is appraised on an annual basis as part of our filing requirement with the TASE. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the VAA Portfolio, based on these appraisals was approximately  $1.4 billion. The appraised value reflect an aggregate of individual property appraised value and does not reflect a premium that is sometimes offered in a portfolio sale. These values reflects a compression of cap rates for multifamily properties during the last year. However, there can be no assurances that these values will be realized. The Major Decision agreement will expire on August 1, 2022, if the VAA Portfolio has not been sold. Our ownership interest in VAA is held by SPC, and is therefore subject to the bond covenants of the three series of bonds that have been issued by SPC. These provisions include restrictions on the distribution of cash from SPC.  (See Note 12 - Bonds Payable in our consolidated financial statements). Business Plan and Investment PolicyOur business strategy is to maximize long-term value for our stockholders by the acquisition, development and ownership of income-producing multifamily properties in the secondary markets of the Southern United States. We generally hold our investments in real estate for the long term. We seek to maximize the current income and the value of our real estate by maintaining high occupancy levels while charging competitive rents and controlling costs.  In the past we have opportunistically acquired commercial properties for income and appreciation.  In addition, we also opportunistically acquire land for future development. From time to time and when we believe it appropriate to do so, we sell land and income-producing properties. We also invest in mortgage receivables. Our income producing real estate is managed by external management companies. Our multifamily properties  and one of our commercial properties are managed by various third-party companies and four of our commercial properties are managed by Regis Realty Prime, LLC (“Regis""), collectively the ""management companies"".  The management companies conduct all of the administrative functions associated with our property operations (including billing, collections, and response to resident inquiries).  Regis receives property management fees, construction management fees and leasing commissions in accordance with the terms of its property-level management agreement and is also entitled to receive real estate brokerage commissions in accordance with the terms of a non-exclusive brokerage agreement. Refer to Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance – Property Management and Real Estate Brokerage”. We also invest in notes receivables that are collateralized by investments in land and/or multifamily properties. These investments have included notes receivables from Unified Housing Foundation, Inc. (""UHF"") Due to our ongoing relationship 5and our significant investment in the performance of the collateral secured under the notes receivable, we consider UHF to be a related party.We finance our acquisitions through operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of land and income-producing properties, and debt, which is financing primarily in the form of property-specific, first-lien mortgage loans from commercial banks and institutional lenders. Most of the mortgage notes payable on our multifamily properties are insured with Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""). HUD back mortgage notes payable generally provides for lower interest rates and longer term than conventional debt.  However, HUD insured mortgage notes payable are subject to extensive regulations over the origination and transfers of mortgage notes payable and restrictions on the amount and timing of distribution of cash flows from the underlying real estate. When we sell properties, we may carry a portion of the sales price, generally in the form of a short-term interest bearing seller-financed note receivable, secured by the property being sold. We may also from time to time enter into partnerships or joint ventures with various investors to acquire land or income-producing properties, or to sell interests in some of our properties. We have increased our portfolio of multifamily properties through ground up development. Since we don’t have a fully developed in-house development, we have traditionally partnered with third-party developers (“Developers”) to construct multifamily properties on our behalf. We work with the Developer on the location, design, construction budget and initial lease plan for a potential development project (“Development Project”). The construction plan includes a development fee to be paid to the Developer. To ensure that the Development Project is constructed on plan, on time and on budget, we generally enter into a convertible loan arrangement with the Developer, whereby we advance the out-of-pocket capital to the developer at nominal rate of interest with an option to convert the loan into a 100% ownership interest in the entity that holds the Development Project for a price equal to development cost.  For our land development projects, including Windmill Farms, we have acted as our own general contractor and construction manager. We believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality, greater control over construction schedules and cost savings. We actively monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship to enable sale of developed lots to third-party home builders.CompetitionThe real estate business is highly competitive and we compete with numerous companies engaged in real estate activities (including certain entities described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”), some of which have greater financial resources than us. We believe that success against such competition is dependent upon the geographic location of a property, the performance of property-level managers in areas such as leasing and marketing, collection of rents and control of operating expenses, the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors include ease of access to a property, the adequacy of related facilities such as parking and other amenities, and sensitivity to market conditions in determining rent levels. With respect to multifamily properties, competition is also based upon the design and mix of the units and the ability to provide a community atmosphere for the residents. We believe that beyond general economic circumstances and trends, the degree to which properties are renovated or new properties are developed in the competing submarket are also competitive factors. Refer to Part I, Item1A. “Risk Factors
”.To the extent that we seek to sell any properties, the sales prices for the properties may be affected by competition from other real estate owners and financial institutions also attempting to sell properties in areas where our properties are located, as well as aggressive buyers attempting to dominate or penetrate a particular market.Government RegulationsOur properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas, fire and safety requirements, various environmental laws, HUD, the Americans with Disabilities Act and rent control laws.SegmentsWe operate two business segments: the acquisition, development, ownership and management of multifamily properties, and the acquisition, development, ownership and management of commercial properties; which are primarily office properties. The services for our commercial segment include primarily rental of office space and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental. The services for our multifamily segment include primarily rental of apartments and other tenant 6services, including parking and storage space rental. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for more information regarding our segments.Human CapitalWe have no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to us in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.Available InformationWe maintain an internet site at www.transconrealty-invest.com. We make available through our website free of charge Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, reports filed pursuant to Section 16, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such materials to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we have posted the charters for our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance and Nominating Committee, as well as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Corporate Governance Guidelines on Director Independence and other information on the website. These charters and principles are not incorporated in this Report by reference. We will also provide a copy of these documents free of charge to stockholders upon written request. We issue Annual Reports containing audited financial statements to its common shareholders.ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSAn investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors, applicable to TCI and its subsidiaries in conjunction with the other information in this report before trading our securities.FACTORS AFFECTING OUR ASSETSThe current COVID – 19 pandemic or the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases and the timing and effectiveness of vaccine use or other effective medicines could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from leasing space in our residential multifamily communities to residential tenants and the ability of tenants to generate sufficient income to pay their rents in a timely manner. The market and economic challenges created by the COVID – 19 pandemic and measures implemented to prevent its spread have and may continue to adversely affect our returns and profitability. As a result, our ability to make distributions may be compromised, and we could experience volatility with respect to the market value of our properties and common stock. In some cases, we may be legally required or otherwise agree to restructure tenants’ rent obligations and may not be able to do so in terms favorable to us as those currently in place. Further, various city, county and state laws restricting rent increases in times of emergency may come into effect in connection with the pandemic, and numerous state, local, federal and industry-initiated efforts have and may continue to affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent, including, among others, limitations or prohibitions on evicting tenants unwilling or unable to pay rent and prohibitions on the ability to collect unpaid rent during certain time frames. Some residents’ views about their obligations to pay rent, even when financially capable of meeting the rent obligation, have shifted away from viewing rent as a primary and necessary financial obligation, and this shift may continue or worsen as a result of the eviction moratoriums and the various laws affecting our abilities to collect rent. Additionally, market fluctuations as a result of the pandemic may affect our ability to obtain necessary funds for our operations from current lenders or new borrowings. We may be unable to obtain financing for the acquisition of investments or refinancing for existing assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. Market fluctuations and construction delays, along with increased prices, experienced by our vendors may also negatively impact their ability to provide services to us.The global impact of the pandemic continues to evolve rapidly, and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact, the timing of distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and the willingness and ability of the public to get vaccinated in a timely manner, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures, among others. Also, to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth in this Report.7Adverse events concerning our existing tenants or negative market conditions affecting our existing tenants could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, release space, collect rent or renew leases, and thus could adversely affect cash flow from operations and inhibit growth. Cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:•lack of demand for space in areas where the properties are located;•inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;•oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates;•defaults by tenants or failure to pay rent on a timely basis;•the need to periodically renovate and repair marketable space;•physical damage to properties;•economic or physical decline of the areas where properties are located; and•potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time.At any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us.If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent the space. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for space that is re-let, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and debt service payments, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental income from the properties.We may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in our industry. We experience a great deal of competition in attracting tenants for the properties and in locating land to develop and properties to acquire.In our effort to lease properties, we compete for tenants with a broad spectrum of other landlords in each of the markets. These competitors include, among others, publicly-held REITs, privately-held entities, individual property owners and tenants who wish to sublease their space. Some of these competitors may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial terms than we are able to offer.If the availability of land or high quality properties in our markets diminishes, operating results could be adversely affected.We may experience increased operating costs which could adversely affect our financial results and the value of our properties. Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as insurance, cleaning, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping, repairs, and maintenance of the properties. While some current tenants are obligated by their leases to reimburse us for a portion of these costs, there is no assurance that these tenants will make such payments or agree to pay these costs upon renewal or new tenants will agree to pay these costs. If operating expenses increase in our markets, we may not be able to increase rents or reimbursements in all of these markets to offset the increased expenses, without at the same time decreasing occupancy rates. If this occurs, our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness could be adversely affected.Our ability to achieve growth in operating income depends in part on its ability to develop additional properties or acquire and redevelop or renovate existing properties. We intend to continue to develop properties where warranted by market conditions. We have a number of ongoing development and land projects being readied for commencement.Additionally, general construction and development activities include the following risks:8•construction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability for that property;•construction costs may exceed original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased cost of materials, labor or other costs, possibly making the property less profitable because of inability to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs;•some developments may fail to achieve expectations, possibly making them less profitable;•we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;•we may abandon development opportunities after the initial exploration, which may result in failure to recover costs already incurred. If we determine to alter or discontinue its development efforts, future costs of the investment may be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized and we may determine the investment is impaired resulting in a loss;•we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects which will not be completed; and•occupancy rates and rents at newly-completed properties may fluctuate depending on various factors including market and economic conditions, and may result in lower than projected rental rates and reduced income from operations.We face risks associated with property acquisitions. We have acquired individual properties and various portfolios of properties in the past and intend to continue to do so. Acquisition activities are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the seller’s offering price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than original estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into existing operations, and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. However, if an unknown liability was later asserted against the acquired properties, we might be required to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect cash flow.Many of our properties are concentrated in our primary markets and we may suffer economic harm as a result of adverse conditions in those markets. Our properties are located principally in specific geographic areas in the southwestern, southeastern, and mid-western United States. Our overall performance is largely dependent on economic conditions in those regions.Our investments in joint ventures may decrease our ability to manage risk. We conduct some of our operations through a joint venture in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partner. Our joint venture partner may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint-venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are leveraged and may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. We had total indebtedness, including bonds and notes payable, at December 31, 2021 of approximately $372.8 million. Substantially all assets have been pledged to secure debt. These borrowings increase the risk of loss because they represent a 9prior claim on assets and most require fixed payments regardless of profitability. Our leveraged position makes us vulnerable to declines in the general economy and may limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities in the future.We may not be able to access financial markets to obtain capital on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms. We rely on proceeds from property dispositions and third party capital sources for a portion of our capital needs, including capital for acquisitions and development. The public debt and equity markets are also among the sources upon which we rely. There is no guarantee that we will be able to access these markets or any other source of capital. The ability to access the public debt and equity markets depends on a variety of factors, including:•general economic conditions affecting these markets;•our own financial structure and performance;•the market’s opinion of real estate companies in general; and•the market’s opinion of real estate companies that own similar properties.We may suffer adverse effects as a result of terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness.Required payments on our indebtedness generally are not reduced if the economic performance of the portfolio declines. If the economic performance declines, net income, cash flow from operations and cash available for distribution to stockholders may be reduced. If payments on debt cannot be made, we could sustain a loss or suffer judgments, or in the case of mortgages, suffer foreclosures by mortgagees. Further, some obligations contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which means that a default on one obligation may constitute a default on other obligations.We anticipate only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the maturing debt. If principal balances due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended, or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as the proceeds of sales of assets or new equity capital, cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant “balloon” payments come due.Our credit facilities and unsecured debt contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on the ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our continued ability to borrow is subject to compliance with financial and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under credit facilities, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available, or be available only on terms that are detrimental to us.Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock. The degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. The degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the general economy.An increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt. We currently have, and may incur more, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will the interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures.Unbudgeted capital expenditures or cost overruns could adversely affect business operations and cash flow. If capital expenditures for ongoing or planned development projects or renovations exceed expectations, the additional cost of these expenditures could have an adverse effect on business operations and cash flow. In addition, we might not have access to funds on a timely basis to pay for the unexpected expenditures.10Construction costs are funded in large part through construction financing, which we may guarantee. Our obligation to pay interest on this financing continues until the rental project is completed, leased-up and permanent financing is obtained, or the project is sold, or the construction loan is otherwise paid. Unexpected delays in completion of one or more ongoing projects could also have a significant adverse impact on business operations and cash flow.We may need to sell properties from time to time for cash flow purposes. Because of the lack of liquidity of real estate investments generally, our ability to respond to changing circumstances may be limited. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In the event that we must sell assets to generate cash flow, we cannot predict whether there will be a market for those assets in the time period desired, or whether we will be able to sell the assets at a price that will allow us to fully recoup its investment. We may not be able to realize the full potential value of the assets and may incur costs related to the early extinguishment of the debt secured by such assets.We intend to devote resources to the development of new projects. We plan to continue developing new projects as opportunities arise in the future. Development and construction activities entail a number of risks, including but not limited to the following:•we may abandon a project after spending time and money determining its feasibility;•construction costs may materially exceed original estimates;•the revenue from a new project may not be enough to make it profitable or generate a positive cash flow;•we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development of a property, if at all;  •we may not complete construction and lease-ups on schedule, resulting in increased development or carrying costs; and•we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, necessary governmental permits.FACTORS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRYThe overall business is subject to all of the risks associated with the real estate industry. We are subject to all risks incident to investment in real estate, many of which relate to the general lack of liquidity of real estate investments, including, but not limited to:•our real estate assets are concentrated primarily in the southwest and any deterioration in the general economic conditions of this region could have an adverse effect;•changes in interest rates may make the ability to satisfy overall debt service requirements more burdensome;•lack of availability of financing may render the purchase, sale or refinancing of a property more difficult or unattractive;•changes in real estate and zoning laws;•increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs;•federal or local regulations or rent controls;•acts of terrorism, and•hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other similar natural disasters.Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry. Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:•downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);•competition from other office, apartment and commercial buildings;•local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, apartments or other commercial space;•changes in interest rates and availability of financing;11•vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;•increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;•civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;•significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;•declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and•decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition. Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole or by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the current dislocations in the credit markets and general global economic recession. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition as a result of the following, among other potential consequences:•the financial condition of our tenants may be adversely affected which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;•significant job losses within our tenants may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;•our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;•reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; and•one or more lenders could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all.Real estate investments are illiquid, and we may not be able to sell properties if and when it is appropriate to do so. Real estate generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to dispose of properties promptly in response to economic or other conditions. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to sell properties (without incurring significant tax costs) in some situations when it may be otherwise economically advantageous to do so, thereby adversely affecting returns to stockholders and adversely impacting our ability to meet our obligations.General real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values. Real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks. If the communities and other real estate investments do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including debt service and Expenditures, cash flow, and the ability to make distributions, the operating income will be adversely affected. Income from the communities may be further adversely affected by, among other things, the following factors:•changes in the general or local economic climate, including layoffs, plant closings, industry slowdowns, relocations of significant local employers, and other events negatively impacting local employment rates and wages and the local economy;•local economic conditions in which the communities are located, such as oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing;•adverse economic or market conditions due to COVID – 19 pandemic leading to a temporary or permanent move by tenants and/or prospective tenants from locations in which our communities are located;12•the attractiveness and desirability of our communities to tenants, including, without limitation, the size and amenity offerings of our units, our technology offerings and our ability to identify and cost effectively implement new, relevant technologies and to keep up with constantly changing consumer demand for the latest innovations, including any increased requirements due to the significant increase in the number of people who continue to “work from home”;•inflationary environments in which the cost to operate and maintain communities increases at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents or deflationary environments where we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under our short-term leases;•competition from other available housing alternatives;•changes in rent control or stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing and other increasing regulation on people and business in locations where our communities are located;•our ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance;•declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;•any decline in or tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; and•changes in interest rates and availability of financing.As leases at the communities expire, tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us. Income and real estate values may also be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988, permanent and temporary rent controls, rent stabilization laws, other laws regulating housing that may prevent us from raising rents to offset increased operating expenses, and tax laws.National and regional economic environments can negatively impact our liquidity and operating results. Our forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the southeastern and southwestern states. In the event of a recession or other negative economic effects, including as a result of the COVID – 19 pandemic, we could incur reductions in rental rates, occupancy levels, property valuations and increases in operating costs, such as advertising and turnover expenses. Any such recession or similar event may affect consumer confidence and spending and negatively impact the volume and pricing of real estate transactions, which could negatively affect our liquidity and its ability to vary its portfolio promptly in responses to changes to the economy. Further, if residents do not experience increases in their income, they may be unable or unwilling to pay rent increases, and delinquency in rent payments and rent defaults may increase as well as vacancy rates"

”.PART IITEM 1.    BUSINESSGeneralAmerican Realty Investors, Inc. (the “Company”) is a fully integrated externally managed real estate company.  We operate high quality multifamily and  properties  throughout the southern United States. We also invest in mortgage notes receivable and in land that is either held for appreciation and or development. As used herein, the terms “ARL”, “the Company”, “We”, “Our”, or “Us” refer to the Company.Corporate StructureWe own approximately 78.4% of Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (""TCI"") and substantially all of our operations are conducted through TCI, whose common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “TCI”. Accordingly, we include TCI’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements. Substantially all of TCI's assets are held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Properties Capital Ltd (“SPC”), which was formed to allow us to raise funds by issuing non-convertible bonds that are listed and traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange. On November 19, 2018, we formed the Victory Abode Apartments, LLC (“VAA”) joint venture with the Macquarie Group (“Macquarie”). In connection with the formation of VAA, we sold a 50% ownership interest in 52 multifamily properties, (collectively referred to herein as the “VAA Portfolio”).  VAA assumed all liabilities of the VAA Portfolios.  We account for our investment in VAA under the equity method.Controlling ShareholderRealty Advisors, Inc. (“RAI”) and its affiliates own in approximately 90.8% of our common stock. As described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”, our officers and directors also serve as officers and directors of TCI. TCI has business objectives similar to ours. Our officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to both TCI and us under applicable law. In determining whether a particular investment opportunity will be allocated to TCI our to us, management considers the respective investment objectives of each company and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each company’s existing real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolio. To the extent that any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one of the entities, the investment opportunity may be allocated to the entity which has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time, or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among all three or two of the entities.ManagementOur business is managed by Pillar Income Asset Management, Inc. (“Pillar”) in accordance with an Advisory Agreement that is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors. Pillar is a wholly-owned affiliate of RAI.Pillar’s duties include, but are not limited to, locating, evaluating and recommending real estate and real estate-related investment opportunities. Pillar also arranges our debt and equity financing with third party lenders and investors.  They also serve as the contractual Advisor and Cash Manager to TCI.  As the contractual advisor, Pillar is compensated by us under an Advisory Agreement that is more fully described in Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance – The Advisor”.  We have no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to us in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.3In addition, as described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”, we compete with related parties of Pillar having similar investment objectives related to the acquisition, development, disposition, leasing and financing of real estate and real estate-related investments. In resolving any potential conflicts of interest which may arise, Pillar has informed us that it intends to exercise its best judgment as to what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances in accordance with applicable law.Portfolio CompositionAt December 31, 2020, our portfolio of income-producing properties consisted of:•Six commercial properties consisting of five office buildings and 1 retail property comprising in aggregate of approximately 1,575,685 square feet;•Ten multifamily properties owned directly by us comprising in 1,636 units, excluding apartments being developed;•Approximately 1,961 acres of developed and undeveloped land; and•Fifty-one multifamily properties totaling 9,888 units owned by VAA.Recent ActivityThe following is a description of the Company’s significant real estate and financing transactions during the year ended December 31, 2020:Acquisitions and Dispositions•On March 5, 2020, we acquired a 49.2 acres land parcel in Kent, Ohio for $5.4 million that was funded by a $2.0 million cash payment and a $3.4 million note payable that bears interest at 10% and matures on November 13, 2024.•On May 1, 2020, we sold Villager, a 33 unit multifamily property in Fort Walton, Florida for $2.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $1.0 million.•On July 16, 2020, we sold Farnham Park, a 144 unit multifamily property in Port Arthur, Texas for $13.3 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $2.7 million.•On September 14, 2020, we sold Bridge View Plaza, a 122,205 square foot retail property in La Crosse, Wisconsin for $5.3 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $4.6 million.•During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold a total of 58.8 acres of land from our holdings in Windmill Farms for a total of $12.9 million, resulting in a total gain on sale of $11.1 million. In addition, we sold a total of 26.8 acres of land from our holdings in Mercer Crossing during the year ended December 31, 2020 for a total of $15.8 million, resulting in a total gain on sale of $10.3 million.Financing Activities•On November 30, 2020, we issued $19.7 million in additional Series A bonds (See Note 11 in our consolidated financial statements) for $18.8 million in net proceeds.  •On December 3, 2020, we extended our $14.7 million HSW Partners loan to June 17, 2021.•On March 2, 2021, we extended our $1.2 million loan on Athens to August 28, 2022.•On March 4, 2021, we received a commitment from our lender to extend the maturity of our $10.4 million loan on Windmill Farms until February 28, 2023 and a the reduced interest rate of 5%.4Development ActivitiesDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the construction of Parc at Denham Springs Phase II and Sugar Mill Phase III for a total cost of $17.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively.

We generally hold our investments in real estate for the long term. We seek to maximize the current income and the value of our real estate by maintaining high occupancy levels while charging competitive rents and controlling costs.  In the past we have opportunistically acquired commercial properties for income and appreciation.  In addition, we also opportunistically acquire land for future development. From time to time and when we believe it appropriate to do so, we sell land and income-producing properties. We also invest in mortgage receivables. Our income producing real estate is managed by external management companies. Our multifamily properties are managed by various third-party companies and our commercial properties are managed by Regis Realty Prime, LLC, dba Regis Property Management, LLC (“Regis""), collectively the ""management companies"".  The management companies conduct all of the administrative functions associated with our property operations (including billing, collections, and response to resident inquiries).  Regis receives property management fees, construction management fees and leasing commissions in accordance with the terms of its property-level management agreement and is also entitled to receive real estate brokerage commissions in accordance with the terms of a non-exclusive brokerage agreement. Refer to Part III, Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance – Property Management and Real Estate Brokerage”. We also invest in notes receivables that are collateralized by investments in land and/or multifamily properties. These investments have included notes receivables from Unified Housing Foundation, Inc. (""UHF"") Due to our ongoing relationship and the significant investment in the performance of the collateral secured under the notes receivable, we consider UHF to be a related party.We finance our acquisitions through operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of land and income-producing properties, and debt financing primarily in the form of property-specific, first-lien mortgage loans from commercial banks and institutional lenders. Most of the mortgage notes payable on our multifamily properties are insured with Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""). HUD back mortgage notes payable generally provides for lower interest rates and longer term than conventional debt.  However, HUD insured mortgage notes payable are subject to extensive regulations over the origination and transfers of mortgage notes payable and restrictions on the amount and timing of distribution of cash flows from the underlying real estate. When we sell properties, we may carry a portion of the sales price, generally in the form of a short-term interest bearing seller-financed note receivable, secured by the property being sold. We may also from time to time enter into partnerships or joint ventures with various investors to acquire land or income-producing properties, or to sell interests in some of our properties. We have increased our portfolio of multifamily properties through ground up development. Since we don’t have a fully developed in-house development, we have traditionally partnered with third-party developers (“Developers”) to construct multifamily properties on our behalf. We work with the Developer on the location, design, construction budget and initial lease plan for a potential development project (“Development Project”). The construction plan includes a development fee to be paid to the Developer. To ensure that the Development Project is constructed on plan, on time and on budget, we generally enter into a convertible loan arrangement with the Developer, whereby we advance the out-of-pocket capital to the developer at nominal 5rate of interest with an option to convert the loan into a 100% ownership interest in the entity that holds the Development Project for a price equal to development cost.  For our land development projects, including Windmill Farms, we have acted as our own general contractor and construction manager. We believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality, greater control over construction schedules and cost savings. We actively monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship to enable sale of developed lots to third-party home builders.CompetitionThe real estate business is highly competitive and we compete with numerous companies engaged in real estate activities (including certain entities described in Part III, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”), some of which have greater financial resources than us. We believe that success against such competition is dependent upon the geographic location of a property, the performance of property-level managers in areas such as leasing and marketing, collection of rents and control of operating expenses, the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors include ease of access to a property, the adequacy of related facilities such as parking and other amenities, and sensitivity to market conditions in determining rent levels. With respect to multifamily properties, competition is also based upon the design and mix of the units and the ability to provide a community atmosphere for the residents. We believe that beyond general economic circumstances and trends, the degree to which properties are renovated or new properties are developed in the competing submarket are also competitive factors. Refer to Part I, Item1A. “Risk Factors
”.To the extent that we seek to sell any properties, the sales prices for the properties may be affected by competition from other real estate owners and financial institutions also attempting to sell properties in areas where our properties are located, as well as aggressive buyers attempting to dominate or penetrate a particular market.Government RegulationsOur properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas, fire and safety requirements, various environmental laws, HUD, the ADA and rent control laws.SegmentsWe operate two business segments: the acquisition, development, ownership and management of multifamily properties, and the acquisition, development, ownership and management of commercial properties; which are primarily office properties. The services for our office segment include primarily rental of office space and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental. The services for our multifamily segment include primarily rental of apartments and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for more information regarding our segments.Human CapitalWe have no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to us in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.Available InformationWe maintain an internet site at www.transconrealty-invest.com. We make available through our website free of charge Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, reports filed pursuant to Section 16, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such materials to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we have posted the charters for our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance and Nominating Committee, as well as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Corporate Governance Guidelines on Director Independence and other information on the website. These charters and principles are not incorporated in this Report by reference. We will also provide a copy of these documents free of charge to stockholders upon written request. The Company issues Annual Reports containing audited financial statements to its common shareholders.6ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSAn investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors, applicable to TCI and its subsidiaries in conjunction with the other information in this report before trading our securities.FACTORS AFFECTING OUR ASSETSThe current COVID – 19 pandemic or the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases and the timing and effectiveness of vaccine distribution or other effective medicines could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The outbreak of COVID – 19, which is present in nearly all regions of the world, including the United States and the specific regions in which our residential apartment communities are located, has created considerable instability and disruption in the U. S. and world economies. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds COVID – 19, including when the pandemic will conclude, how quickly vaccines will be safely and widely distributed, the effectiveness of such vaccines, the potential short-term and long-term effects, including but not limited to shifts in consumer housing demand based on geography, affordability, housing type (e.g., multifamily versus single family), and unit type (e.g., studio in the office versus multi-bedroom), mainly resulting from the paradigm shift of work culture, the decentralization of corporate headquarters and the success of “work from home” models. Moreover, local, state and national measures taken to limit the spread of COVID – 19, including “social distancing” and other restrictions on travel, congregation and business operations, have already resulted in significant negative economic impacts. The prolonged impact of COVID – 19 on the U. S. and world economies remains uncertain but has resulted in increased health issues and mortality rates, increased unemployment, and a worldwide economic downturn, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted. The extent to which our financial condition or operating results will continue to be affected by the COVID – 19 pandemic will largely depend on future demand and developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.Our operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from leasing space in our residential multifamily communities to residential tenants and the ability of tenants to generate sufficient income to pay their rents in a timely manner. The market and economic challenges created by the COVID – 19 pandemic and measures implemented to prevent its spread have and may continue to adversely affect our returns and profitability. As a result, our ability to make distributions may be compromised, and we could experience volatility with respect to the market value of our properties and common stock. The spread of COVID – 19 has resulted in increases in unemployment and mass layoffs, and some tenants have experienced deteriorating financial conditions and are unwilling or unable to pay all or part of their rent on a timely basis, or at all, and the continued spread of COVID – 19 as well as a sustained economic downturn may result in further increases or sustainment of these situations. In some cases, we may be legally required or otherwise agree to restructure tenants’ rent obligations and may not be able to do so in terms favorable to us as those currently in place. Further, various city, county and state laws restricting rent increases in times of emergency may come into effect in connection with the COVID – 19 pandemic, and numerous state, local, federal and industry-initiated efforts have and may continue to affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent, including, among others, limitations or prohibitions on evicting tenants unwilling or unable to pay rent and prohibitions on the ability to collect unpaid rent during certain time frames. Additionally, eviction moratoriums have passed at various formats at every level of government, and while we strive to comply, given some of the conflicting standards and unclear requirements, strict compliance may be difficult. Some residents’ views about their obligations to pay rent, even when financially capable of meeting the rent obligation, have shifted away from viewing rent as a primary and necessary financial obligation, and this shift may continue or worsen as a result of the eviction moratoriums and the various laws affecting our abilities to collect rent. In the event of tenant nonpayment, default or bankruptcy, we may incur costs in protecting our investment and re-leasing our property and have limited ability to renew existing leases or sign new leases at projected rents. Additionally, market fluctuations as a result of the COVID – 19 pandemic may affect our ability to obtain necessary funds for our operations from current lenders or new borrowings. We may be unable to obtain financing for the acquisition of investments or refinancing for existing assets on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, moratoriums on construction and macroeconomic factors have caused some construction delays and may cause construction contractors to be unable to perform and governmental inspections and approvals to be delayed or postponed, which may cause a delivery date of certain development projects or investments in third-party development projects to be materially extended. Market fluctuations and construction delays experienced by our vendors may also negatively impact their ability to provide services to us. Further, while we carry general liability, pollution and property insurance, along with other insurance policies, and may provide some coverage for any losses or costs incurred in connection with the COVID – 19 pandemic, given the novelty of the issue and scale of losses incurred throughout the world, there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover all or any portion of our losses and costs under these policies.7The global impact of the COVID – 19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly, and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact, the timing of distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and the willingness and ability of the public to get vaccinated in a timely manner, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures, among others. Also, to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth in this Report.Adverse events concerning our existing tenants or negative market conditions affecting our existing tenants could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, release space, collect rent or renew leases, and thus could adversely affect cash flow from operations and inhibit growth. Cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:•lack of demand for space in areas where the properties are located;•inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;•oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates;•defaults by tenants or failure to pay rent on a timely basis;•the need to periodically renovate and repair marketable space;•physical damage to properties;•economic or physical decline of the areas where properties are located; and•potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time.At any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us.If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent the space. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for space that is re-let, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and debt service payments, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental income from the properties.We may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in our industry. We experience a great deal of competition in attracting tenants for the properties and in locating land to develop and properties to acquire.In our effort to lease properties, we compete for tenants with a broad spectrum of other landlords in each of the markets. These competitors include, among others, publicly-held REITs, privately-held entities, individual property owners and tenants who wish to sublease their space. Some of these competitors may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial terms than we are able to offer.If the availability of land or high quality properties in our markets diminishes, operating results could be adversely affected.We may experience increased operating costs which could adversely affect our financial results and the value of our properties. Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as insurance, cleaning, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping, repairs, and maintenance of the properties. While some current tenants are obligated by their leases to reimburse us for a portion of these costs, there is no assurance that these tenants will make such payments or agree to pay these costs upon renewal or new tenants will agree to pay these costs. If operating expenses increase in our markets, we may not be able to increase rents or reimbursements in all of these markets to offset the increased expenses, without at the same time decreasing occupancy rates. If this occurs, our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness could be adversely affected.8Our ability to achieve growth in operating income depends in part on its ability to develop additional properties or acquire and redevelop or renovate existing properties. We intend to continue to develop properties where warranted by market conditions. We have a number of ongoing development and land projects being readied for commencement.Additionally, general construction and development activities include the following risks:•construction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability for that property;•construction costs may exceed original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased cost of materials, labor or other costs, possibly making the property less profitable because of inability to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs;•some developments may fail to achieve expectations, possibly making them less profitable;•we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;•we may abandon development opportunities after the initial exploration, which may result in failure to recover costs already incurred. If we determine to alter or discontinue its development efforts, future costs of the investment may be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized and we may determine the investment is impaired resulting in a loss;•we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects which will not be completed; and•occupancy rates and rents at newly-completed properties may fluctuate depending on various factors including market and economic conditions, and may result in lower than projected rental rates and reduced income from operations.We face risks associated with property acquisitions. We acquire individual properties and various portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so. Acquisition activities are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the seller’s offering price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than original estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into existing operations, and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. However, if an unknown liability was later asserted against the acquired properties, we might be required to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect cash flow.Many of our properties are concentrated in our primary markets and we may suffer economic harm as a result of adverse conditions in those markets. Our properties are located principally in specific geographic areas in the southwestern, southeastern, and mid-western United States. Our overall performance is largely dependent on economic conditions in those regions.Our investments in joint ventures may decrease our ability to manage risk. We conduct some of our operations through a joint venture in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partner. Our joint venture partner may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint-venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or 9results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are leveraged and may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. We had total indebtedness, including bonds and notes payable, at December 31, 2020 of approximately $480.6 million. Substantially all assets have been pledged to secure debt. These borrowings increase the risk of loss because they represent a prior claim on assets and most require fixed payments regardless of profitability. Our leveraged position makes us vulnerable to declines in the general economy and may limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities in the future.We may not be able to access financial markets to obtain capital on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms. We rely on proceeds from property dispositions and third party capital sources for a portion of our capital needs, including capital for acquisitions and development. The public debt and equity markets are also among the sources upon which we rely. There is no guarantee that we will be able to access these markets or any other source of capital. The ability to access the public debt and equity markets depends on a variety of factors, including:•general economic conditions affecting these markets;•our own financial structure and performance;•the market’s opinion of real estate companies in general; and•the market’s opinion of real estate companies that own similar properties.We may suffer adverse effects as a result of terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness.Required payments on our indebtedness generally are not reduced if the economic performance of the portfolio declines. If the economic performance declines, net income, cash flow from operations and cash available for distribution to stockholders may be reduced. If payments on debt cannot be made, we could sustain a loss or suffer judgments, or in the case of mortgages, suffer foreclosures by mortgagees. Further, some obligations contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which means that a default on one obligation may constitute a default on other obligations.We anticipate only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the maturing debt. If principal balances due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended, or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as the proceeds of sales of assets or new equity capital, cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant “balloon” payments come due.Our credit facilities and unsecured debt contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on the ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our continued ability to borrow is subject to compliance with financial and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under credit facilities, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available, or be available only on terms that are detrimental to us.Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock. The degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. The degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the general economy.An increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt. We currently have, and may incur more, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will the interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures.10Unbudgeted capital expenditures or cost overruns could adversely affect business operations and cash flow. If capital expenditures for ongoing or planned development projects or renovations exceed expectations, the additional cost of these expenditures could have an adverse effect on business operations and cash flow. In addition, we might not have access to funds on a timely basis to pay for the unexpected expenditures.Construction costs are funded in large part through construction financing, which we may guarantee. Our obligation to pay interest on this financing continues until the rental project is completed, leased-up and permanent financing is obtained, or the project is sold, or the construction loan is otherwise paid. Unexpected delays in completion of one or more ongoing projects could also have a significant adverse impact on business operations and cash flow.We may need to sell properties from time to time for cash flow purposes. Because of the lack of liquidity of real estate investments generally, our ability to respond to changing circumstances may be limited. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In the event that we must sell assets to generate cash flow, we cannot predict whether there will be a market for those assets in the time period desired, or whether we will be able to sell the assets at a price that will allow us to fully recoup its investment. We may not be able to realize the full potential value of the assets and may incur costs related to the early extinguishment of the debt secured by such assets.We intend to devote resources to the development of new projects. We plan to continue developing new projects as opportunities arise in the future. Development and construction activities entail a number of risks, including but not limited to the following:•we may abandon a project after spending time and money determining its feasibility;•construction costs may materially exceed original estimates;•the revenue from a new project may not be enough to make it profitable or generate a positive cash flow;•we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development of a property, if at all;  •we may not complete construction and lease-ups on schedule, resulting in increased development or carrying costs; and•we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, necessary governmental permits.FACTORS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRYThe overall business is subject to all of the risks associated with the real estate industry. We are subject to all risks incident to investment in real estate, many of which relate to the general lack of liquidity of real estate investments, including, but not limited to:•our real estate assets are concentrated primarily in the southwest and any deterioration in the general economic conditions of this region could have an adverse effect;•changes in interest rates may make the ability to satisfy overall debt service requirements more burdensome;•lack of availability of financing may render the purchase, sale or refinancing of a property more difficult or unattractive;•changes in real estate and zoning laws;•increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs;•federal or local regulations or rent controls;•acts of terrorism, and•hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other similar natural disasters.Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry. Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:11•downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);•competition from other office, apartment and commercial buildings;•local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, apartments or other commercial space;•changes in interest rates and availability of financing;•vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;•increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;•civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;•significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;•declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and•decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition. Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole or by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the current dislocations in the credit markets and general global economic recession. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition as a result of the following, among other potential consequences:•the financial condition of our tenants may be adversely affected which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;•significant job losses within our tenants may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;•our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;•reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; and•one or more lenders could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all.Real estate investments are illiquid, and we may not be able to sell properties if and when it is appropriate to do so. Real estate generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to dispose of properties promptly in response to economic or other conditions. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to sell properties (without incurring significant tax costs) in some situations when it may be otherwise economically advantageous to do so, thereby adversely affecting returns to stockholders and adversely impacting our ability to meet our obligations.General real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values. Real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks. If the communities and other real estate investments do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including debt service and Expenditures, cash flow, and the ability to make distributions, the operating income will be adversely affected. Income from the communities may be further adversely affected by, among other things, the following factors:•changes in the general or local economic climate, including layoffs, plant closings, industry slowdowns, relocations of significant local employers, and other events negatively impacting local employment rates and wages and the local economy;12•local economic conditions in which the communities are located, such as oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing;•adverse economic or market conditions due to COVID – 19 pandemic leading to a temporary or permanent move by tenants and/or prospective tenants from locations in which our communities are located;•the attractiveness and desirability of our communities to tenants, including, without limitation, the size and amenity offerings of our units, our technology offerings and our ability to identify and cost effectively implement new, relevant technologies and to keep up with constantly changing consumer demand for the latest innovations, including any increased requirements due to the significant increase in the number of people who continue to “work from home”;•inflationary environments in which the cost to operate and maintain communities increases at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents or deflationary environments where we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under our short-term leases;•competition from other available housing alternatives;•changes in rent control or stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing and other increasing regulation on people and business in locations where our communities are located;•our ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance;•declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;•any decline in or tenants’ perceptions of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located; and•changes in interest rates and availability of financing.As leases at the communities expire, tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us. Income and real estate values may also be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988, permanent and temporary rent controls, rent stabilization laws, other laws regulating housing that may prevent us from raising rents to offset increased operating expenses, and tax laws.National and regional economic environments can negatively impact our liquidity and operating results. Our forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the southeastern and southwestern states. In the event of a recession or other negative economic effects, including as a result of the COVID – 19 pandemic, we could incur reductions in rental rates, occupancy levels, property valuations and increases in operating costs, such as advertising and turnover expenses. Any such recession or similar event may affect consumer confidence and spending and negatively impact the volume and pricing of real estate transactions, which could negatively affect our liquidity and its ability to vary its portfolio promptly in responses to changes to the economy. Further, if residents do not experience increases in their income, they may be unable or unwilling to pay rent increases, and delinquency in rent payments and rent defaults may increase as well as vacancy rates"

1,ARL,AMERICAN REALTY INVESTORS,2017-03-31,"ITEM 1A.                        RISK FACTORS  An investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information in this report before trading our securities. Risk Factors
 Related to our Business  Adverse events concerning our existing tenants or negative market conditions affecting our existing tenants could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, release space, collect rent or renew leases, and thus could adversely affect cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.  Cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which the Company has limited or no control, such as: ●lack of demand for space in areas where the properties are located; ●inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants; ●oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates; ●defaults by tenants or failure to pay rent on a timely basis; ●the need to periodically renovate and repair marketable space; ●physical damage to properties; ●economic or physical decline of the areas where properties are located; and ●potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time. At any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to the Company. If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent the space. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for space that is re-let, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and debt service payments, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental income from the properties. We may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in our industry.  We experience a great deal of competition in attracting tenants for the properties and in locating land to develop and properties to acquire. In our effort to lease properties, we compete for tenants with a broad spectrum of other landlords in each of the markets. These competitors include, among others, publicly-held REITs, privately-held entities, individual property owners and tenants who wish to sublease their space. Some of these competitors may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial terms than we are able to offer. If the availability of land or high quality properties in our markets diminishes, operating results could be adversely affected. We may experience increased operating costs which could adversely affect our financial results and the value of our properties. Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as insurance, cleaning, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping, repairs, and maintenance of the properties. While some current tenants are obligated by their leases to reimburse us for a portion of these costs, there is no assurance that these tenants will make such payments or agree to pay these costs upon renewal or new tenants will agree to pay these costs. If operating expenses increase in our markets, we may not be able to increase rents or reimbursements in all of these markets to offset the increased expenses, without at the same time decreasing occupancy rates. If this occurs, our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness could be adversely affected. 8   Our ability to achieve growth in operating income depends in part on its ability to develop additional properties. We intend to continue to develop properties where warranted by market conditions. We have a number of ongoing development and land projects being readied for commencement. Additionally, general construction and development activities include the following risks: ●construction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability for that property; ●construction costs may exceed original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased cost of materials, labor or other costs, possibly making the property less profitable because of inability to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs; ●some developments may fail to achieve expectations, possibly making them less profitable; ●we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project; ●we may abandon development opportunities after the initial exploration, which may result in failure to recover costs already incurred. If we determine to alter or discontinue its development efforts, future costs of the investment may be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized and we may determine the investment is impaired resulting in a loss; ●we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects which will not be completed; and ●occupancy rates and rents at newly-completed properties may fluctuate depending on various factors including market and economic conditions, and may result in lower than projected rental rates and reduced income from operations. We face risks associated with property acquisitions. We acquire individual properties and various portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so. Acquisition activities are subject to the following risks: ●when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the seller’s offering price; ●acquired properties may fail to perform as expected; ●the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than original estimates; ●acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and ●we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into existing operations, and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. However, if an unknown liability was later asserted against the acquired properties, we might be required to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect cash flow. Many of our properties are concentrated in our primary markets and the Company may suffer economic harm as a result of adverse conditions in those markets. Our properties are located principally in specific geographic areas in the southwestern, southeastern, and mid-western United States. The Company’s overall performance is largely dependent on economic conditions in those regions. We are leveraged and may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. We had total indebtedness at December 31, 2016 of approximately $867.7 million. Substantially all assets have been pledged to secure debt. These borrowings increase the risk of loss because they represent a prior claim on assets and most require fixed payments regardless of profitability. Our leveraged position makes us vulnerable to declines in the general economy and may limit the Company’s ability to pursue other business opportunities in the future. 9   We may not be able to access financial markets to obtain capital on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms. We rely on proceeds from property dispositions and third party capital sources for a portion of our capital needs, including capital for acquisitions and development. The public debt and equity markets are also among the sources upon which the Company relies. There is no guarantee that we will be able to access these markets or any other source of capital. The ability to access the public debt and equity markets depends on a variety of factors, including: ●general economic conditions affecting these markets; ●our own financial structure and performance; ●the market’s opinion of real estate companies in general; and ●the market’s opinion of real estate companies that own similar properties. We may suffer adverse effects as a result of terms and covenants relating to the Company’s indebtedness. Required payments on our indebtedness generally are not reduced if the economic performance of the portfolio declines. If the economic performance declines, net income, cash flow from operations and cash available for distribution to stockholders may be reduced. If payments on debt cannot be made, we could sustain a loss or suffer judgments, or in the case of mortgages, suffer foreclosures by mortgagees. Further, some obligations contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which means that a default on one obligation may constitute a default on other obligations. We anticipate only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the maturing debt. If principal balances due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended, or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as the proceeds of sales of assets or new equity capital, cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant “balloon” payments come due. Our credit facilities and unsecured debt contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on the ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our continued ability to borrow is subject to compliance with financial and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under credit facilities, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available, or be available only on terms that are detrimental to the Company. Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock. The degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. The degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the general economy. An increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt. We currently have, and may incur more, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will the interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures. Unbudgeted capital expenditures or cost overruns could adversely affect business operations and cash flow. If capital expenditures for ongoing or planned development projects or renovations exceed expectations, the additional cost of these expenditures could have an adverse effect on business operations and cash flow. In addition, we might not have access to funds on a timely basis to pay for the unexpected expenditures. Construction costs are funded in large part through construction financing, which the Company may guarantee. The Company’s obligation to pay interest on this financing continues until the rental project is completed, leased-up and permanent financing is obtained, or the project is sold, or the construction loan is otherwise paid. Unexpected delays in completion of one or more ongoing projects could also have a significant adverse impact on business operations and cash flow. We may need to sell properties from time to time for cash flow purposes. Because of the lack of liquidity of real estate investments generally, our ability to respond to changing circumstances may be limited. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In the event that we must sell assets to generate cash flow, we cannot predict whether there will be a market for those assets in the time period desired, or whether we will be able to sell the assets at a price that will allow the Company to fully recoup its investment. We may not be able to realize the full potential value of the assets and may incur costs related to the early extinguishment of the debt secured by such assets. 10   We intend to devote resources to the development of new projects. We plan to continue developing new projects as opportunities arise in the future. Development and construction activities entail a number of risks, including but not limited to the following: ●we may abandon a project after spending time and money determining its feasibility; ●construction costs may materially exceed original estimates; ●the revenue from a new project may not be enough to make it profitable or generate a positive cash flow; ●we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development of a property, if at all; ●we may not complete construction and lease-ups on schedule, resulting in increased development or carrying costs; and ●we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, necessary governmental permits. The overall business is subject to all of the risks associated with the real estate industry. We are subject to all risks incident to investment in real estate, many of which relate to the general lack of liquidity of real estate investments, including, but not limited to: ●our real estate assets are concentrated primarily in the southwest and any deterioration in the general economic conditions of this region could have an adverse effect; ●changes in interest rates may make the ability to satisfy overall debt service requirements more burdensome; ●lack of availability of financing may render the purchase, sale or refinancing of a property more difficult or unattractive; ●changes in real estate and zoning laws; ●increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs; ●federal or local regulations or rent controls; ●acts of terrorism, and ●hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other similar natural disasters. Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.  Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties: ●downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment); ●competition from other office, apartment and commercial buildings; ●local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, apartments or other commercial space; ●changes in interest rates and availability of financing; ●vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space; ●increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs; ●civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses; ●significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property; ●declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and ●decreases in the underlying value of our real estate. 11   Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition.  Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole or by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the current dislocations in the credit markets and general global economic recession. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition as a result of the following, among other potential consequences: ●the financial condition of our tenants may be adversely affected which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons; ●significant job losses within our tenants may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; ●our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense; ●reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; and ●one or more lenders could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all. Real estate investments are illiquid, and the Company may not be able to sell properties if and when it is appropriate to do so.  Real estate generally cannot be sold quickly.

Some of these competitors may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial terms than we are able to offer. If the availability of land or high quality properties in our markets diminishes, operating results could be adversely affected. 8  We may experience increased operating costs which could adversely affect our financial results and the value of our properties.  Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as insurance, cleaning, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping, repairs, and maintenance of the properties. While some current tenants are obligated by their leases to reimburse us for a portion of these costs, there is no assurance that these tenants will make such payments or agree to pay these costs upon renewal or new tenants will agree to pay these costs. If operating expenses increase in our markets, we may not be able to increase rents or reimbursements in all of these markets to offset the increased expenses, without at the same time decreasing occupancy rates. If this occurs, our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness could be adversely affected. Our ability to achieve growth in operating income depends in part on its ability to develop additional properties. We intend to continue to develop properties where warranted by market conditions. We have a number of ongoing development and land projects being readied for commencement. Additionally, general construction and development activities include the following risks: ·construction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability for that property; ·construction costs may exceed original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased cost of materials, labor or other costs, possibly making the property less profitable because of inability to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs; ·some developments may fail to achieve expectations, possibly making them less profitable; ·we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project; ·we may abandon development opportunities after the initial exploration, which may result in failure to recover costs already incurred. If we determine to alter or discontinue its development efforts, future costs of the investment may be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized and we may determine the investment is impaired resulting in a loss; ·we may expend funds on and devote management’s time to projects which will not be completed; and ·occupancy rates and rents at newly-completed properties may fluctuate depending on various factors including market and economic conditions, and may result in lower than projected rental rates and reduced income from operations. We face risks associated with property acquisitions. We acquire individual properties and various portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so. Acquisition activities are subject to the following risks: ·when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the seller’s offering price; ·acquired properties may fail to perform as expected; ·the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than original estimates; ·acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and ·we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into existing operations, and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. However, if an unknown liability was later asserted against the acquired properties, we might be required to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect cash flow. Many of our properties are concentrated in our primary markets and the Company may suffer economic harm as a result of adverse conditions in those markets. Our properties are located principally in specific geographic areas in the southwestern, southeastern, and mid-western United States. The Company’s overall performance is largely dependent on economic conditions in those regions. 9  We are leveraged and may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. We had total indebtedness at December 31, 2015 of approximately $821.5 million. Substantially all assets have been pledged to secure debt. These borrowings increase the risk of loss because they represent a prior claim on assets and most require fixed payments regardless of profitability. Our leveraged position makes us vulnerable to declines in the general economy and may limit the Company’s ability to pursue other business opportunities in the future. We may not be able to access financial markets to obtain capital on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms. We rely on proceeds from property dispositions and third party capital sources for a portion of our capital needs, including capital for acquisitions and development. The public debt and equity markets are also among the sources upon which the Company relies. There is no guarantee that we will be able to access these markets or any other source of capital. The ability to access the public debt and equity markets depends on a variety of factors, including: ·general economic conditions affecting these markets; ·our own financial structure and performance; ·the market’s opinion of real estate companies in general; and ·the market’s opinion of real estate companies that own similar properties. We may suffer adverse effects as a result of terms and covenants relating to the Company’s indebtedness. Required payments on our indebtedness generally are not reduced if the economic performance of the portfolio declines. If the economic performance declines, net income, cash flow from operations and cash available for distribution to stockholders may be reduced. If payments on debt cannot be made, we could sustain a loss or suffer judgments, or in the case of mortgages, suffer foreclosures by mortgagees. Further, some obligations contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which means that a default on one obligation may constitute a default on other obligations. We anticipate only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the maturing debt. If principal balances due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended, or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as the proceeds of sales of assets or new equity capital, cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant “balloon” payments come due. Our credit facilities and unsecured debt contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on the ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt. Our continued ability to borrow is subject to compliance with financial and other covenants. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under credit facilities, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available, or be available only on terms that are detrimental to the Company. Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock. The degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. The degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the general economy. An increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt. We currently have, and may incur more, indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will the interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures. Unbudgeted capital expenditures or cost overruns could adversely affect business operations and cash flow. If capital expenditures for ongoing or planned development projects or renovations exceed expectations, the additional cost of these expenditures could have an adverse effect on business operations and cash flow. In addition, we might not have access to funds on a timely basis to pay for the unexpected expenditures. Construction costs are funded in large part through construction financing, which the Company may guarantee. The Company’s obligation to pay interest on this financing continues until the rental project is completed, leased-up and permanent financing is obtained, or the project is sold, or the construction loan is otherwise paid. Unexpected delays in completion of one or more ongoing projects could also have a significant adverse impact on business operations and cash flow. 10  We may need to sell properties from time to time for cash flow purposes. Because of the lack of liquidity of real estate investments generally, our ability to respond to changing circumstances may be limited. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In the event that we must sell assets to generate cash flow, we cannot predict whether there will be a market for those assets in the time period desired, or whether we will be able to sell the assets at a price that will allow the Company to fully recoup its investment. We may not be able to realize the full potential value of the assets and may incur costs related to the early extinguishment of the debt secured by such assets. We intend to devote resources to the development of new projects. We plan to continue developing new projects as opportunities arise in the future. Development and construction activities entail a number of risks, including but not limited to the following: ·we may abandon a project after spending time and money determining its feasibility; ·construction costs may materially exceed original estimates; ·the revenue from a new project may not be enough to make it profitable or generate a positive cash flow; ·we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development of a property, if at all; ·we may not complete construction and lease-ups on schedule, resulting in increased development or carrying costs; and ·we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, necessary governmental permits. The overall business is subject to all of the risks associated with the real estate industry. We are subject to all risks incident to investment in real estate, many of which relate to the general lack of liquidity of real estate investments, including, but not limited to: ·our real estate assets are concentrated primarily in the southwest and any deterioration in the general economic conditions of this region could have an adverse effect; ·changes in interest rates may make the ability to satisfy overall debt service requirements more burdensome; ·lack of availability of financing may render the purchase, sale or refinancing of a property more difficult or unattractive; ·changes in real estate and zoning laws; ·increases in real estate taxes and insurance costs; ·federal or local regulations or rent controls; ·acts of terrorism, and ·hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other similar natural disasters. Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.  Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties: ·downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment); ·competition from other office, apartment and commercial buildings; ·local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, apartments or other commercial space; ·changes in interest rates and availability of financing; ·vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space; ·increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs; ·civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses; 11  ·significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property; ·declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and ·decreases in the underlying value of our real estate. Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and financial condition.  Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole or by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the current dislocations in the credit markets and general global economic recession. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition as a result of the following, among other potential consequences: ·the financial condition of our tenants may be adversely affected which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons; ·significant job losses within our tenants may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; ·our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense; ·reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; and ·one or more lenders could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all. Real estate investments are illiquid, and the Company may not be able to sell properties if and when it is appropriate to do so.  Real estate generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to dispose of properties promptly in response to economic or other conditions. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to sell properties (without incurring significant tax costs) in some situations when it may be otherwise economically advantageous to do so, thereby adversely affecting returns to stockholders and adversely impacting our ability to meet our obligations. "
