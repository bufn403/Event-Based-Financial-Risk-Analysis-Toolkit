EMPLOYEES AND COMPETITIONEmployee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in reputational damage and significant losses. There have been a number of cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in recent years and we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or misconduct could occur. Our informational technology, human resources and compliance departments work collaboratively to monitor for fraud and conduct extensive training for employees. However, employee fraud or misconduct may still occur. Instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, misuse of customer or proprietary/confidential information, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses and/or reputational damage.Competition for employees in our industry is intense, and managing key employee succession is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain the key employees and other highly skilled employees we need to support our businesses. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain and attract key and other highly skilled employees. Due to the intense competition in our industry for key employees, we may be unable to retain or hire such employees. In addition, we may experience higher than expected employee turnover and difficulty attracting new employees as a result of uncertainty from strategic actions and organizational and operational changes. Losing any of our key employees also could have a material adverse effect on our operations given their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. Our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in retaining and attracting key employees.In addition, we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our Chief Executive Officer, other members of senior management and other key employees. While we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.We face intense competition in each of our business lines, and technological changes may present new and intensified challenges to our businesses. Our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Our principal competitors are other large multinational insurance organizations, as well as banks, investment banks and other nonbank financial institutions.General Insurance and Life and Retirement compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, and terms and conditions. Reductions of our credit ratings or IFS ratings or negative publicity may make it more difficult to compete to retain existing customers and to maintain our historical levels of business with existing customers, counterparties and distribution relationships. A decline in our position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability.Technological advancements and innovation in the insurance industry, including those related to evolving customer preferences, the digitization of insurance products and services, data ingestion and exchange with trading partners, acceleration of automated underwriting, and use of artificial intelligence and electronic processes present competitive risks. Technological advancements and innovation are occurring in distribution, underwriting, recordkeeping, advisory, marketing, claims and operations at a rapid pace, and that pace may increase, particularly as companies increasingly use data analytics and technology as part of their business strategy. If we are unable to effectively implement these technological advancements in our business, including the use of artificial intelligence, in a way that matches or exceeds our competitors, we may suffer competitive harm as a result, which could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. For further discussion on regulatory developments with respect to emerging technologies, see – Regulation below.Further, additional costs may also be incurred in order to implement changes to automate procedures critical to our distribution channels in order to increase flexibility of access to our services and products. While we seek opportunities to leverage technological advancements and innovation for our customers’ benefit, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if external technological advancements or innovation, or the regulation of technological advancements or innovation, limit our ability to retain existing business, write new business at adequate rates or on appropriate terms, render our insurance products less suitable or impact our ability to adapt or deploy current products as quickly and effectively as our competitors"

reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, modeling for man-made catastrophes, such as terrorism and cyber events, is especially difficult and less reliable given such models are in the early stages of development and therefore, not widely adopted or available. For our Life and Retirement companies, significant changes in policyholder behavior assumptions such as lapses, surrenders and withdrawal rates as well as the amount of withdrawals, fund performance, equity market returns and volatility, interest rate levels, the health habits of the insured population, technologies and treatments for disease or disability, the economic environment, or other factors could negatively impact our assumptions and estimates. To the extent that any of our modeling practices do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such errors may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements will impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which are periodically revised. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).The FASB has revised the accounting standards for certain long-duration insurance contracts. The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-12 – Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, which became effective as of January 1, 2023 and significantly changes the accounting measurements and disclosures for long-duration insurance contracts, which primarily relates to our life and annuity products as well as certain accident and health products, among others. The implementation of these changes has imposed and will continue to impose special demands on us in the areas of governance, employee training, internal controls and disclosure and affect how we manage our business, all of which will impact our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, implementation of the changes could impact our products, in-force management and asset liability management strategies and have other implications on operations and technology.The adoption of this newly issued standard will, and other future accounting standards may, impact our reported consolidated results of operations, liquidity and reported financial condition and may cause investors to perceive greater volatility in our financial results, negatively impacting our level of investor interest and investment.For information regarding the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet required to be implemented, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If our businesses do not perform well and/or their estimated fair values decline, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment and conduct interim qualitative assessments on a periodic basis. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the “reporting unit” to which the goodwill relates. In 2022, for substantially all of the reporting units we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. Our goodwill balance was $3.9 billion at December 31, 2022. If it is determined that goodwill has been impaired, we must write down goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). These write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on goodwill impairment, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates – Goodwill Impairment and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, we had net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance, of $14.8 billion, related to federal, foreign, and state and local jurisdictions. If, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income, which such action we have taken from time to time. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on deferred tax assets, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates – Income Taxes and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 38AIG | 2022 Form 10-KTABLE OF CONTENTSITEM 1B | Unresolved Staff Comments"

 COMPETITION and employeesWe face intense competition in each of our business lines, and technological changes may present new and intensified challenges to our businesses. Our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Our principal competitors are other large multinational insurance organizations, as well as banks, investment banks and other nonbank financial institutions. The financial services industry, including the insurance industry, is highly competitive. Within the U.S., our General Insurance companies compete with other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual insurance companies and other underwriting organizations. Our Life and Retirement companies compete in the U.S. with life and retirement insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, our subsidiaries compete for business with global insurance groups, local companies and the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers. General Insurance companies and Life and Retirement companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, and terms and conditions. Reductions of our credit ratings or IFS ratings or negative publicity may make it more difficult to compete to retain existing customers and to maintain our historical levels of business with existing customers, counterparties and distribution relationships. A decline in our position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability.Technological advancements and innovation in the insurance industry, including those related to evolving customer preferences, the digitization of insurance products and services, acceleration of automated underwriting, and electronic processes present competitive risks. Technological advancements and innovation are occurring in distribution, underwriting, recordkeeping, advisory, claims and operations at a rapid pace, and that pace may increase, particularly as companies increasingly use data analytics and technology as part of their business strategy. Additional costs may also be incurred in order to implement changes to automate procedures critical to our distribution channels in order to increase flexibility of access to our services and products. While we seek opportunities to leverage technological advancements and innovation for our customers’ benefit, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if external technological advancements or innovation, or the regulation of technological advancements or innovation, limit our ability to retain existing business, write new business at adequate rates or on appropriate terms, render our insurance products less suitable or impact our ability to adapt or deploy current products as quickly and effectively as our competitors.Competition for employees in our industry is intense, and managing key employee succession is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain the key employees and highly skilled people we need to support our business. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people, which may be difficult due to the intense competition in our industry for key employees with demonstrated ability. Recruiting and retention of talent has become especially challenging in the current employment market, fueled in part by changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we may experience higher than expected employee turnover and difficulty attracting new employees as a result of uncertainty from strategic actions and organizational and operational changes, including as a result of the planned separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG. Losing any of our key people, including key sales or business personnel, could also have a material adverse effect on our operations given their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. Additionally, we may face increased costs if, as a result of the competitive market and recent inflationary pressures, we must offer and pay a greater level of remuneration to attract or replace certain critical employees or hire contractors to fill highly skilled roles while vacant. Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key employees.In addition, we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. While we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses.

Instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, misuse of customer or proprietary information, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses and/or reputational damage. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the controls that we have in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We have, and may in the future, litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property and to determine its scope, validity or enforceability, which could divert significant resources and may not prove successful. Litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights may not be successful and cost a significant amount of money. The inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. We also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon their intellectual property rights, including patent rights, or violate license usage rights. Any such intellectual property claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages, and in some circumstances we could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers, or utilizing and benefiting from certain patent, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition. "

Wehave taken action to reduce coordination costs and take advantage of economiesof scale by transitioning multiple functions and services to a small number ofthird-party providers. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals ofthese relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remainacceptable to us or such third parties. If such third-party providersexperience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experienceproblems with a transition to a third-party provider, we may experienceoperational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but notlimited to, policyholder obligations), a loss of business and increased costs,or suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverseeffect on our business and results of operations.  For discussion regarding cyber risk arising from third-partyvendors, see “If we are unable to maintain the availability of our electronicdata systems and safeguard the security of our data, our ability to conductbusiness may be compromised, which could adversely affect our consolidatedfinancial condition or results of operations” above.ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONSEstimates used in the preparation offinancial statements and modeled results used in various areas of our businessmay differ materially from actual experience.  Our financial statements are prepared in conformity withU.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), which requires theapplication of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree ofjudgment. The accounting policies that we consider most dependent on theapplication of estimates and assumptions, and therefore may be viewed ascritical accounting estimates, are described in Item 7. MD&A — CriticalAccounting Estimates. These accounting estimates require the use ofassumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation.These estimates are based on judgment, current facts and circumstances, and,when applicable, internally developed models. Therefore, actual results coulddiffer from these estimates, possibly in the near term, and could have amaterial effect on our consolidated financial statements.In addition, weemploy models to price products, calculate reserves and value assets, as wellas evaluate risk and determine capital requirements, among other uses. Thesemodels rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may useincomplete, outdated or incorrect data or assumptions and may not operateproperly. As our businesses continue to expand and evolve, the number andcomplexity of models we employ has grown, increasing our exposure to error inthe design, implementation or use of models, including the associated inputdata, controls and assumptions and the controls we have in place to mitigatetheir risk may not be effective in all cases.Changes in accounting principles andfinancial reporting requirements could impact our reported results ofoperations and our reported financial position.  Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which isperiodically revised.   Accordingly, from time to time, we are required toadopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritativebodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The impactof accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet required tobe implemented is disclosed in Note 2 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements.   The InternationalAccounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued International Financial ReportingStandard (IFRS) 17, Insurance Contracts, with an effective date of January 1,2021.  This new standard will require significant changes to accountingmeasurements for long-duration insurance contracts for many of ourinternational operations. The FASB is also nearing completion of its ongoingproject to revise accounting standards for insurance contracts.  The FASB hasfocused on disclosures for short-duration insurance contracts, which primarilyrelate to our property casualty products, and on targeted improvements toaccounting measurements and disclosures for long-duration insurance contracts,which primarily relate to our life and annuity products.  The effects of IFRS17 are currently under review, while the final resolution of changes toinsurance contracts under U.S. GAAP has not yet been finalized.

As our businesses continue to expand and evolve, the numberand complexity of models we employ has grown, increasing our exposure to errorin the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated inputdata, controls and assumptions and the controls we have in place to mitigatetheir risk may not be effective in all cases.Changes in accountingprinciples and financial reporting requirements could impact our reportedresults of operations and our reported financial position.  Our financial statements are subject to theapplication of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised.   Accordingly, fromtime to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standardsissued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial AccountingStandards Board (FASB). The impact of accounting pronouncements that have beenissued but are not yet required to be implemented is disclosed in Note 2 to theConsolidated Financial Statements.   The FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)have ongoing projects to revise accounting standards for insurance contracts.  TheFASB has focused on disclosures for short-duration insurance contracts, whichprimarily relate to our property casualty products, and on targetedimprovements to accounting measurements and disclosures for long-durationinsurance contracts, which primarily relate to our life and annuity products. The IASB continues to contemplate significant changes to accountingmeasurements for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. While thefinal resolution of changes to U.S. GAAP and International Financial ReportingStandards pursuant to these projects remains unclear, changes to the manner inwhich we account for insurance products could have a significant impact on ourfuture financial reports, operations, capital management and business. Further, the adoption of a new insurance contracts standard as well as otherfuture accounting standards could have a material effect on our reportedresults of operations and reported financial condition.Changes in our assumptionsregarding the discount rate, expected rate of return, and expected compensationfor our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increasedexpenses and reduce our profitability. Wedetermine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based onassumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, expectedincreases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in theseassumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rateenvironment, may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability. SeeNote 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on ourpension and postretirement benefit plans"
15,AIG,AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP,2013-02-21,"ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS Investing in AIG involves risk. In deciding whether to invest in AIG, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. Any of these risk factors could have asignificant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. They could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price ofour securities. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect AIG. These factors should be considered carefully togetherwith the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Further, many of these risks are interrelated andcould occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. Such a combination couldmaterially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  MARKET CONDITIONS Difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may materially and adversely affect our businesses,results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our businesses are highly dependent on the economic environment, both in the U.S. andaround the world. Concerns over continued high domestic unemployment, weakness in the U.S. housing and commercial real estate markets, the ability of the U.S. government to rein in the U.S. deficit,address the federal debt ceiling and reduce spending, and the European Union's ability to resolve its debt crisis, among other issues, have contributed to increased volatility and reduced expectationsfor the economy and the markets in the near term. Extreme prolonged market events, such as the global financial crisis during 2008 and 2009, have at times led, and could in the future lead, to a lackof liquidity, highly volatile markets, a steep depreciation in asset values across all classes, an erosion of investor and public confidence, and a widening of credit spreads. Difficult economicconditions could also result in increased unemployment and a severe decline in business across a wide range of industries and regions. These market and economic factors could have a material adverseeffect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Underdifficult economic conditions, we could experience reduced demand for our financial and insurance products and an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Contractholders may choose to defer or cease paying insurance premiums. Other ways in which we could be negatively affected by economic conditions, include, but are not limitedto:declines in the valuation and performance of our investment portfolio, including declines attributable to rapid increasesin rates; increased credit losses; declines in the value of other assets; impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets; additional statutory capital requirements; limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets; a decline in new business levels and renewals; a decline in insured values caused by a decrease in activity at client organizations;  an increase in liability for future policy benefits due to loss recognition on certain long-duration insurancecontracts; higher borrowing costs and more limited availability of credit; an increase in policy surrenders and cancellations; and a write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC). Sustained low interest rates may materially and adversely affect ourprofitability. Sustained low interest rates can negatively affect the performance of our investment securities and reduce the level of investmentincome earned on our investment portfolios. If a low interest rate environment persists, we may experience slower investment AIG 2012 Form 10-K32 Table of Contentsincomegrowth and we may not be able to fully mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities. Continued low interest rates could impair our ability to earn the returnsassumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued.  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS, INSURANCE AND OTHER EXPOSURES The performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changesin interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including monetarypolicies, domestic and international economic and political issues and other factors beyond our control. Changes in monetary policy or other factors may cause interest rates to rise, which wouldadversely affect the value of the fixed income securities that we hold and could adversely affect our ability to sell these securities. In addition, the evaluation ofavailable-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairments, which may occur if interest rates rise, is a quantitative and qualitative processthat is subject to significant management judgment. Our investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of theeconomy. Our results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our investment portfolio inthe past, and this may occur again in the future. We have concentrations in residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage loans. Wealso have significant exposures to financial institutions and, in particular, to money center and global banks; U.S. state and local government issuers and authorities; and Eurozone financialinstitutions and governments and corporations. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region mayadversely affect our investments that are concentrated in such segments. Our ability to sell assets concentrated in such areas may be limited if other market participants are selling similar assets atthe same time. Concentration of our insurance and other risk exposures may have adverseeffects. We may be exposed to risks as a result of concentrations in our insurance policies, derivatives and other obligations that we undertake forcustomers and counterparties. We manage these concentration risks by monitoring the accumulation of our exposures by factors such as exposure type, industry, geographic region, counterparty and otherfactors. We also use reinsurance, hedging and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures that exceed the limits we wish to retain. In certain circumstances, however, these risk managementarrangements may not be available on acceptable terms or may prove to be ineffective for certain exposures. Also, our exposure may be so large that even a slightly adverse experience compared to ourexpectations may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition, or result in additional statutory capital requirements for our subsidiaries.  RESERVES AND EXPOSURES Our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition are subject to the effects of catastrophicevents. Events such as hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, earthquakes, pandemic disease, acts of terrorism and other catastrophes have adverselyaffected our business in the past and could do so in the future. Such events could expose us to:widespread claim costs associated with property, workers' compensation, business interruption and mortality and morbidityclaims; loss resulting from a decline in the value of our invested assets limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets; loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumptions made in the product pricing; and  significant interruptions to our systems and operations. Fora sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophes, see Item 7. MD&A  Enterprise Risk Management  Insurance OperationsRisks  AIG Property Casualty Key Insurance Risks  Catastrophe Exposures. Insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for losses and lossexpenses. We regularly review the adequacy of the established Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment AIG 2012 Form 10-K33 Table of Contentsexpenseand conduct extensive analyses of our reserves during the year. Our loss reserves, however, may develop adversely. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is acomplex process, particularly for long-tail casualty lines of business. These include, but are not limited to, general liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental, workers'compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages, insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products, as well asexcess and umbrella liability, D&O and products liability. Whilewe use a number of analytical reserve development techniques to project future loss development, reserves may be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factorsthat were relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be due to difficulties in predicting changes, such as changes in inflation, thejudicial environment, or other social or economic factors affecting claims. Any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of timeafter we record the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year or number of years. For a further discussion of our loss reserves, see Item 7. MD&A  Results ofOperations  Segment Results  AIG Property Casualty Operations  Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense and CriticalAccounting Estimates  Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense (AIG Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty). Reinsurance may not be available or affordable and may not be adequate to protect us againstlosses. Our subsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and we use reinsurance as part of our overall risk management strategy. Whilereinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their obligation to pay claims for losses insured under our policies, it does make the reinsurer liable to them for the reinsured portion of therisk. For this reason, reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention and to mitigate losses from catastrophes. Market conditions beyond ourcontrol determine the availability and cost of reinsurance. For example, reinsurance may be more difficult or costly to obtain after a year with a large number of major catastrophes. As a result, wemay, at certain times, be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms. In that case, we would have to accept an increasein exposure risk, reduce the amount of business written by our subsidiaries or seek alternatives. Additionally, we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiaries' reinsurers to the extentthe reinsurance receivable is not secured by collateral or does not benefit from other credit enhancements. We also bear the risk that a reinsurer may be unwilling to pay amounts we have recorded asreinsurance recoverables for any reason, including that (i) the terms of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the parties of the contract, (ii) the terms of thecontract cannot be legally enforced, (iii) the terms of the contract are interpreted by a court differently than intended, (iv) the reinsurance transaction performs differently than weanticipated due to a flawed design of the reinsurance structure, terms or conditions, or (v) a change in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of the laws and regulations, materiallyimpacts a reinsurance transaction. The insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers, or inability or unwillingness to make timely payments under the terms of our agreements, could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. For additional information on our reinsurance, see Item 7. MD&A  Enterprise Risk Management Insurance Operations Risks  AIG Property Casualty Key Insurance Risks  Reinsurance Recoverables.  LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL AND CREDIT Our internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs.We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt, maturing debt obligations and to meet any statutory capital requirements of our subsidiaries. If our liquidity is insufficient tomeet our needs, we may at the time need to have recourse to third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, which may not be available or could be prohibitivelyexpensive. The availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overallavailability of credit, regulatory actions and our credit ratings and credit capacity. It is also possible that, as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or investorscould develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets, and downgrades in ourcredit ratings, may limit our ability to access external capital markets at times and on terms favorable to us to meet our capital and liquidity needs or prevent our accessing the external capitalmarkets or other financing sources. For a further discussion of our liquidity, see Item 7. MD&A  Liquidity and Capital Resources. AIG 2012 Form 10-K34 Table of ContentsA downgrade in ourcredit ratings could require us to post additional collateral and result in the termination of derivative transactions. Credit ratings estimate acompany's ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability of financing. A downgrade of our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies wouldrequire us to post additional collateral payments related to derivative transactions to which we are a party, and could permit the termination of these derivative transactions. This could adverselyaffect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of further downgrades of two notches to our long-term senior debt ratings,AIG would be required to post additional collateral of $226 million, and certain of our counterparties would be permitted to elect early termination of contracts. AIG Parent's ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited. Asa holding company, AIG Parent depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments due on its obligations, including its outstanding debt. The majority of ourinvestments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments or advance funds to AIG Parent in the future because of the need tosupport their own capital levels or because of regulatory limits. AIG Parent's ability to support our subsidiaries is limited. AIG Parenthas in the past and expects to continue to provide capital to our subsidiaries as necessary to maintain regulatory capital ratios, comply with rating agency requirements and meet unexpected cash flowobligations, in some cases under support or capital maintenance agreements. AIG Parent has entered into capital maintenance agreements with certain of our insurance subsidiaries that will require itto contribute capital if specific capital levels are breached. If AIG Parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could beseized by its regulator. Our subsidiaries may not be able to generate cash to meet their needs due to the illiquidity of some of theirinvestments. Our subsidiaries have investments in certain securities that may be illiquid, including certain fixed income securities and certainstructured securities, private company securities, private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans, finance receivables and real estate. Collectively, investments in these securities had a fairvalue of $49 billion at December 31, 2012. The decline in the U.S. real estate markets and tight credit markets have also materially adversely affected the liquidity of our othersecurities portfolios, including our residential and commercial mortgage-related securities and investment portfolios. In the event additional liquidity is required by one or more of our subsidiariesand AIG Parent is unable to provide it, it may be difficult for these subsidiaries to generate additional liquidity by selling, pledging or otherwise monetizing these less liquid investments. A downgrade in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance companies could prevent them from writing new businessand retaining customers and business. Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position ofinsurance companies. IFS ratings measure an insurance company's ability to meet its obligations to contract holders and policyholders. High ratings help maintain public confidence in a company'sproducts, facilitate marketing of products and enhance its competitive position. Downgrades of the IFS ratings of our insurance companies could prevent these companies from selling, or make it moredifficult for them to succeed in selling, products and services, or result in increased policy cancellations, termination of assumed reinsurance contracts, or return of premiums. Under credit ratingagency policies concerning the relationship between parent and subsidiary ratings, a downgrade in AIG Parent's credit ratings could result in a downgrade of the IFS ratings of our insurancesubsidiaries.  BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS Interest rate fluctuations, increased surrenders, investment returns and other events may require our subsidiaries toaccelerate the amortization of DAC, and record additional liabilities for future policy benefits. DAC represents deferred costs that are incrementaland directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. The amortization of DAC associated with our Life and Retirement Services business is affected byfactors that include current and expected interest rate fluctuations, surrender rates and investment returns. Changes in these factors may require our subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization ofDAC and record additional liabilities for future policy benefits. For example, when interest rates rise, customers may buy a competitor's insurance products with higher anticipated returns. This canlead to an increase in policy loans, policy surrenders, withdrawals of life insurance policies, and withdrawals of annuity contracts, causing an acceleration of the amortization of DAC. If DACamortization exceeds the fees we earn upon surrender or withdrawals, our results of operations could be negatively affected. AIG 2012 Form 10-K35 Table of ContentsWeregularly review DAC for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented, and retirement services products to assess recoverability. This review involves estimating the future profitability ofin-force business and requires significant management judgment. If future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, we could be required to accelerate DAC amortization. Periodically,we evaluate the estimates used in establishing liabilities for future policy benefits for life and A&H insurance contracts, which include liabilities for certain payout annuities. Weevaluate these estimates against actual experience and make adjustments based on judgments about mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns, including the interestrate environment and net realized capital gains (losses). If actual experience or estimates result in changes to projected future losses on long duration insurance contracts, we may be required torecord additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense, which couldnegatively affect our results of operations. For further discussion of DAC and future policy benefits, see Item 7. MD&A  Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 2, 10and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our products offer guarantees that may decrease our earnings and increase the volatility of ourresults. We offer variable annuity products that guarantee a certain level of benefits, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB), guaranteedminimum income benefits (GMIB), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV). At December 31, 2012, our net liabilities associated withthese guaranteed benefits were $1.4 billion. We use reinsurance combined with derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to these liabilities. While we believe that our actions havemitigated the risks related to guaranteed benefits, our exposure is not fully hedged; in addition, we remain liable if reinsurers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. Finally, downturnsin equity markets, increased equity volatility or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the liabilities associated with the guaranteed benefits, reducing our net income andshareholders' equity. Indemnity claims could be made against us in connection with divestedbusinesses. We have provided financial guarantees and indemnities in connection with the businesses we have sold, including ALICO, as described ingreater detail in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While we do not currently believe the claims under these indemnities will be material, it is possible that significantindemnity claims could be made against us. If such a claim or claims were successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. See Note 16to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these financial guarantees and indemnities. Our foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations.We provide insurance, investment and other financial products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries. A substantial portion of our AIG Property Casualty business isconducted outside the United States, and we intend to continue to grow this business. Operations outside the United States, particularly in developing nations, may be affected by regional economicdownturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect our other operations. Thedegree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG Parent, as well as its subsidiaries operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatoryrequirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Consequently, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting futurebusiness in some of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations depending on the magnitude of the event andour financial exposure at that time in that country. Significant conditions precedent must be satisfied in order to complete the sale of the common stock of ILFC on the agreedterms. Under the terms of the share purchase agreement (Share Purchase Agreement) we entered into for the sale of up to 90% of the common stock ofILFC (the ILFC Transaction) to an entity (the Purchaser) formed on behalf of an investor group, consummation of the ILFC Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditionsprecedent, such as certain customary conditions and other closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals or non-disapprovals from certain regulatory bodies, including, amongothers:the People's Republic of China National Development and Reform Commission,  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and other antitrust and regulatory agencies, AIG 2012 Form 10-K36 Table of Contentsinsome cases, without the imposition on either party by such agencies of conditions that would qualify as burdensome. Anyrelevant regulatory body may refuse its approval or may seek to make its approval subject to compliance by ILFC or the Purchaser with unanticipated or onerous conditions. Even if approval is notrequired, the regulator may impose requirements on ILFC subsequent to consummation of the ILFC Transaction. We or the Purchaser may not agree to such conditions or requirements and may have acontractual right to terminate the Share Purchase Agreement. Inaddition to other customary termination events, the Share Purchase Agreement allows termination (i) by any party if the closing has not occurred on or before May 15, 2013, subject toan extension to June 17, 2013 if certain conditions are met or (ii) by us if Purchaser has not paid the required deposit into an escrow account upon the later of March 15, 2013and ten days after approval of the transaction by CFIUS. Becauseof the closing conditions and termination rights applicable to the ILFC Transaction, completion of the ILFC Transaction is not assured or may be delayed or, even if the transaction iscompleted, the terms of the sale may need to be significantly restructured. Failure to complete the ILFC Transaction could negatively affect our businesses and financialresults. If the ILFC Transaction is not completed, the ongoing businesses of ILFC and AIG may be adversely affected and we will be subject to severalrisks, including the following:alternative plans to dispose of ILFC, such as through a sale or initial public offering, may be difficult to structure andmay take extended periods of time to implement, depending on, among other things, the global economic and regulatory environments and general market conditions; we may not be able to realize equivalent or greater value for ILFC under an alternative asset monetization plan whichcould impact the carrying values of ILFC's assets and liabilities; we will have incurred certain significant costs relating to the ILFC Transaction without receiving the benefits of theILFC Transaction, and may incur further significant costs if an alternative monetization plan is undertaken; negative customer perception could adversely affect ILFC's ability to compete for, maintain or win new and existingbusiness in the marketplace; and potential further diversion of our management's time and attention. Significant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financialcondition. We are party to numerous legal proceedings, including securities class actions and regulatory and governmental investigations. Due to thenature of these proceedings, the lack of precise damage claims and the type of claims we are subject to, we cannot currently quantify our ultimate or maximum liability for these actions. Developmentsin these unresolved matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. For a discussion ofthese unresolved matters, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If we are unable to maintain the availability of our electronic data systems and safeguard the security of our data, ourability to conduct business may be compromised, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We usecomputer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer, employee, and company data and information. Some of these systems in turn, rely upon third-party systems. Our business is highlydependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filingand paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios. Systems failures or outages could compromise our abilityto perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. In the event of a natural disaster,a computer virus, a terrorist attack or other disruption inside or outside the U.S., our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or businesspartners for an extended period of time, and our employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. Our systems could alsobe subject to unauthorized access, such as physical or electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to ourdata and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, AIG 2012 Form 10-K37 Table of Contentsunauthorizedaccess, systems failures and disruptions. AIG maintains cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential orproprietary information being compromised. In some cases, such unauthorized access may not be immediately detected. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect ourconsolidated financial condition or results of operations. Inaddition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although we attempt to keep such information confidential,we may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protectconfidential information. Furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the European Union or otherjurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. The compromise of personal,confidential or proprietary information could result in remediation costs, legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.  BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF ILFC PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE ILFC TRANSACTION We will be subject to the following risks until we complete the ILFC Transaction:  Our aircraft leasing business depends on lease revenues and exposes us to the risk of lesseenonperformance. A decrease in ILFC's customers' ability to meet their obligations to ILFC under their leases may negatively affect our business,results of operations and cash flows. ILFC's aircraft may become obsolete over time. Aircraft arelong-lived assets requiring long lead times to develop and manufacture. Particular models and types of aircraft may become obsolete and less in demand over time, when newer, more advancedand efficient aircraft or aircraft engines are manufactured. This life cycle, however, can be shortened by world events, government regulation or customer preferences. As aircraft in ILFC's fleetapproach obsolescence, demand for particular models and types may decrease. This may result in declining lease rates, losses on sales, impairment charges or fair value adjustments and may adverselyaffect ILFC's business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The residual value of ILFC's aircraft is subject to a number of risks anduncertainties. Technological developments, macro-economic conditions, availability and cost of funding for aviation, and the overall health of theairline industry impact the residual values of ILFC's aircraft. If challenging economic conditions persist for extended periods, the residual values of ILFC's aircraft could be negatively impacted,which could result in future impairments.  COMPETITION AND EMPLOYEES We face intense competition in each of our businesses. Our businessesoperate in highly competitiveenvironments, both domestically and overseas. Our principal competitors are other large multinational insurance organizations, as well as banks, investment banks and other non-bankfinancial institutions. The insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the U.S., AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,300 other stock companies,specialty insurance organizations, mutual insurance companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries compete in the U.S. with approximately 1,800 life insurancecompanies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, our subsidiaries compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with globalinsurance groups and local companies. Thepast reduction of our credit ratings and the lingering effects of AIG's negative publicity have made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to compete to retain existing customers and tomaintain our historical levels of business with existing customers and counterparties. General insurance and life insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, productpricing, and terms and conditions. Retirement services companies compete through crediting rates and the issuance of guaranteed benefits. A decline in our position as to any one or more of thesefactors could adversely affect our profitability. AIG 2012 Form 10-K38  Table of Contents Competition for employees in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled peoplewe need to support our business. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Due to the intense competitionin our industry for key employees with demonstrated ability, we may be unable to hire or retain such employees. Losing any of our key people also could have a material adverse effect on our operationsgiven their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. Our results of operations and financialcondition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key employees. Mr. Benmosche may be unable to continue to provide services to AIG due to hishealth. Robert Benmosche, our President and Chief Executive Officer, was diagnosed with cancer and has been undergoing treatment for his disease. Hecontinues to fulfill all of his responsibilities and has stated his desire to continue in such roles beyond 2013. However, his condition may change and prevent him from continuing to perform theseroles. Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significantlosses. There have been a number of cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and werun the risk that employee misconduct could occur. Instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, or failure to complywith regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the controls that we have in place to prevent anddetect this activity may not be effective in all cases.  REGULATION Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiarycapital requirements or reduce our profitability. Our operations generally, and our insurance subsidiaries, in particular, are subject to extensivesupervision and regulation by national authorities and by the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financialcondition. The primary purpose of insurance regulation is the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our investors. The extent of domestic regulation varies, but generally is governedby state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments. Westrive to maintain all required licenses and approvals. However, our businesses may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations. The relevant authority'sinterpretation of the laws and regulations also may change from time to time. Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do nothave the required licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, these authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of ouractivities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit them to supervise the business andoperations of an insurance company. Inthe U.S., the risk based capital (RBC) formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Virtually every state hasadopted, in substantial part, the RBC Model Law promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which specifies the regulatory actions the insurance regulator may take if aninsurer's RBC calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those actions range from requiring an insurer to submit a plan describing how it would regain a specified RBC ratio, to a mandatoryregulatory takeover of the company. Thedegree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG Parent, as well as its subsidiaries operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatoryrequirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future businessin certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, depending onthe magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country. Our status as a savings and loan holding company and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform andConsumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, either or both of which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results ofoperations and cash flows. On July 21, 2010, Dodd-Frank, which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financialservices in the United States, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies AIG 2012 Form 10-K39 Table of Contentstopromulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years. We cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimatelyadopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect our businesses, results of operations or cash flows, or require us to raise additional capital. Weare regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and subject to its examination, supervision and enforcement authority and reporting requirements as a savings and loanholding company (SLHC). The FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have proposed revised minimum leverage and risk-based capitalrequirements that would apply to all bank holding companies and SLHCs, as well as to insured depository institutions, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank. As a result of our regulation by the FRB as anSLHC:The FRB exercises general supervisory authority over us. The FRB, as a prudential matter, may limit our ability to pay dividends and purchase shares of AIG Common Stock.  The FRB is required to impose minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements on us that are not lessthan those applicable to insured depository institutions. Inaddition, under Dodd-Frank we may separately become subject to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB as a nonbank systemically important financialinstitution (SIFI). In October 2012, we received a notice that we are under consideration by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) for a proposed determination that we are a SIFI. Thenotice stated that we will be reviewed in Stage 3 of the SIFI determination process described in the Council's interpretive guidance for nonbank financial company determinations. If we aredesignated as a SIFI:We would become subject to stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary toabsorb losses due to adverse economic conditions. We would be subject to stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating torisk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan forrapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress. We would become subject to a new early remediation regime process to be administered by the FRB.  If we are designated as a SIFI and determined to be a ""grave threat"" to U.S. financialstability:We would be required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15:1.  The FRB may:  limit our ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become affiliated with another company;  restrict our ability to offer specified financial products;   require us to terminate specified activities;   impose conditions on how we conduct our activities; or   with approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S.financial stability, require us to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities. Inaddition, the regulations applicable to SIFIs and to SLHCs, when all have been adopted as final rules, may differ materially from each other. SeeItem 1. Business  Regulation for further discussion of this potential regulation. Further,if we continue to control AIG Federal Savings Bank or another insured depository institution, as of July 21, 2014, we will be required to conform to the ""Volcker Rule"", which prohibits""proprietary trading"" and the sponsoring or investing in ""covered funds"". The term ""covered funds"" includes hedge, private equity or similar funds and, in certain cases, issuers of asset backedsecurities if such securities have equity-like characteristics. These prohibitions could have a substantial impact on our investment portfolios as they are currently managed. The VolckerRule, as AIG 2012 Form 10-K40 Table of Contentsproposed,contains an exemption for proprietary trading by insurance companies for their general account, but the final breadth and scope of this exemption cannot be predicted. Even if we no longercontrolled an insured depository institution, Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to subject SIFIs to additional capital and quantitative limitations if they engage in activities prohibited fordepository institutions by the Volcker Rule. Inaddition, Dodd-Frank establishes a new framework for regulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives under which we may have to provide or increasecollateral under the terms of bilateral agreements with derivatives counterparties. These additional obligations to post collateral or the costs of assignment, termination or obtaining alternativecredit could have a material adverse effect on us. This new framework may also increase the cost of conducting a hedging program or have other effects materially adverse to us. Wecannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted, the level and magnitude of supervision we may become subject to, or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations willaffect the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible that the regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank and our regulation by the FRB asan SLHC could significantly alter our business practices, require us to raise additional capital, impose burdensome and costly requirements and additional costs. Some of the regulations may alsoaffect the perceptions of regulators, customers, counterparties, creditors or investors about our financial strength and could potentially affect our financing costs. The USA PATRIOT Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar laws that apply to us may expose us to significantpenalties. The operations of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations, including, in some cases, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, whichrequire companies to know certain information about their clients and to monitor their transactions for suspicious activities. Also, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Controladministers regulations requiring U.S. persons to refrain from doing business, or allowing their clients to do business through them, with certain organizations or individuals on a prohibited listmaintained by the U.S. government or with certain countries. The United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions maintain similar laws and regulations. Although we have institutedcompliance programs to address these requirements, there are inherent risks in global transactions. Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline AXXX may fail in whole or in part resultingin an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The NAIC Model Regulation ""Valuation of Life Insurance Policies""(""Regulation XXX"") requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies withsecondary guarantees. In addition, NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (AXXX) (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to certain universal life insurance policies withsecondary guarantees. The application of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX involves numerous interpretations. At times, there may be differences of opinion between management and stateinsurance departments about the application of these and other actuarial guidelines. Consequently, a state insurance regulator may require greater reserves to support insurance liabilities thanmanagement has estimated. Wehave implemented intercompany reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the capital impact of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX. In so doing, we focus on identifyingcost-effective opportunities to manage our intercompany reinsurance transactions, particularly with respect to certain redundant statutory reserve requirements on Regulation XXX andGuideline AXXX reserves. Our efforts have included the use of an intercompany reinsurance arrangement for Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX reserves and the use of letters of credit to supportthe reinsurance provided by our affiliated reinsurance subsidiary. All of these letters of credit are due to mature on December 31, 2015. The reinsurance and capital management actions we havetaken may not be sufficient to offset regulatory, rating agency or other requirements. In that case, we could be required to increase statutory reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. Ifwe are unable to implement actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX on future sales of term and universal life insurance products, we may reduce the sales of theseproducts or incur higher operating costs or it may impact our sales of these products. New regulations promulgated from time to time may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition andability to compete effectively. Legislators and regulators may periodically consider various proposals that may affect the profitability of certainof our businesses. New regulations may even affect our ability to conduct certain businesses at all, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financialinstitutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions. These proposals could also impose additional taxes on a limited subset of financial institutions and insurance companies(either based on size, activities, AIG 2012 Form 10-K41 Table of Contentsgeography,government support or other criteria). It is uncertain whether and how these and other such proposals would apply to us or our competitors or how they could impact our consolidated resultsof operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively. An ""ownership change"" could limit our ability to utilize tax losses and credits carryforwards to offset future taxableincome. As of December 31, 2012, we had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $40.9 billion,$17.3 billion in capital loss carryforwards and $5.5 billion in foreign tax credits (tax losses and credits carryforwards). Our ability to use such tax attributes to offset futuretaxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an ""ownership change"" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, anownership change will occur when the percentage of AIG Parent's ownership (by value) of one or more ""5-percent shareholders"" (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership changegenerally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax losses and credits carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before theownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year tothe extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax losses and credits carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section 382would depend on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an ""ownership change"", it is possible that a significant portion of our tax losses and creditscarryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income. OnMarch 9, 2011, our Board of Directors adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) to help protect these tax losses and credits carryforwards. At our 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders,shareholders ratified the Plan. At the same time, shareholders adopted a protective amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which is designed to prevent certain transfers of AIG CommonStock that could result in an ""ownership change"". The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an ""ownership change"" by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a4.99 percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of AIG Common Stock. The Protective Amendment generallyrestricts any transfer of AIG Common Stock that would (i) increase the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of AIG stock then outstanding or (ii) increase thepercentage of AIG stock owned by a Five Percent Stockholder (as defined in the Plan). Despite the intentions of the Plan and the Protective Amendment to deter and prevent an ""ownership change"", suchan event may still occur. In addition, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may discourage open market purchases of AIG Common Stockor a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for AIG Common Stock. Accordingly, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may limit a shareholder's ability to realize a premium over the marketprice of AIG Common Stock in connection with any stock transaction. Changes in tax laws could increase our corporate taxes, reduce our deferred tax assets or make some of our products lessattractive to consumers. Changes in tax laws or their interpretation could negatively impact our business or results. Some proposed changes couldhave the effect of increasing our effective tax rate by reducing deductions or increasing income inclusions, such as by limiting rules that allow for deferral of tax on certain foreign insuranceincome. Conversely, other changes, such as lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate discussed recently in the context of tax reform, could reduce the value of our deferred tax assets. In addition,changes in the way foreign taxes can be credited against U.S. taxes, methods for allocating interest expense, the ways insurance companies calculate and deduct reserves for tax purposes, andimpositions of new or changed premium, value added and other indirect taxes could increase our tax expense, thereby reducing earnings. Inaddition to proposing to change the taxation of corporations in general and insurance companies in particular, the Executive Branch of the Federal Government and Congress have recently consideredproposals that could increase taxes on owners of insurance products. For example, there are proposals that would limit the deferral of tax on income from life and annuity contracts relative to otherinvestment products. These changes could reduce demand in the U.S. for life insurance and annuity contracts, or cause consumers to shift from these contracts to other investments, which would reduceour income due to lower sales of these products or potential increased surrenders of in-force business. Governments'need for additional revenue makes it likely that there will be continued proposals to change tax rules in ways that would reduce our earnings. However, it remains difficult to predictwhether or when there will be any tax law changes having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. AIG 2012 Form 10-K42 Table of Contents ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Actual experience may differ from management's estimates used in the preparation of financialstatements. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which requires the application ofaccounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. The accounting policies that we consider most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore may beviewed as critical accounting estimates, are described in Item 7. MD&A  Critical Accounting Estimates. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, some ofwhich are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. These estimates are based on judgment, current facts and circumstances, and, when applicable, internally developed models. Therefore, actualresults could differ from these estimates, possibly in the near term, and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Our ability to achieve our long-term goals, including return on equity (ROE) and earnings per share (EPS), isbased on significant assumptions, and our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from these goals. In setting our long-termgoals for ROE and EPS, described in Part I, Item 2. MD&A  Long-Term Aspirational Goals in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for thequarterly period ended March 31, 2011, we made significant assumptions that include, among other things:the general conditions of the markets in which we operate; revenues and combined ratios of our subsidiaries; investment yields; our subsidiaries' capacity to distribute dividends to AIG Parent; our ability to deploy capital towards share purchases, dividend payments, acquisitions or organic growth;  the impact of a change in our credit ratings on our ability to maintain financial leverage;  the exclusion of the reversal of the tax valuation allowance on shareholders' equity in calculating ourlong-term ROE goal; effectiveness of our cost rationalization measures; regulatory approval of our planned actions (including share purchases, dividend payments or acquisitions);  the overall credit rating implications of our proposed strategic actions; and  general financial market and interest rate conditions. Theseassumptions are not historical facts but instead represent our expectations about future events. Many of these events, by their nature, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties andcontingencies and are outside our control. It is very likely that actual events and results will differ from some or all of the assumptions we made. While we remain committed to ourlong-term aspirational goals, our actual results are likely to differ from these aspirational goals and the difference may be material and adverse. Theaspirational goals and their underlying assumptions are forward-looking statements. Shareholders and other investors should not place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or aspirationalgoals. We are not under any obligation (and expressly disclaim any obligation) to update or alter any assumptions, goals, projections or other related statements, whether written or oral, that may bemade from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

11,AIG,AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP,2012-02-23,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS         We were significantly and adversely affected by the market turmoil in late 2008 and early 2009. In addition, we continued to experience achallenging business environment, as well as volatile market conditions, throughout 2011. As a result, our businesses, consolidated results of operations, financial conditions and liquidity aresubject to significant risks, as discussed below. This challenging environment and volatile market conditions may continue in 2012.     Therisks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect ourbusinesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Many of these risks are interrelated and occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain ofthem may in turn cause the emergence, or exacerbate the effect, of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact on our operations, liquidity and financial condition.   MARKET CONDITIONS     Our businesses, consolidated results of operations and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by marketconditions.    Our businesses are highly dependent on the business environment in which they operate. In 2008 and through early 2009, the significant deterioration inworldwide economic conditions materially and adversely affected our businesses. The global financial crisis resulted in a serious lack of liquidity, highly volatile markets, a steep depreciation inasset values across all classes, an erosion of investor and public confidence, a widening of credit spreads, a lack of price transparency in many markets, and the collapse or merger of severalprominent financial institutions. Difficult economic conditions also resulted in increased unemployment and a severe decline in business activity across a wide range of industries and regions. Achallenging business environment and volatile markets persisted through 2011 and may continue in 2012. As a result, asset values for many asset classes have not returned to previous levels, andbusiness, financial and economic conditions continue to be negatively affected, particularly in light of high unemployment levels. Revenue and budget constraints affecting U.S. municipalities, lendingactivities and the housing and commercial property markets also continue to have a negative effect on asset values. Further, the adverse European economic and financial conditions related to sovereigndebt issues in certain countries and concerns regarding the European Union have contributed to increased instability in global credit markets. If such conditions persist, we may be negatively affectedin a number of ways, including, but not limited to: declines in the valuation and performance of our investment portfolio;   declines in the value of our remaining shares in AIA;   an inability to monetize our interest in ILFC;   increased credit losses;   impairments of goodwill, aircraft and other long-lived assets;   additional statutory capital requirements;   limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;   a decline in new business levels;   a decline in insured values caused by a decrease in activity at client organizations;   an increase in liability for future policy benefits due to loss recognition on certain long-duration insurancecontracts;   higher borrowing costs and more limited availability of credit for AIG Parent and our subsidiaries;  an increase in policy surrenders and cancellations; and  a writeoff of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC). AIG 2011 Form 10-K            29 Table of Contents    Sustained low interest rates may affect our profitability.    We have substantial investment portfolios that support our policy liabilities. Low levelsof interest rates on investments have reduced the level of investment income earned by AIG. If a low interest-rate environment persists, we may experience slower investment income growthand we may not be able to fully mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities. A decline in interest rates could impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in thepricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued.   INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS, INSURANCE AND OTHER  EXPOSURES     The value of our investment portfolio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest rates.    Changes in interestrates can negatively affect the performance of our investment securities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including monetary policies, domestic and international economic andpolitical issues and other factors beyond our control. Changes in monetary policy or other factors may cause interest rates to rise, which would adversely affect the value of the fixed incomesecurities that we hold and could adversely affect our ability to sell these securities. In addition, the evaluation of available-for-sale securities forother-than-temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process that is subject to significant management judgment.      Concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects.    Our results of operations have beenadversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected by a concentration in residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and commercial mortgageloans. We also have significant exposures to: financial institutions and, in particular, to money center and global banks; U.S. state and local government issuers and authorities (as described below);and Eurozone financial institutions and governments and corporations. These types of concentrations in our investment portfolios could have an adverse effect on the value of these portfolios andconsequently on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industriesor geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investmentportfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated. Furthermore, our ability to sell assets relating to such particular groups of related assets may be limited if other market participantsare seeking to sell at the same time.     The value of our investment portfolio is exposed to the creditworthiness of state and municipal governments.    We hold a large portfolio of state andmunicipal bonds ($37.4 billion at December 31, 2011), primarily in Chartis, and, because of the budgetary pressures that states and municipalities are continuing to face in the currenteconomic environment, the risks associated with this portfolio remain. Defaults, or the prospect of imminent defaults, by the issuers of state and municipal bonds could cause our portfolio to declinein value and significantly reduce the portfolio's liquidity, which could also adversely affect AIG Parent's liquidity if AIG Parent then needed, or was required by its capital maintenance agreements,to provide additional capital support to the insurance subsidiaries holding the affected state and municipal bonds. As with our fixed income security portfolio generally, rising interest rates wouldalso negatively affect the value of our portfolio of state and municipal bonds and could make those instruments more difficult to sell. A decline in the liquidity or market value of these instruments,which are carried at fair value for statutory purposes, could also result in a decline in the Chartis entities' capital ratios and, in turn, require AIG Parent to provide additional capital to thoseentities.      Concentration of our insurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects.    We seek to manage the risks to which we are exposed as a result ofthe securities or loans we hold and the insurance policies, derivatives and other obligations that we undertake to customers and counterparties by monitoring the accumulation of our exposures byexposure type, industry, geographic region, counterparty and otherwise and by using reinsurance, hedging and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures that exceed the limits we wish to retain.In certain circumstances, or with respect to certain exposures, such risk management arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms or may prove to be ineffective, or our exposure in absoluteterms may be so large that even slightly adverse experience compared to our expectations may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations or resultin additional statutory capital requirements. 30            AIG 2011 Form 10-K Table of Contents  CASUALTY INSURANCE RESERVES    Casualty insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss expenses.    Although we regularlyreview the adequacy of the established Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense and conduct extensive analyses of our reserves during the year, there can be no assurance that our lossreserves will not develop adversely and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process forlong-tail casualty lines of business, which include but are not limited to general liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental, workers' compensation, excess casualty andcrisis management coverages, insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products, as well as excess and umbrella liability, D&O andproducts liability. A number of analytical reserve development techniques are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will bethe same as in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initialloss reserve estimates for any accident year. There is the potential for reserves with respect to a number of years to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss developmentfactors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or inother social or economic phenomena affecting claims. For a further discussion of our loss reserves, see Item 7. MD&A  Results of Operations  SegmentResults  Chartis Operations  Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense and Critical Accounting Estimates  Liability forUnpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expenses (Chartis and Mortgage Guaranty).   CATASTROPHE EXPOSURES     The occurrence of catastrophic events could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.    Theoccurrence of events such as hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, earthquakes, pandemic disease, acts of terrorism and other catastrophes has in the past and could in the future adversely affect ourconsolidated financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, including by exposing our businesses to the following: widespread claim costs associated with property, workers' compensation, business interruption, mortality and morbidityclaims;   loss resulting from a decline in the value of invested assets to below the amount required to meet policy and contractliabilities; and  loss resulting from actual policy experience emerging adversely in comparison to the assumptions made in the productpricing related to frequency, severity, mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses.     Fora sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophes, see Item 7. MD&A  Enterprise Risk Management  Business Unit RiskManagement  Insurance Operations  Chartis  Catastrophe Exposures.   CREDIT AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS     A downgrade in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance companies could prevent the companies from writing new business and retaining customers andbusiness.    Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. IFS ratings measure aninsurance company's ability to meet its obligations to contract holders and policyholders. High ratings help maintain public confidence in a company's products, facilitate marketing of products andenhance a company's competitive position.     Downgradesof the IFS ratings of our insurance companies could prevent these companies from offering, or make it more difficult for them to offer products and services or result inincreased policy cancellations or termination of assumed reinsurance contracts. Moreover, a downgrade in AIG Parent's credit ratings could, under credit rating agency policies concerning therelationship between parent and subsidiary ratings, result in a downgrade of the IFS ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. AIG 2011 Form 10-K            31 Table of Contents     A downgrade in our credit ratings could require us to post additional collateral and result in the termination of derivative transactions.    Adverseratings actions regarding our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies would require us to post additional collateral payments pursuant to, and/or permit the termination of,derivative transactions to which AIG is a party, which could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. Credit ratings estimate acompany's ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability to that company of financing. In the event of further downgrades of two notches to our long-termsenior debt ratings, AIG would be required to post additional collateral of $267 million, and certain of AIG's counterparties would be permitted to elect early termination of contracts.     Fora further discussion of our liquidity, see Item 7. MD&A  Capital Resources and Liquidity.   COMPETITION     We face intense competition in each of our businesses.    Our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas.Principal sources of competition are insurance companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions. We consider our principal competitors to be other largemulti-national insurance organizations.     Theinsurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the U.S., Chartis subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,200 other stock companies, specialty insuranceorganizations, mutual insurance companies and other underwriting organizations. SunAmerica subsidiaries compete in the U.S. with approximately 2,000 life insurance companies and other participants inrelated financial services fields. Overseas, our subsidiaries compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies.     Asa result of the past reduction of our credit ratings and those of our subsidiaries and the lingering effects of AIG's negative publicity, we have faced and continue to face intensecompetition to retain existing customers and to maintain business with existing customers and counterparties at historical levels. General insurance and life insurance companies compete through acombination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, and terms and conditions. Retirement services companies compete through crediting rates and the issuance of guaranteed benefits. A decline inour position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability.   ADJUSTMENTS TO DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS AND FUTURE POLICY  BENEFITS     Interest rate fluctuations, increased surrenders, investment returns and other events may require our subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs(DAC), and record additional liabilities for future policy benefits, which could adversely affect our results of operations.    DAC represents the costs that varywith and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts.     Wheninterest rates rise or customers lose confidence in a company, policy loans, policy surrenders, withdrawals of life insurance policies, and withdrawals of annuity contracts mayincrease as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns or more stability, resulting in an acceleration of the amortization of DAC. To the extent such amortization exceedssurrender or other charges earned upon surrender and withdrawals of certain life insurance policies and annuity contracts, our results of operations could be negatively affected.     DACfor insurance-oriented and investment-oriented products, as well as retirement services products, is reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitabilityof in-force business. This review involves significant management judgment. If future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, we could be required to accelerate DACamortization, and such acceleration could adversely affect our results of operations.     Periodically,AIG evaluates the estimates used in establishing liabilities for Future policy benefits for life and A&H insurance contracts, which include liabilities for certain payoutannuities. These estimates are evaluated against actual experience and are adjusted based on management's judgment regarding mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investmentreturns, including the effect of the interest rate environment and net realized capital gains (losses). If observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected 32            AIG 2011 Form 10-K Table of Contentsfuturelosses on long duration insurance contracts, AIG may be required to record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense, which could negatively affect our results ofoperations.     Forfurther discussion of DAC and Future policy benefits, see Item 7. MD&A  Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 2, 10 and 13 to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.   GUARANTEES WITHIN VARIABLE ANNUITIES     Guarantees Within Certain of Our Products May Decrease Our Earnings and Increase the Volatility of Our Results.    Certain variable annuity productsthat we offer guarantee a certain level of benefits to the policyholder. These guarantee features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB),guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV). At December 31, 2011, our net liabilities associated with these guaranteed benefits,representing the aggregate amount of the benefits in excess of the related account values, were $1.2 billion. We use reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to mitigate theexposure associated with these liabilities, and while we believe that these and other actions have mitigated the risks related to these guaranteed benefits, our exposure is not fully hedged, and weremain liable in the event that reinsurers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. In addition, downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility or reduced interest rates couldresult in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefits or policyholder account balances, increasing the liabilities associated with the guaranteed benefits and resulting in a reductionin our net income and shareholders' equity.   REINSURANCE     Reinsurance may not be available or affordable.    Our subsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and utilize reinsurance as part of our overallrisk management strategy. Reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention and to mitigate losses that may arise from catastrophes. Marketconditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance purchased by our subsidiaries. For example, reinsurance may be more difficult or costly to obtain after a year witha large number of major catastrophes. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, in which case wewould have to accept an increase in exposure risk, reduce the amount of business written by our subsidiaries or seek alternatives.      Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses.    Although reinsurance makes thereinsurer liable to our subsidiary to the extent the risk is ceded, it does not relieve our subsidiary of the primary liability to its policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect toour subsidiaries' reinsurers to the extent the credit risk is not mitigated by collateral or other credit enhancements. A reinsurer's insolvency or inability or refusal to make timely payments underthe terms of its agreements with our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. For additional information on our reinsurance, see Item 7.MD&A  Enterprise Risk Management  Business Unit Risk Management  Reinsurance.   INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS     Claims under indemnity obligations may be material.    We have provided financial guarantees and indemnities in connection with the businesses we havesold, including ALICO, AGF, AIG Star and AIG Edison. While we do not currently believe that the claims under these indemnities will be material, it is possible that significant indemnity claims couldbe made against us. If such a claim were successful, our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. See Note 16 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements for more information on these financial guarantees and indemnities.   REGULATION     The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, which may materially andadversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit ratings.    On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-FrankWall Street Reform and Consumer AIG 2011 Form 10-K            33 Table of ContentsProtectionAct (Dodd-Frank), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States, was signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existingand newly-created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years. We cannot predict with certaintythe requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financialcondition, require us to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our credit ratings.     UnderDodd-Frank, we may become subject to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB as a savings and loan holding company or a SIFI. AIG expects that when theDepartment of the Treasury ceases to own at least 50 percent of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, we would be regulated by the FRB as a savings and loan holding company. In eitherevent: We would become subject to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB. We cannot predict how theFRB would exercise general supervisory authority over us.   The FRB would be required to impose minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements on us not less thanthose applicable to insured depository institutions.   We may be required to place our financial activities in an intermediate holding company separate from ournon-financial activities (as defined for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act) subject to restrictions on transactions between the two businesses, which could be burdensome and costlyto implement.     Ifwe are designated as a SIFI: We would become subject to stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary toabsorb losses due to adverse economic conditions.   We would be subject to stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating torisk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan forrapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress.   We would become subject to a new early remediation regime process to be administered by the FRB.     Ifwe are designated as a SIFI and determined to be a grave threat to U.S. financial stability: We would be required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15:1.  The FRB may:  limit our ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become affiliated with another company;  restrict our ability to offer specified financial products;   require us to terminate specified activities;   impose conditions on how we conduct our activities; or  with approval of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council), and a determination that the foregoing actionsare inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability, require us to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities.     SeeBusiness  Regulation for further discussion of this potential regulation.     Ifwe continue to control AIG Federal Savings Bank or another insured depository institution, we would become subject to the ""Volcker Rule"", which could place limits on ""proprietarytrading"" and the sponsorship of, or investment in ""covered funds."" The term ""covered funds"" could include hedge, private equity or similar funds and, in certain cases, issuers of asset backedsecurities if such securities have equity-like characteristics. These prohibitions could substantially impact our investment portfolios as they are currently managed. The Volcker Rule, asproposed, contains an exemption for proprietary trading by insurance companies for their general account, but the final extent of this exemption cannot be predicted. Even if we no longer controlled aninsured depository 34            AIG 2011 Form 10-K Table of Contentsinstitution,we might still be subject to additional capital and quantitative limitations under the Volcker Rule as a SIFI.     Inaddition, Dodd-Frank establishes a new framework for regulation of over the counter (OTC) derivatives under which we may have to collateralize previously uncollateralizedswaps. These additional obligations to post collateral or the costs of assignment, termination or obtaining alternative credit could have a material adverse effect on us. This new framework may alsoincrease the cost of conducting a hedging program or have other effects materially adverse to us.     Wecannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted, the level and magnitude of supervision we may become subject to, or how Dodd-Frank and suchregulations will affect the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. It is possible that the regulations adopted underDodd-Frank could significantly alter our business practices, require us to raise additional capital, impose burdensome and costly requirements and add additional costs. Some of theregulations may also affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties, creditors or investors about our financial strength and could potentially affect our financingcosts or result in a ratings downgrade.      We are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses, including with respect to the pricing of policies that we write, and regulatory actionscould make it challenging for us to continue to engage in business in the ordinary course.    Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by differenttypes of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. Regulators have the ability to take various stepsto protect the businesses of the entities they regulate. These steps could include, and in the past have included: restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends to AIG Parent and its subsidiaries;   restricting or prohibiting other payments to AIG Parent and its subsidiaries;   requesting additional capital contributions from AIG Parent;   requesting that intercompany reinsurance reserves be covered by assets locally;   restricting the business in which the subsidiaries may engage;   requiring pre-approval of all proposed transactions between the regulated subsidiaries and AIG Parent or anyaffiliate; and  requiring more frequent reporting, including with respect to capital and liquidity positions.     Inaddition, the premium rates that we are able to charge and the profits that we are able to obtain are affected by the actions of state and foreign insurance departments that regulateour businesses. In addition to thisregulation, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to laws that require insurers to participate in assigned risk plans, or to offer coverage to all consumers or at prices that we might not otherwiseoffer. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.     Requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar laws that apply to us may expose us to significantpenalties.    The operations of certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which requires companies toknow certain information about their clients and to monitor their transactions for suspicious activities. In addition, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control administersregulations requiring U.S. persons to refrain from doing business, or allowing their clients to do business through them, with certain organizations or individuals on a prohibited list maintained bythe U.S. government or with certain countries. The United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions maintain similar laws and regulations. Although we have instituted compliance programs toaddress these requirements, there are inherent risks in global transactions.      Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline AXXX may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and resultsof operations.    The Model Regulation entitled ""Valuation of Life Insurance Policies"", commonly known as ""Regulation XXX"", requires insurers to establishadditional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life AIG 2011 Form 10-K            35 Table of Contentspolicieswith secondary guarantees. In addition, Actuarial Guideline 38, more commonly known as ""Guideline AXXX"", clarifies the application of Regulation XXX with respect to certainuniversal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees. The application of both Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX involves numerous interpretations. At times, there may be differences ofopinion between management and state insurance departments regarding the application of these and other actuarial standards. Such differences of opinion may lead to a state insurance regulatorrequiring greater reserves to support insurance liabilities than management estimated.     Wealso have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the capital impact of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX, including the use of letters of credit tosupport the reinsurance provided by our captive reinsurance subsidiaries. We focus on identifying cost-effective opportunities to manage our intercompany reinsurance transactions,particularly with respect to certain redundant statutory reserve requirements on term insurance and universal life with secondary guarantees (Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX reserves). Forthis purpose, we had a $585 million syndicated letter of credit facility and $215 million of letters of credit on a bilateral basis outstanding at December 31, 2011, all of whichrelate to intercompany life reinsurance transactions. All of these letters of credit are due to mature on December 31, 2015. However, such actions may not be sufficient to offset regulatory,rating agency or other requirements. In that case, we could be required to increase statutory reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs.     Wealso cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to implement actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX on future sales of term anduniversal life insurance products. If we are unable to continue to implement those actions, we may incur higher operating costs and lower returns on products sold than we currently anticipate orreduce our sales of these products.      New regulations promulgated from time to time may affect our operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively.    Legislators andregulators may periodically consider and put forward various proposals that may affect the profitability of certain of our businesses or even our ability to conduct certain businesses at all,including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions, and proposals to imposeadditional taxes on a limited subset of financial institutions and insurance companies (either based on size, activities, geography, government support or other criteria). It is uncertain whether andhow these and other such proposals would apply to us or our competitors or how they could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively.   CHANGE IN CONTROL    Our ability to utilize tax losses and credits carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an ""ownership change"" under the Internal RevenueCode.    As of December 31, 2011, we had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $45.3 billion, $21.3 billion in capitalloss carryforwards and $4.6 billion in foreign tax credits (Tax Losses and credits carryforwards). Our ability to utilize such tax attributes to offset future taxable income may besignificantly limited if we experience an ""ownership change"" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occurwhen the percentage of AIG Parent's ownership (by value) of one or more ""5-percent shareholders"" (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowestpercentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annuallimitation on its pre-ownership change tax losses and credits carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by thelong-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unusedlimitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax losses and credits carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section 382 would depend on the value of ourequity at the time of any ownership change.     Whilethe Department of the Treasury owns more than 50 percent of AIG Common Stock, under guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, we will not be treated as havingexperienced an ownership change. However, once the Department of the Treasury's ownership of outstanding AIG Common Stock falls below 36            AIG 2011 Form 10-K Table of Contents50 percent,it is possible for us to experience an ownership change as a result of purchases of AIG Common Stock by ""5-percent shareholders"". For the purpose of determining whetherthere has been an ""ownership change"", the change in ownership as a result of purchases by ""5-percent shareholders"" will be aggregated with certain changes in ownership that occurred overthe three-year period ending on the date of such purchases, including, for example, the sale of AIG Common Stock that was issued in exchange for the shares of AIG's Series CPerpetual, Convertible, Participating Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the Series C Preferred Stock), but excluding the issuance of the AIG Common Stock that was issued in exchangefor the shares of AIG's Series E Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the Series E Preferred Stock), and the shares of AIG'sSeries F Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the Series F Preferred Stock), both of which were issued under the Emergency EconomicStabilization Act of 2008 and to which Notice 2010-2 applies. Any repurchases of AIG Common Stock by AIG will be taken into account in determining whether there has been an ""ownershipchange"". If we were to experience an ""ownership change"", it is possible that a significant portion of our tax losses and credits carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them tooffset future taxable income.     OnMarch 9, 2011, AIG's Board of Directors adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) to help protect our ability to recognize tax benefits from certain tax attributes inorder to reduce our potential future income tax liability. At our 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders ratified the Plan and also adopted a protective amendment (the Protective Amendment)to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which is designed to prevent certain transfers of AIG Common Stock that could result in an ""ownership change"". The Plan is designed to reduce thelikelihood that AIG will experience an ""ownership change"" by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99 percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of AIG Common Stock. The Protective Amendment generally restricts any transfer of AIG Common Stock if the effect would be to(i) increase the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of AIG stock then outstanding (Five Percent Stockholder) or (ii) increase the percentage of AIG stock owned by aFive Percent Stockholder. While the Plan and the Protective Amendment are intended to deter and prevent acquisitions of AIG Common Stock that may result in an ""ownership change"", such acquisitions maystill occur. In addition, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may discourage open market purchases of AIG Common Stock or anon-negotiated tender or exchange offer for AIG Common Stock. Accordingly, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may limit a shareholder's ability to realize a premium over the marketprice of AIG Common Stock in connection with any stock transaction.   FOREIGN OPERATIONS     Our foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations, liquidity and financial condition.    We provide insurance, investment andother financial products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries. A substantial portion of our Chartis business is conducted outside the United States, and ourintention is to continue to grow this business. Operations outside the United States, particularly those in developing nations, may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreigncurrency exchange rates, political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect our other operations.     Thedegree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG Parent, as well as its subsidiaries operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy localregulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conductingfuture business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financialcondition depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     Significant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.    We are party to numerous legal proceedings,including securities class actions and regulatory and governmental investigations. Due AIG 2011 Form 10-K            37 Table of Contentstothe nature of the litigation, the lack of precise damage claims and the type of claims we are subject to, we cannot currently quantify our ultimate or maximum liability for these actions. It ispossible that developments in these unresolved matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations for an individual reportingperiod. For a discussion of these unresolved matters, see Note 16(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   USE OF ESTIMATES     If actual experience differs from management's estimates used in the preparation of financial statements, our consolidated results of operations or financial condition could be adverselyaffected.    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the application ofaccounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. We consider our accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and thereforeviewed as critical accounting estimates, are those described in Item 7. MD&A  Critical Accounting Estimates. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, someof which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. These estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and current facts and circumstances. Therefore, actual results could differ from theseestimates, possibly in the near term, and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.   AIRCRAFT LEASING BUSINESS     Our aircraft leasing business depends on lease revenues and exposes us to the risk of lessee non-performance.    Our aircraft leasingbusiness depends on the ability of our customers to meet their obligations to us under their leases; if their ability materially decreases, it may negatively affect our business, results of operationsand cash flows.     Our aircraft may become obsolete over time.    Aircraft are long-lived assets requiring long lead times to develop and manufacture. As aresult, aircraft of a particular model and type may become obsolete and less in demand over time, when newer, more advanced and efficient aircraft or aircraft engines are manufactured. This lifecycle, however, can be shortened by world events, government regulation or customer preferences. As aircraft in our fleet approach obsolescence, demand for particular models and types may decrease.This may result indeclining lease rates, losses on sales, impairment charges or fair value adjustments and may adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.     The residual value of our aircraft is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.    Technological developments, macro-economic conditions,availability and cost of funding for aviation, and the overall health of the airline industry impact the residual values of our aircraft. If challenging economic conditions persist for extendedperiods, the residual values of our aircraft could be negatively impacted, which could result in future impairments.   LIQUIDITY    If our internal sources of liquidity are insufficient to meet our needs, we may become dependent on third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, whichmay not be available or could be prohibitively expensive.    We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt, maturing debt obligations and tomeet any statutory capital requirements of our subsidiaries. If we have insufficient liquidity to meet our needs, we may be required to raise additional capital or obtain other sources of commercialfunding. The availability of any additional financing depends on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overallavailability of credit, regulatory actions, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of ourlong- or short-term financial prospects. Disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets, to the extent they persist or recur, may also limit our ability toaccess external capital markets at times and on terms favorable to us and to meet our capital and liquidity needs. Furthermore, if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may beunable to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. For a further discussion of liquidity, see Item 7. MD&A  Capital Resources and Liquidity. 38            AIG 2011 Form 10-K Table of Contents     AIG Parent's ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited.    As a holding company, AIG Parent depends on dividends, distributions and otherpayments from our subsidiaries to fund payments due on its obligations, including its outstanding debt. Further, the majority of its investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. Oursubsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments or advance funds to AIG Parent in the future because of the need to support their own capital levels.      AIG Parent's ability to support our subsidiaries is limited.    Historically, AIG Parent has provided capital and liquidity to our subsidiaries tomaintain regulatory capital ratios, comply with rating agency requirements and meet unexpected cash flow obligations, in some cases under support or capital maintenance agreements. If AIG Parent isunable to provide support to a subsidiary having an immediate capital or liquidity need, the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in the case of an insurance subsidiary or other regulated entity,could be seized by its regulator. In the event of a catastrophe, reserve strengthening or other event, AIG Parent may be required to provide capital to one or more of our regulated subsidiaries. AIGParent has entered into capital maintenance agreements with certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries that will require it to contribute capital if specific risk-based capital (RBC)thresholds are triggered.      Certain of the investments held by our subsidiaries are illiquid and/or are difficult to sell, or to sell in significant amounts or at acceptable prices, to generate cash to meet theirneeds.    Our subsidiaries' investments in certain securities, including certain fixed income securities and certain structured securities, private equity securities,private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans, flight equipment, finance receivables and real estate, which had a collective fair value of $96 billion at December 31, 2011, areilliquid or may not be disposed of quickly. Further, we have a significant remaining stake in AIA, one-half of which is subject to restrictions on transfer and hedging. In addition, thesteep decline in the U.S. real estate markets and tight credit markets have materially adversely affected the liquidity of our other securities portfolios, including our residential and commercialmortgage-related securities and investment portfolios. In the event additional liquidity is required by one or more of our subsidiaries and AIG Parent is unable to provide liquidity, it may bedifficult to generate additional liquidity by selling, pledging or otherwise monetizing the less liquid investments described above.   SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE INTERCOMPANY LOANS AND PLEDGE OF DESIGNATED  ENTITY     We have pledged equity interests in certain of our businesses and other assets to secure intercompany loans made in connection with the Recapitalization and granted other control rightswith respect to certain businesses and assets.    We have pledged equity interests in certain of our businesses and other assets as security for the repayment of theintercompany loans extended to AIG Parent by the special purpose vehicles that held the proceeds of the AIA initial public offering and the ALICO sale (the SPVs, and such loans, the SPV IntercompanyLoans). Although the loan from the ALICO SPV was repaid in full in 2011, the loan from the AIA SPV, which remains outstanding,is secured by the assets that continue to be held by the AIA SPV, including the ordinary shares of AIA and our equity interest in ILFC (the Designated Entity). If we are unable to satisfy ourobligations under the AIA SPV Intercompany Loan, the secured parties may have the right to foreclose upon and sell the assets that secure this loan, which could have a material adverse effect on theoperations of the Designated Entity and could adversely affect the value of the Designated Entity.     Furthermore,so long as the Department of the Treasury holds the preferred interests in the AIA SPV (the AIA SPV Preferred Interests), the Department of the Treasury will have the right,subject to existing contractual restrictions, to require us to dispose of the remaining AIA ordinary shares held by the AIA SPV to the extent necessary to fully repay the liquidation preference on theDepartment of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests. In addition, the consent of the Department of the Treasury, so long as it holds AIA SPV Preferred Interests or the preferred interests in theALICO SPV (together, the SPV Preferred Interests), will also be required for us to take specified significant actions with respect to the Designated Entity, including initial public offerings, salesof the business and significant acquisitions or dispositions and incurrence of indebtedness above specified levels. If any SPV Preferred Interests are outstanding on May 1, 2013, the Departmentof the Treasury will have the right to compel the sale of all or a portion of the Designated Entity on terms that it will determine. AIG 2011 Form 10-K            39 Table of ContentsTheserights could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the Designated Entity and could adversely affect the value of the Designated Entity.   CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER     As a result of the issuance of the shares of AIG Common Stock to the Department of the Treasury in connection with the Recapitalization, the Department of the Treasury is AIG Parent'scontrolling shareholder.    As of January 31, 2012, the Department of the Treasury owns approximately 77 percent of the outstanding shares of AIG CommonStock. The Department of the Treasury is able, to the extent permitted by law, to control a vote of AIG shareholders on substantially all matters, including: approval of mergers or other business combinations;   a sale of all or substantially all of our assets;   amendments to AIG Parent's restated certificate of incorporation; and  other matters that might be favorable to the Department of the Treasury, but not to our other shareholders.     Moreover,the Department of the Treasury's ability to cause or prevent a change in control of AIG could also have an adverse effect on the market price of AIG Common Stock. TheDepartment of the Treasury may also, subject to applicable securities laws, transfer all, or a portion of, the AIG Common Stock to another person or entity and, in the event of such a transfer, thatperson or entity could become our controlling shareholder. The Department of the Treasury's rights under a registration rights agreement executed in connection with the Recapitalization may beassigned to any person purchasing over $500 million of AIG Common Stock.      We granted the Department of the Treasury certain registration rights and, subject to certain exceptions, the ability to control the terms, conditions and pricing of any offering inwhich it participates, including any primary offering by us.    We have granted the Department of the Treasury registration rights with respect to the shares of AIGCommon Stock issued in connection with the Recapitalization, including: the right to participate in any registered offering of AIG Common Stock by us;   the right to demand no more than twice in any 12-month period that we effect a registered marketed offering ofour shares;   the right to engage in at-the-market offerings; and  subject to certain exceptions, the right to approve the terms, conditions and pricing of any registered offering in whichit participates until its ownership falls below 33 percent of our voting securities.      Possible future sales of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury could adversely affect the market for AIG Common Stock.    We have grantedthe Department of the Treasury the registration rights described above. Although we can make no prediction as to the effect, if any, that sales by the Department of the Treasury would have on themarket price of AIG Common Stock, sales of substantial amounts of AIG Common Stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of AIG Common Stock.   EMPLOYEES     Mr. Benmosche may be unable to continue to provide services to AIG due to his health.    Mr. Robert Benmosche, the President and ChiefExecutive Officer of AIG, was diagnosed with cancer and has been undergoing treatment for his disease. He continues to fulfill all of his responsibilities and has stated his desire to continue in suchroles beyond 2012. However, there can be no assurance that his condition will not change and prevent him from continuing to perform these roles.      The limitations on incentive compensation contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the restrictions placed on compensation by the Special Master for TARPExecutive Compensation and in our agreement with the Department of the Treasury may adversely affect our ability to attract talent and retain and motivate our highest performingemployees.    The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contains provisions which, 40            AIG 2011 Form 10-K Table of Contentsasimplemented by the Department of the Treasury in its Interim Final Rule, restrict bonus and other incentive compensation payable to certain AIG employees. Historically, we have embraced apay-for-performance philosophy. Based on the limitations placed on incentive compensation, it is unclear whether, for the foreseeable future, we will be able to create acompensation structure that permits us to attract talent and retain and motivate our most senior and most highly compensated employeesand other high performing employees who become subject to such limitations. The restrictions on our ability to attract talent and retain and motivate our highest performing employees may affect ourability to strengthen our businesses and prepare and make required filings in a timely manner with the SEC and other federal, state and foreign regulators.      Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses.    Losses may result from, among otherthings, fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies.There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee misconductcould occur. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the controls that we have in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.   ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS AND HANDLING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION     If we are unable to maintain the availability of our electronic data systems and safeguard the security of our data, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which couldadversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.    We use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer,employee, and company data and information. Some of these systems in turn, rely upon third-party systems. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessarybusiness functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutualfunds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios. Systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm ourability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. In the event of a natural disaster, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or other disruption inside oroutside the U.S., our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time, and our employees may be unable to perform their duties for anextended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. Our systems could also be subject to unauthorized access, such as physical or electronic break-ins or unauthorizedtampering. AIG maintains cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised. Insome cases, such unauthorized access may not be immediately detected. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results ofoperations.     Inaddition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although we attempt to keep such informationconfidential, we may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls toprotect confidential information. Furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the European Union or otherjurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. The compromise of personal,confidential or proprietary information could result in remediation costs, legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.   REGULATORY CAPITAL CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP PORTFOLIO     A deterioration in the credit markets may cause us to recognize unrealized market valuation losses which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition,consolidated results of operations or liquidity. Moreover, depending on how and when the Basel I capital standards are phased out, the period of time that AIGFP remains at risk for such deteriorationcould be longer than anticipated by AIGFP.    A total of $6.4 billion in net notional amount AIG 2011 Form 10-K            41 Table of Contentsofthe super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio of AIGFP as of December 31, 2011, represented derivatives written for financial institutions, principally in Europe against Europeancorporate loans and residential mortgage loans, primarily for the purpose of providing regulatory capital relief rather than for arbitrage purposes. These portfolios have no direct exposure to anyobligors in the five countries of the Euro-zone periphery (Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Portugal). The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institutioncounterparties was generally derived from the capital regulations promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel I. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision finalized a new framework for international capital and liquidity standards known as Basel III, which, when fully implemented, may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certaincounterparties from these transactions and thus may impact the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions. AIGFP continues to reassess the expected maturity of thisportfolio. As of December 31, 2011, AIGFP estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 0.86 years.     Giventhe current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination of credit protection written by AIGFP and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality of theunderlying portfolios, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP, after taking into consideration weakening economic conditions in Europe, does not expect that itwill be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory capital relief. AIGFP will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitordevelopments in the marketplace. Depending on how and when the Basel I regulatory requirements are phased out, we could also remain at risk for a longer period of time than currently anticipated.   LONG-TERM ASPIRATIONAL GOALS     AIG's ability to achieve its long-term aspirational goals with respect to return on equity (ROE) and earnings per share (EPS) and other long-term aspirationalgoals are based on significant assumptions, and AIG's actual results may differ, possibly materially and adversely, from these goals.    In setting itslong-term aspirational goals for ROE and EPS, described in Item 2. MD&A  Long-Term Aspirational Goals in its Quarterly Report onForm 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2011, AIG made significant assumptions that include, among other things, the general conditions of markets in which itoperates, revenues and combined ratios of its subsidiaries, investment yields, subsidiaries' capacity to distribute dividends to AIG Parent, AIG's ability to apply deployable capital to sharerepurchases, dividend payments, acquisitions or organic growth, AIG's ability to maintain financial leverage commensurate with its current credit ratings, the exclusion of the impact on shareholders'equity of the reversal of the tax valuation allowance, the effectiveness of AIG's cost rationalization measures, the approval of planned actions (including with respect to any share repurchases,dividend payments or acquisitions) by AIG's regulators, the overall credit rating implications of AIG's proposed strategic actions and general financial market and interest rate conditions. Theseassumptions are not historical facts but instead represent only AIG's expectations regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties andcontingencies and are outside AIG's control. It is very likely that one or more of the assumptions will not be met or that actual results will deviate materially from what is assumed. While AIGremains committed to its long-term aspirational goals, AIG's actual results are likely to differ from these aspirational goals and the difference may be material and adverse.     Theaspirational goals and their underlying assumptions are forward-looking statements. AIG strongly cautions its shareholders and other investors not to place undue reliance on any ofthese assumptions or aspirational goals. AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any assumptions, goals, projections or other related statements,whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. See Item 7. MD&A  Cautionary StatementRegarding Forward Looking Information for additional information regarding the forward-looking statements. 42            AIG 2011 Form 10-K Table of Contents"

14,AIG,AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP,2009-03-02,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     AIG has been significantly and adversely affected by recent    events in the marketplace as well as in its businesses, and is    subject to significant risks, as discussed below. Many of these    risks are interrelated and occur under similar business and    economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may    in turn cause the emergence, or exacerbate the effect, of    others. Such a combination could materially increase the    severity of the impact on AIG. As a result, should certain of    these risks emerge, AIG may need additional support from the    U.S. government. Without additional support from the    U.S. government, in the future there could exist    substantial doubt about AIGs ability to continue as a    going concern. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of    Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Consideration of AIGs Ability to Continue as a Going    Concern and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements    for a further discussion. Proposed    Transactions with the NY Fed and the United States    Department of the Treasury No assurance can be given that the NY Fed and the    United States Department of the Treasury will complete the    proposed transactions with AIG.  AIG has entered    into certain agreements in principle and announced intentions to    enter into transactions with the NY Fed and the    United States Department of the Treasury described below    and in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    These proposed transactions are designed to promote AIGs    restructuring. Neither agreements in principle nor the    intentions are legally binding, and neither the NY Fed nor the    United States Department of the Treasury is bound to    proceed with the transactions or complete them on the terms    currently contemplated. AIG, however, expects to be able to    complete these transactions and others necessary to enable an    orderly restructuring and understands that the NY Fed and    the United States Department of the Treasury remain committed to    providing AIG with continued support. If AIG is unable to    complete one or more of the proposed transactions, AIGs    credit ratings may be downgraded and AIG may not be able to    complete its restructuring plan. See Credit and Financial    Strength Ratings for a discussion of the impact of a downgrade    in AIGs credit ratings. The proposed repayment of outstanding amounts under the Fed    Facility with subsidiary preferred equity in holding companies    for AIA and ALICO is complex and may need to be    restructured.  The NY Feds proposed    investment in two new holding companies for AIA and ALICO is    unprecedented and it is possible that the terms of the exchange    may change, perhaps materially. Business    and Credit Environment AIGs businesses, results of operations and financial    condition have been materially and adversely affected by market    conditions and will be materially affected by these conditions    for the foreseeable future.  During 2008,    worldwide economic conditions significantly deteriorated and the    United States economy and most other major economies entered    into a recession. It is difficult to predict how long global    recessionary conditions will exist or the manner in which    AIGs markets, products, financial condition and businesses    will be negatively affected in the future.     The global financial crisis has resulted in a lack of liquidity,    highly volatile markets, a steep depreciation in asset values    across all classes, an erosion of investor confidence, a    widening of credit spreads, a lack of price transparency in many    markets and the collapse or merger of several prominent    financial institutions. Difficult economic conditions also    resulted in increased unemployment and a severe decline in    business activity across a wide range of industries and regions.    Global regulators, governments and central banks have taken a    number of unprecedented steps to address these issues but these    steps have so far failed to prevent financial markets from    declining by a very substantial amount, both in percentage terms    and in absolute terms. It is unclear whether these measures will    be effective or, if effective, when markets will stabilize.     AIG has been materially and adversely affected by these    conditions and events in a number of ways, including:           the need to enter into transactions with the NY Fed and the    United States Department of the Treasury, and to    participate in generally available governmental programs    addressing disruptions in financial markets;           severe and continued declines in the valuation and performance    of its investment portfolio across all asset classes, leading to    decreased investment income, material unrealized and realized    losses, including other-  AIG 2008    Form 10-K    21Table of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries         than-temporary impairments, both of which decreased AIGs    shareholders equity and, to a lesser extent, the    regulatory capital of its subsidiaries;           significant credit losses due to the failure of, or governmental    intervention with respect to, several prominent institutions;           impairment of goodwill in its insurance and financial services    businesses; and           a general decline in business activity leading to reduced    premium volume, increases in surrenders or cancellations of    policies and increased competition from other insurers.     The consequences of these conditions have been more severe for    AIG than for other insurers. Since the third quarter of 2008,    AIGs principal sources of liquidity have been the Fed    Facility and issuances of commercial paper under the Commercial    Paper Funding Facility established by the NY Fed (CPFF).    Authorization for the CPFF to accept new issuances of commercial    paper is set to expire on October 30, 2009, with all    outstanding issuances under the program maturing by January    2010. Since mid-September 2008, AIG has had no access to funding    in public markets.     Certain of AIGs in-force and new business products in its    life insurance businesses provide minimum benefit guarantees and    crediting rates. Low interest rates driven by recessionary or    deflationary environments could result in a negative spread    between the yield produced by AIGs investment portfolios    and the underlying costs of these products. While potentially    providing short-term benefits, long-term profitability of the    business could be negatively affected by this negative spread    and the volume and value of new business could be adversely    affected by low interest rate environments. Credit    and Financial Strength Ratings Adverse ratings actions regarding AIGs long-term debt    ratings by the major rating agencies would require AIG to post a    substantial amount of additional collateral payments pursuant    to, and/or    permit the termination of, derivative transactions to which    AIGFP is a party, which could further adversely affect    AIGs business and its consolidated results of operations,    financial condition and liquidity. Additional obligations to    post collateral or the costs of assignment, termination or    obtaining alternative credit could exceed the amounts then    available under the Fed Facility.  In the third    quarter of 2008, S&P, Moodys, Fitch and    A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best) each downgraded the    credit ratings of AIG Inc. and most of the Insurer Financial    Strength Ratings of AIGs insurance operating subsidiaries.    In particular, S&P downgraded AIGs long-term debt    rating by three notches, Moodys downgraded AIGs    long-term debt rating by two notches, Fitch downgraded    AIGs long-term debt rating by two notches and A.M. Best    downgraded AIGs issuer credit rating from a+ to bbb and    most of AIGs Insurer Financial Strength Ratings from A+ to    A.     Subsequent to the rating actions referred to above, the    following rating actions were taken:           Moodys lowered AIGs Senior Unsecured Debt rating to    A3 from A2 and ILFCs and American General Finance    Corporations (AGF Corp.) Senior Unsecured Debt ratings to    Baa1 from A3. Most ratings remain under review for possible    downgrade with ILFC revised to under review with direction    uncertain.           S&P revised the CreditWatch status on AIGs and AGF    Corp.s ratings from CreditWatch Developing to CreditWatch    Negative in October 2008. Subsequently, S&P lowered its    long-term debt rating on ILFC from A to BBB+, and its    short-term debt rating from A−1 to A−2. The ratings    remain on Credit Watch Developing. S&P lowered its    long-term debt rating on AGF Corp. from BBB to BB+, and its    short-term debt rating from A−3 to B. The long-term debt    ratings were assigned a Negative Outlook. S&P also revised    the credit watch status of AIGs property and casualty    subsidiaries from Credit Watch Developing to Credit Watch    Negative.           Fitch lowered its long-term debt ratings on AGF Corp. from A to    BBB. The ratings remain on Rating Watch Evolving. Fitch also    removed the ratings of AIG, Inc. and its property and casualty    subsidiaries from Rating Watch Evolving and assigned them a    Stable Outlook.  22    AIG 2008    Form 10-KTable of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries               A.M. Best affirmed the Insurer Financial Strength Ratings and    Issuer Credit Ratings of the insurance subsidiaries of AIG, Inc.    In addition A.M. Best affirmed the Issuer Credit Rating of AIG,    Inc. These ratings were removed from Under Review with Negative    Implications and assigned a Negative Outlook.     Credit ratings estimate a companys ability to meet its    obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability to    that company of unsecured financing and its eligibility for    certain government sponsored funding programs such as the CPFF,    as discussed below. In the event of a further downgrade of    AIGs long-term senior debt ratings, AIGFP would be    required to post additional collateral and AIG or certain of    AIGFPs counterparties would be permitted to elect early    termination of contracts.     It is estimated that as of the close of business on    February 18, 2009, based on AIGFPs outstanding    municipal GIAs, secured funding arrangements and financial    derivative transactions (including AIGFPs super senior    credit default swap portfolio) at that date, a one-notch    downgrade of AIGs long-term senior debt ratings to Baa1 by    Moodys and BBB+ by S&P would permit counterparties to    make additional collateral calls and permit either AIGFP or the    counterparties to elect early termination of contracts,    resulting in up to approximately $8 billion of    corresponding collateral postings and termination payments, a    two-notch downgrade to Baa2 by Moodys and BBB by S&P    would result in approximately $2 billion in additional    collateral postings and termination payments, and a three-notch    downgrade to Baa3 by Moodys and BBB- by S&P would    result in approximately $1 billion in additional collateral    and termination payments.     The actual amount of collateral that AIGFP would be required to    post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the    aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make,    would depend on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding    affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time    of the downgrade. If AIG is unable to secure sufficient    additional funding through the Fed Facility or otherwise, AIG    could become insolvent.     ILFC is a party to two Export Credit Agency (ECA) facilities    that require ILFC to segregate security deposits and maintenance    reserves related to aircraft financed under these facilities    into separate accounts in the event of a downgrade in    ILFCs credit ratings. In October 2008, Moodys    downgraded ILFCs debt ratings, and ILFC was subsequently    notified by the trustees under its ECA facilities that it would    be required to segregate security deposits and maintenance    reserves totaling approximately $260 million in separate    accounts. Further downgrades would impose additional    restrictions under these facilities, including the requirement    to segregate rental payments and would require prior consent to    withdraw funds from the segregated account.     For a further discussion of AIGs liquidity, see    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition    and Results of Operations  Capital Resources and    Liquidity  Liquidity. A downgrade in the short-term credit ratings of the    commercial paper programs of certain AIG affiliates could make    these issuers ineligible for participation in the    CPFF.  AIG Funding and affiliates Curzon Funding    LLC and Nightingale Finance LLC currently obtain financing    through participation in the CPFF. As of February 18, 2009,    AIG Funding, Curzon Funding LLC and Nightingale Finance LLC had    $6.1 billion, $6.8 billion and $1.1 billion,    respectively, outstanding under the CPFF. However, in the event    of a downgrade of the short-term credit ratings applicable to    the commercial paper programs of these issuers, they may no    longer qualify for participation in the CPFF and would likely    have significant difficulty obtaining access to alternative    sources of liquidity. AIGs subsidiary, ILFC, participated    in the CPFF at December 31, 2008, but on January 21,    2009, S&P downgraded ILFCs short-term debt rating    and, as a result, ILFC lost access to the CPFF. The CPFF    purchases only U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper    (including asset-backed commercial paper) that is rated at least    A-1/P-1/F1    by a major nationally recognized statistical rating organization    (NRSRO) or, if rated by multiple major NRSROs, is rated at least    A-1/P-1/F1    by two or more major NRSROs. Accordingly, these AIG entities    will lose access to the CPFF if:           AIG Fundings short-term rating is downgraded by any two of    S&P, Moodys or Fitch;           Curzon Funding LLCs short-term rating is downgraded by    either S&P or Moodys; or           Nightingale Finance LLCs short-term rating is downgraded    by either S&P or Moodys. Adverse rating actions could result in further reductions in    credit limits extended to AIG and in a decline in the number of    counterparties willing to transact with AIG or its    affiliates.  To appropriately manage risk, AIG    needs trading counterparties willing to extend sufficient credit    limits to purchase and sell securities, commodities and  AIG 2008    Form 10-K    23Table of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries        other assets, as well as to conduct hedging activities. To the    extent that counterparties are unwilling to trade with or to    extend adequate credit limits to AIG or its subsidiaries, AIG    could be exposed to open positions or other unhedged risks,    resulting in increased volatility of results and increased    losses. A downgrade in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of    AIGs insurance companies could prevent the companies from    writing new business and retaining customers and    business.  Insurer Financial Strength ratings are    an important factor in establishing the competitive position of    insurance companies. Insurer Financial Strength ratings measure    an insurance companys ability to meet its obligations to    contract holders and policyholders, help maintain public    confidence in a companys products, facilitate marketing of    products and enhance a companys competitive position.     Further downgrades of the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of    AIGs insurance companies may prevent these companies from    offering products and services or result in increased policy    cancellations or termination of assumed reinsurance contracts.    Moreover, a downgrade in AIGs credit ratings may, under    credit rating agency policies concerning the relationship    between parent and subsidiary ratings, result in a downgrade of    the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of AIGs insurance    subsidiaries. Liquidity AIG parents ability to access funds from its    subsidiaries is severely limited.  As a holding    company, AIG parent depends significantly on dividends,    distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund    payments due on AIGs obligations, including its debt    securities. Further, the majority of AIGs investments are    held by its regulated subsidiaries. In light of AIGs    current financial situation, many of AIGs regulated    subsidiaries have been significantly restricted from making    dividend payments, or advancing funds, to AIG, and AIG expects    these restrictions to continue. AIGs subsidiaries also are    limited in their ability to make dividend payments or advance    funds to AIG because of the need to retain funds to conduct    their own operations. These factors may hinder AIGs    ability to access funds that AIG may need to make payments on    its obligations, including those arising from day-to-day    business activities. AIG parents ability to support its subsidiaries is    limited.  Historically, AIG has provided capital    and liquidity to its subsidiaries to maintain regulatory capital    ratios, comply with rating agency requirements and meet    unexpected cash flow obligations. AIGs current limited    access to liquidity may reduce or prevent AIG from providing    support to its subsidiaries. If AIG is unable to provide support    to a subsidiary having an immediate capital need, the subsidiary    could become insolvent or, in the case of an insurance    subsidiary or other regulated entity, could be seized by its    regulator. A significant portion of AIGs investments are illiquid    and are difficult to sell, or to sell in significant amounts at    acceptable prices, to generate cash to meet AIGs    needs.  AIGs investments in certain    securities, including certain fixed income securities and    certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited    partnerships, hedge funds, mortgage loans, flight equipment,    finance receivables and real estate are illiquid. These asset    classes represented approximately 31 percent of the    carrying value of AIGs total cash and invested assets at    December 31, 2008. In addition, the steep decline in the    U.S. real estate market and the current disruption in the    credit markets have materially adversely affected the liquidity    of other AIG securities portfolios, including its residential    and commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolios. If AIG    requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess    of anticipated cash requirements or is required to post or    return collateral in connection with AIGFPs derivative    transactions, then AIG may have difficulty selling these    investments or terminating these transactions in a timely manner    or may be forced to sell or terminate them at unfavorable values. If AIG fails to maintain compliance with the continued    listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the    NYSE may initiate suspension and de-listing procedures, which    will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of    AIGs common stock.  AIGs common stock    and other securities are listed on the NYSE. AIG is subject to    the NYSEs continued listing requirements, including, among    other things, the requirement that AIG maintain an average    closing price equal to at least $1.00 over each consecutive    30-day    trading period. The share price of AIGs common stock has    declined significantly since the third quarter of 2008, and    recently has begun to close below $1.00. AIG has not been    informed of any non-compliance by the NYSE, but there is no    assurance that AIG will be able to maintain compliance with the    NYSEs continued listing standards or that, in the event of    non-compliance, the NYSE will not take action to suspend and    de-list AIGs securities from trading. A de-listing would  24    AIG 2008    Form 10-KTable of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries        have a significant adverse effect on the liquidity of AIGs    common stock, making it more difficult and expensive for AIG to    raise additional capital. Fed    Facility and Series D Preferred Stock The Fed Credit Agreement and the Series D Preferred    Stock require AIG to devote significant resources to debt    repayment and preferred stock dividends for the foreseeable    future, thereby significantly reducing capital available for    other purposes.  AIG is required to repay the    five-year Fed Facility primarily from the proceeds of sales of    assets, including businesses. The amount available under the Fed    Facility is permanently reduced by the amount of such repayments    as they are made. In addition, the $40 billion liquidation    preference of the Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual    Preferred Stock (Series D Preferred Stock) issued to the    United States Department of the Treasury accumulates    dividends at 10 percent per year. These dividends, and the    dividends on any other series of preferred stock issued by AIG,    are not deductible for tax purposes.     AIGs significant obligations require it to dedicate all of    its proceeds from asset dispositions and a considerable portion    of its cash flows from operations to the repayment of the Fed    Facility, thereby reducing the funds available for investment in    its businesses. Moreover, because AIGs debt service and    preferred stock dividend obligations are very high, AIG may be    more vulnerable to competitive pressures and have less    flexibility to plan for or respond to changing business and    economic conditions.     A further inability to effect asset sales in accordance with its    asset disposition plan or to do so at acceptable prices could    result in AIG not being able to repay its borrowings under the    Fed Facility. See Capital Resources and Liquidity    Requirements  Asset Disposition Plan for a discussion    of AIGs asset disposition plan. Borrowings available to AIG under the Fed Facility may not be    sufficient to meet AIGs funding needs and additional    financing may not be available or could be prohibitively    expensive.  Additional collateral calls, continued    high surrenders of annuity and other policies, further    downgrades in AIGs credit ratings or a further    deterioration in AIGFPs remaining super senior credit    default swap portfolio could cause AIG to require additional    funding in excess of the borrowings available under the Fed    Facility. In that event, AIG would be required to find    additional financing and new financing sources. In the current    business environment such financing could be difficult, if not    impossible, to obtain and, if available, very expensive, and    additional funding from the NY Fed, United States Department of    the Treasury or other government sources may not be available.    If AIG is unable to obtain sufficient financing to meet its    capital needs, AIG could become insolvent. Borrowings under the Fed Facility are subject to the NY Fed    being satisfied with the collateral pledged by    AIG.  A condition to borrowing under the Fed    Facility is that the NY Fed be satisfied with the collateral    pledged by AIG (including its value). It is possible that the NY    Fed may determine that AIGs collateral is insufficient to    permit a borrowing for many reasons including:           a decline in the value of AIGs businesses;           poor performance in one or more of AIGs    businesses; and           low prices received by AIG in its asset disposition plan.     Such a determination could limit AIGs ability to borrow    under the Fed Facility. AIG must sell or otherwise dispose of significant assets to    service the debt under the Fed Facility.  AIG must    make asset dispositions to repay the borrowings under the Fed    Facility. A continued delay or inability to effect these    dispositions at acceptable prices and on acceptable terms could    result in AIG being unable to repay the Fed Facility by its    maturity date.     While AIG has adopted an asset disposition plan, as discussed in    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition    and Results of Operations  Liquidity     Asset Disposition Plan, this plan may not be successfully    executed due to, among other things:           an inability of purchasers to obtain funding due to the    deterioration in the credit markets;           a general unwillingness of potential buyers to commit capital in    the difficult current market environment;           an adverse change in interest rates and borrowing costs; and  AIG 2008    Form 10-K    25Table of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries               continued declines in AIG asset values and deterioration in its    businesses.     Further, AIG may be unable to negotiate favorable terms in    connection with asset sales, including with respect to price. As    a result, AIG may need to modify its asset disposition plan to    sell additional or different assets.     If AIG is not able to repay the Fed Facility from the proceeds    of asset dispositions and cannot otherwise repay the Fed    Facility in accordance with its terms, an event of default would    result. In such an event, the NY Fed could enforce its security    interest in AIGs pledged collateral. In addition, an event    of default or declaration of acceleration under the Fed Credit    Agreement could also result in an event of default under other    agreements. In such an event, AIG would likely not have    sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations under such    agreements. The Fed Credit Agreement includes financial and other    covenants that impose restrictions on AIGs financial and    business operations.  The Fed Credit Agreement    requires AIG to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity level and    restricts AIGs ability to make certain capital    expenditures. The Fed Credit Agreement also restricts AIGs    and its restricted subsidiaries ability to incur    additional indebtedness, incur liens, merge, consolidate, sell    assets, enter into hedging transactions outside the normal    course of business, or pay dividends. These covenants could    restrict AIGs business and thereby adversely affect    AIGs results of operations.     Moreover, if AIG fails to comply with the covenants in the Fed    Credit Agreement and is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment,    an event of default would result. If an event of default were to    occur, the NY Fed could, among other things, declare outstanding    borrowings under the Fed Credit Agreement immediately due and    payable and enforce its security interest in AIGs pledged    collateral. In addition, an event of default or declaration of    acceleration under the Fed Credit Agreement could also result in    an event of default under AIGs other agreements. AIGs results of operations and cash flows will be    materially and adversely affected by a significant increase in    interest expense and preferred stock dividends    paid.  AIG expects its results of operations in    2009 and in future periods to be significantly adversely    affected by the recognition of interest expense on borrowings    under the Fed Facility and by the payment of significant    preferred stock dividends. In addition, the prepaid commitment    fee asset of $23 billion associated with the Series C    Preferred Stock (described below) was capitalized and is being    amortized through interest expense over the term of the Fed    Facility, which is five years.     The Series D Preferred Stock accrues dividends, payable if,    as and when declared, at a rate of 10 percent per annum, or    $4 billion, on the $40 billion of liquidation    preference, which are not tax deductible. Controlling    Shareholder Following the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock    to the AIG Credit Facility Trust, a trust for the sole benefit    of the United States Treasury, the Trust, which is overseen by    three independent trustees, will hold a controlling interest in    AIG. AIGs interests and those of AIGs minority    shareholders may not be the same as those of the Trust or the    United States Treasury.  In accordance with the    Fed Credit Agreement, in early March 2009, AIG expects to issue    100,000 shares of Series C Perpetual, Convertible,    Participating Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share and at    an initial liquidation preference of $5.00 per share (the    Series C Preferred Stock), to the AIG Credit Facility    Trust, a trust for the sole benefit of the United States    Treasury (together with its trustees, the Trust) established    under the AIG Credit Facility Trust Agreement dated as of    January 16, 2009 (as it may be amended from time to time,    the Trust Agreement). The Trust will hold the Series C    Preferred Stock for the sole benefit of the United States    Treasury. The Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to:           participate in any dividends paid on the common stock, with the    payments attributable to the Series C Preferred Stock being    approximately 77.9 percent of the aggregate dividends paid    on common stock, treating the Series C Preferred Stock as    converted; and           to the extent permitted by law, vote with AIGs common    stock on all matters submitted to AIGs shareholders and    hold approximately 77.9 percent of the aggregate voting    power of common stock, treating the Series C Preferred    Stock as converted.     The dividends payable on and the total voting power of    (i) the shares of common stock underlying the Series C    Preferred Stock, (ii) the 53,798,766 shares of common    stock underlying the warrants issued to the United States    Department of the Treasury on November 25, 2008 and    (iii) the shares of common stock underlying the warrants to    be issued to the United States Department of the Treasury in    connection with the capital commitment facility will  26    AIG 2008    Form 10-KTable of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries        not exceed 79.9 percent of the aggregate dividends payable on    and the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock,    treating the Series C Preferred Stock as converted.     The Series C Preferred Stock will remain outstanding even    if the Fed Facility is repaid in full or otherwise terminates.    In addition, upon shareholder approval and the filing with the    Delaware Secretary of State of certain amendments to AIGs    Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Trust can convert at    its option all or a portion of the Series C Preferred Stock    into common stock.     As a result of its ownership of the Series C Preferred    Stock, the Trust will be able, subject to the terms of the Trust    Agreement and the Series C Preferred Stock, to elect all of    AIGs directors and will be able, to the extent permitted    by law, to control the vote on substantially all matters,    including:           approval of mergers or other business combinations;           a sale of all or substantially all of AIGs assets;           issuance of any additional common stock or other equity    securities;           the selection and tenure of AIGs Chief Executive Officer    and other executive officers; and           other matters that might be favorable to the United States    Treasury.     Moreover, the Trusts ability to prevent any change in    control of AIG could also have an adverse effect on the market    price of the common stock.     The Trust may also, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement    and applicable securities laws, transfer all, or a portion of,    the Series C Preferred Stock to another person or entity    and, in the event of such a transfer, that person or entity    could become the controlling shareholder. Possible future sales of Series C Preferred Stock or    common stock by the Trust could adversely affect the market for    AIG common stock.  Pursuant to the Series C    Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 1,    2009, between the Trust and AIG (the Series C Preferred    Stock Purchase Agreement), AIG has agreed to file a shelf    registration statement that will allow the Trust to publicly    sell Series C Preferred Stock or any shares of common stock    it receives upon conversion of the Series C Preferred    Stock. In addition, the Trust could sell Series C Preferred    Stock or shares of common stock without registration under    certain circumstances, such as in a private transaction.    Although AIG can make no prediction as to the effect, if any,    that such sales would have on the market price of common stock,    sales of substantial amounts of Series C Preferred Stock or    common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur,    could adversely affect the market price of common stock. If the    Trust sells or transfers shares of Series C Preferred Stock    or common stock as a block, another person or entity could    become AIGs controlling shareholder. Change    of Control The issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock may have    adverse consequences for AIG and its subsidiaries with    regulators and contract counterparties.  The    issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock will result in a    change of control of AIG. A change of control of AIG triggers    notice, approval and/or other regulatory requirements in many of    the more than 130 countries and jurisdictions in which AIG and    its subsidiaries operate. AIG has undertaken a worldwide review    of the regulatory requirements arising in connection with the    issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock, and has worked to    achieve material compliance with applicable regulatory    requirements. In this connection, AIG has submitted notices to    regulators in the jurisdictions where its principal businesses    are located, and currently has no knowledge that any regulator    intends to impose any penalties or take any other actions as a    result of the change in control of AIG in a manner that would be    adverse in any material respect to AIG. However, in light of the    large number of jurisdictions in which AIG and its subsidiaries    operate and the complexity of assessing and addressing the    regulatory requirements in each of the relevant jurisdictions,    AIG has not been able to obtain all regulatory consents or    approvals that may be required in connection with the issuance    of the Series C Preferred Stock. Accordingly, no assurances    can be provided that the failure to obtain all required consents    or approvals will not have a material adverse effect on    AIGs consolidated financial condition, results of    operations or cash flows.     AIG and its subsidiaries are also parties to various contracts    and other agreements that may be affected by a change of control    of AIG. Although AIG believes the change of control arising from    the issuance of the Series C  AIG 2008    Form 10-K    27Table of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries        Preferred Stock will not result in a breach of any material    contract or agreement, no assurances can be given that    AIGs counterparties to such contracts and agreements will    not claim that breaches have occurred. If AIG were to be found    to have breached any material contract or agreement, its    consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash    flows could be materially adversely affected. Concentration    of Investments and Exposures Concentration of AIGs investment portfolios in any    particular segment of the economy may have adverse    effects.  AIG results of operations have been    adversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected by    a concentration in residential mortgage-backed, commercial    mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. AIG also has    significant exposures to financial institutions and, in    particular, to money center and global banks. These types of    concentrations in AIGs investment portfolios could have an    adverse effect on the investment portfolios and consequently on    AIGs consolidated results of operations or financial    condition. While AIG seeks to mitigate this risk by having a    broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have    a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group    of related industries or geographic region may have a greater    adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that    the portfolios are concentrated. Furthermore, AIGs ability    to sell assets relating to such particular groups of related    assets may be limited if other market participants are seeking    to sell at the same time. Concentration of AIGs insurance and other risk    exposures may have adverse effects.  AIG seeks to    manage the risks to which it is exposed as a result of the    insurance policies, derivatives and other obligations that it    undertakes to customers and counterparties by monitoring the    diversification of its exposures by exposure type, industry,    geographic region, counterparty and otherwise and by using    reinsurance, hedging and other arrangements to limit or offset    exposures that exceed the limits it wishes to retain. In certain    circumstances, or with respect to certain exposures, such risk    management arrangements may not be available on acceptable    terms, or AIGs exposure in absolute terms may be so large    that even slightly adverse experience compared to AIGs    expectations may cause a material adverse effect on AIGs    consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Casualty    Insurance Underwriting and Reserves Casualty insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and    may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss    expenses.  AIG has announced that it intends to    focus its resources on its core property and casualty insurance    businesses while selling other businesses to repay the borrowing    under the Fed Credit Agreement. As a result, AIG expects to    become more reliant on these businesses.     Although AIG annually reviews the adequacy of the established    liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense, there    can be no assurance that AIGs loss reserves will not    develop adversely and have a material adverse effect on    AIGs results of operations. Estimation of ultimate net    losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process for    long-tail casualty lines of business, which include excess and    umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical    malpractice, workers compensation, general liability,    products liability and related classes, as well as for asbestos    and environmental exposures. Generally, actual historical loss    development factors are used to project future loss development.    However, there can be no assurance that future loss development    patterns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, any    deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors    might not be discernible for an extended period of time    subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve    estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential    for reserves with respect to a number of years to be    significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss    development factors that were relied upon in setting the    reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development    factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the    judicial environment, or in other social or economic phenomena    affecting claims, such as the effects that the recent disruption    in the credit markets could have on reported claims under    D&O or professional liability coverages. For a further    discussion of AIGs loss reserves see also    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition    and Results of Operations  Segment    Results  General Insurance Operations     Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense.  28    AIG 2008    Form 10-KTable of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries     Catastrophe    Exposures The occurrence of catastrophic events could adversely affect    AIGs consolidated financial condition or results of    operations.  The occurrence of events such as    hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemic disease, acts of terrorism and    other catastrophes could adversely affect AIGs    consolidated financial condition or results of operations,    including by exposing AIGs businesses to the following:           widespread claim costs associated with property, workers    compensation, mortality and morbidity claims;           loss resulting from the value of invested assets declining to    below the amount required to meet policy and contract    liabilities; and           loss resulting from actual policy experience emerging adversely    in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing    related to mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. Reinsurance Reinsurance may not be available or    affordable.  AIG subsidiaries are major purchasers    of reinsurance and utilize reinsurance as part of AIGs    overall risk management strategy. Reinsurance is an important    risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line    risk retention and to mitigate losses that may arise from    catastrophes. Market conditions beyond AIGs control    determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance purchased    by AIG subsidiaries. For example, reinsurance may be more    difficult to obtain after a year with a large number of major    catastrophes. Accordingly, AIG may be forced to incur additional    expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient    reinsurance on acceptable terms, in which case AIG would have to    accept an increase in exposure risk, reduce the amount of    business written by its subsidiaries or seek alternatives. Reinsurance subjects AIG to the credit risk of its reinsurers    and may not be adequate to protect AIG against    losses.  Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer    liable to the AIG subsidiary to the extent the risk is ceded, it    does not relieve the AIG subsidiary of the primary liability to    its policyholders. Accordingly, AIG bears credit risk with    respect to its subsidiaries reinsurers to the extent not    mitigated by collateral or other credit enhancements. A    reinsurers insolvency or inability or refusal to make    timely payments under the terms of its agreements with the AIG    subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on AIGs    results of operations and liquidity. For additional information    on AIGs reinsurance, see Managements Discussion and    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of    Operations  Risk Management  Reinsurance. Policyholder    Behavior AIGs policyholders, agents and other distributors of    AIGs insurance products have expressed significant    concerns in the wake of announcements by AIG of adverse    financial results. AIG expects that these concerns will be    exacerbated by the announcement of AIGs 2008    results.  Many of AIGs businesses depend    upon the financial stability (both actual and perceived) of    AIGs parent company. Concerns that AIG or its subsidiaries    may not be able to meet their obligations have negatively    affected AIGs businesses in many ways, including:           requests by customers to withdraw funds from AIG under annuity    and certain life insurance contracts;           a refusal by independent agents, brokers and banks to continue    to offer AIG products and services;           a refusal of counterparties, customers or vendors to continue to    do business with AIG; and           requests by customers and other parties to terminate existing    contractual relationships.     Continued economic uncertainty, additional adverse results or a    lack of confidence in AIG and AIGs businesses may cause    AIG customers, agents and other distributors to cease or reduce    their dealings with AIG, turn to competitors or shift to    products that generate less income for AIG. Although AIG has    announced its intent to refocus its business and certain AIG    subsidiaries are rebranding themselves in an attempt to overcome    a perception of instability, AIG cannot be sure that such    efforts will be successful in attracting or maintaining clients.  AIG 2008    Form 10-K    29Table of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries     Foreign    Operations Foreign operations expose AIG to risks that may affect its    operations, liquidity and financial    condition.  AIG provides insurance, investment and    other financial products and services to both businesses and    individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. A    substantial portion of AIGs General Insurance business and    a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services    business is conducted outside the United States. Operations    outside the United States, particularly those in developing    nations, may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes    in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval,    nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which    could also affect other AIG operations.     The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign    jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as its    subsidiaries operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local    regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities    to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation.    Thus, AIGs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from    conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where    they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country    could adversely affect AIGs results of operations,    liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of    the event and AIGs net financial exposure at that time in    that country. Employees Because of the decline in the value of equity awards    previously granted to employees and the uncertainty surrounding    AIGs asset disposition program, AIG may be unable to    retain key employees, including individuals critical to the    execution of its disposition plan.  AIG relies    upon the knowledge and talent of its employees to successfully    conduct business. The decline in AIGs common stock price    has dramatically reduced the value of equity awards previously    granted to its key employees. Also, the announcement of proposed    asset dispositions has resulted in competitors seeking to hire    AIGs key employees. AIG has implemented retention programs    to seek to keep its key employees, but there can be no assurance    that the programs will be effective. A loss of key employees    could reduce the value of AIGs businesses and impair its    ability to effect a successful asset disposition plan. A loss of key employees in AIGs financial reporting    process could prevent AIG from making required filings,    preparing financial statements and otherwise adversely affect    its internal controls.  AIG relies upon the    knowledge and experience of the employees involved in these    functions for the effective and timely preparation of required    filings and financial statements and operation of internal    controls. If these employees depart, AIG may not be able to    replace them with individuals having comparable knowledge and    experience. The limitations on incentive compensation contained in the    American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 may    adversely affect AIGs ability to retain its highest    performing employees.  On February 17, 2009,    the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery    Act) was signed into law. The Recovery Act contains restrictions    on bonus and other incentive compensation payable to the five    executives named in a companys proxy statement and the    next twenty highest paid employees of companies receiving TARP    funds. Historically, AIG has embraced a pay-for-performance    philosophy. Depending upon the limitations placed on incentive    compensation by the final regulations issued under the Recovery    Act, it is possible that AIG may be unable to create a    compensation structure that permits AIG to retain its highest    performing employees. If this were to occur, AIGs asset    disposition plan, businesses and results of operations would be    adversely affected, perhaps materially. Conflicts of interest may arise as AIG implements its asset    disposition plan.  AIG relies on certain key    employees to operate its businesses during the asset disposition    period, to provide information to prospective buyers and to    maximize the value of businesses to be divested. The successful    completion of the asset disposition plan could be adversely    affected by any conflict of interests between AIG and its    employees arising as a result of the asset disposition process. Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and    prevent and may result in significant    losses.  Losses may result from, among other    things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly    or to obtain proper internal authorization or failure to comply    with regulatory requirements, both generally, and during the    asset disposition process. There have been a number of highly    publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by    employees in the financial services industry in recent years,    and AIG runs the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It    is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct    and the controls that AIG has in place to prevent and detect    this activity may not be effective in all cases.  30    AIG 2008    Form 10-KTable of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries     Regulation AIG is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions    in which it conducts its businesses, and recent regulatory    actions have made it challenging for AIG to continue to engage    in business in the ordinary course.  AIGs    operations around the world are subject to regulation by    different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance,    securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators    in the United States and abroad. AIGs operations have    become more diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope    of regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention.    In light of AIGs liquidity issues beginning in the third    quarter of 2008, AIG and its regulated subsidiaries have been    subject to intense review and supervision around the world.    Regulators have taken significant steps to protect the    businesses of the entities they regulate. These steps have    included:           Restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends to AIG;           Restricting or prohibiting other payments to AIG;           Requesting additional capital contributions by AIG;           Requesting that intercompany reinsurance reserves be covered by    assets locally;           Restricting the business in which the subsidiaries may    engage; and           Requiring pre-approval of all proposed transactions between the    regulated subsidiaries and AIG or any affiliate.     AIG does not expect these conditions to change unless its    financial situation stabilizes. Adjustments    to Life Insurance & Retirement Services Deferred    Policy Acquisition Costs Interest rate fluctuations, increased surrenders and other    events may require AIG subsidiaries to accelerate the    amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) which    could adversely affect AIGs consolidated financial    condition or results of operations.  DAC    represents the costs that vary with and are related primarily to    the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity    contracts. When interest rates rise or customers lose confidence    in a company, policy loans and policy surrenders and withdrawals    of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as    policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns    or more stability, requiring AIG subsidiaries to accelerate the    amortization of DAC. To the extent such amortization exceeds    surrender or other charges earned upon surrender and withdrawals    of certain life insurance policies and annuity contracts,    AIGs results of operations could be negatively affected.     DAC for both insurance-oriented and investment-oriented    products, as well as retirement services products is reviewed    for recoverability, which involves estimating the future    profitability of current business. This review involves    significant management judgment. If the actual emergence of    future profitability were to be substantially lower than    estimated, AIG could be required to accelerate its DAC    amortization and such acceleration could adversely affect    AIGs results of operations. For a further discussion of    DAC, see also Managements Discussion and Analysis of    Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 1 and 8 to the    Consolidated Financial Statements. Risk    Management AIG is exposed to a number of significant risks, and    AIGs risk management policies, processes and controls may    not be effective in mitigating AIGs risk exposures in all    market conditions and to all types of risk.  The    major risks to which AIG is exposed include credit risk, market    risk, including credit spread risk, operational risk, liquidity    risk and insurance risk. Given continued capital markets    volatility, persistent risk aversion, inadequate liquidity in    the markets of many asset classes, combined with AIGs    weakened financial condition, AIG may not have adequate risk    management policies, tools and processes and AIG may not have    sufficient access to the markets and trading counterparties to    effectively implement risk mitigating strategies and techniques.    This environment could materially and adversely affect    AIGs consolidated results of operations, liquidity or    financial condition, result in regulatory action or litigation    or further damage AIGs reputation. For a further    discussion of AIGs risk management process and controls,    see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial    Condition and Results of Operations  Risk Management.  AIG 2008    Form 10-K    31Table of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc.,    and Subsidiaries     Operational risks of asset dispositions.  AIG    is exposed to various operational risks associated with the    dispositions of subsidiaries and the resulting restructuring of    AIG at the business and corporate levels. These risks include    the ability to deconsolidate systems and processes of divested    operations without adversely affecting AIG, the ability of AIG    to fulfill its obligations under any transition separation    agreements agreed upon with buyers, the ability of AIG to    downsize the corporation as dispositions are accomplished and    the ability of AIG to continue to provide services previously    performed by divested entities. AIGFP wind-down risks.  An orderly and    successful wind-down of AIGFPs businesses and portfolios    is subject to numerous risks, including market conditions,    counterparty willingness to transact, or terminate transactions,    with AIGFP and the retention of key personnel. An orderly and    successful wind-down will also depend on the stability of    AIGs credit ratings. Further downgrades of AIGs    credit ratings likely would have an adverse effect on the    wind-down of AIGFPs businesses and portfolios. Use    of Estimates If actual experience differs from managements estimates    used in the preparation of financial statements, AIGs    consolidated results of operations or financial condition could    be adversely affected.  The preparation of    financial statements in conformity with accounting principles    generally accepted in the United States requires the application    of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree    of judgment. AIG considers that its accounting policies that are    most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions,    and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, are those    described in Managements Discussion and Analysis of    Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Critical Accounting Estimates. These accounting estimates    require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly    uncertain at the time of estimation. For example, recent market    volatility and declines in liquidity have made it more difficult    to value certain of AIGs invested assets and the    obligations and collateral relating to certain financial    instruments issued or held by AIG, such as AIGFPs super    senior credit default swap portfolio. Additionally, the    recoverability of deferred tax assets depends in large part on    assumptions about future profitability. These estimates, by    their nature, are based on judgment and current facts and    circumstances. Therefore, actual results could differ from these    estimates, possibly in the near term, and could have a material    effect on the consolidated financial statements. Legal    Proceedings Significant legal proceedings may adversely affect AIGs    results of operations.  AIG is party to numerous    legal proceedings, including securities class actions and    regulatory or governmental investigations. Due to the nature of    the litigation, the lack of precise damage claims and the type    of claims made against AIG, AIG cannot currently quantify its    ultimate liability for these actions. It is possible that    developments in these unresolved matters could have a material    adverse effect on AIGs consolidated financial condition or    consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting    period. For a discussion of these unresolved matters, see    Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Aircraft    Suppliers There are limited suppliers of aircraft and    engines.  The supply of jet transport aircraft,    which ILFC purchases and leases, is dominated by two airframe    manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus, and a limited number of engine    manufacturers. As a result, ILFC is dependent on the    manufacturers success in remaining financially stable,    producing aircraft and related components which meet the    airlines demands, both in type and quantity, and    fulfilling their contractual obligations to ILFC. Competition    between the manufacturers for market share is intense and may    lead to instances of deep discounting for certain aircraft types    that could negatively affect ILFCs competitive pricing. "
6,AIG,AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP,2008-02-28,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
Casualty Insurance Underwriting andReservesCasualty insurance liabilities are difficult to predict andmay exceed the related reserves for losses and lossexpenses. Although AIG annually reviews the adequacy of theestablished reserve for losses and loss expenses, there can beno assurance that AIGs loss reserves will not developadversely and have a material effect on AIGs results ofoperations. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses andloss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty linesof business, which include excess and umbrella liability,D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workerscompensation, general liability, products liability and relatedclasses, as well as for asbestos and environmental exposures.Generally, actual historical loss development factors are usedto project future loss development. However, there can be noassurance that future loss development patterns will be the sameas in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends orin loss development factors might not be discernible for anextended period of time subsequent to the recording of theinitial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus,there is the potential for reserves with respect to a number ofyears to be significantly affected by changes in loss costtrends or loss development factors that were relied upon insetting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or lossdevelopment factors could be attributable to changes ininflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social oreconomic phenomena affecting claims, such as the effects thatthe recent disruption in the credit markets could have onreported claims under D&O or professional liabilitycoverages.

During the second half of 2007,disruption in the global credit markets, coupled with therepricing of credit risk, and the U.S. housing marketdeterioration created increasingly difficult conditions in thefinancial markets. These conditions have resulted in greatervolatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and alack of price transparency in certain markets. These conditionscontinue to adversely affect Mortgage Guarantys results ofoperations and the fair value of the AIGFP super senior creditdefault swap portfolio and contribute to higher levels offinance receivables delinquencies at AGF and to the severe andrapid decline in the fair value of certain investmentsecurities, particularly those backed by U.S. residentialmortgage loans. It is difficult to predict how long theseconditions will exist and how AIGs markets, products andbusinesses will continue to be adversely affected. Accordingly,these conditions could adversely affect AIGs consolidatedfinancial condition or results of operations in future periods.In addition, litigation and regulatory or governmentalinvestigations and inquiries have been commenced against AIGrelated to these events and AIG may become subject to furtherlitigation and regulatory or governmental scrutiny as a resultof these events.Risk ManagementAIG is exposed to a number of significant risks, andAIGs risk management processes and controls may not befully effective in mitigating AIGs risk exposures in allmarket conditions and to all types of risk. The major risksto which AIG is exposed include: credit risk, market risk,operational risk, liquidity risk and insurance risk. AIG hasdevoted significant resources to the development andimplementation of risk management processes and controls acrossAIGs operations, including by establishing review andoversight committees to monitor risks, setting limits andidentifying risk mitigating strategies and techniques.Nonetheless, these procedures may not be fully effective inmitigating risk exposure in all market conditions, some of whichchange rapidly and severely. A failure of AIGs riskmanagement processes or the ineffectiveness of AIGs riskmitigating strategies and techniques could adversely affect,perhaps materially, AIGs consolidated results ofoperations, liquidity or financial condition, result inregulatory action or litigation or damage AIGs reputation.See Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations  Risk Management.LiquidityAIGs liquidity could be impaired by an inability toaccess the capital markets or by unforeseen significant outflowsof cash. This situation may arise due to circumstances thatAIG may be unable to control, such as a general marketdisruption or an operational problem that affects third partiesor AIG. In addition, this situation may arise due tocircumstances specific to AIG, such as a decline in its creditratings. AIG depends on dividends, distributions and otherpayments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and tofund payments on AIGs obligations, including debtobligations. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limitAIGs ability to transfer funds freely, either to or fromits subsidiaries. In particular, many of AIGssubsidiaries, including AIGs insurance subsidiaries, aresubject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodiesto block or reduce the flow of funds to the parent holdingcompany, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certaincircumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder AIGsability to access funds that AIG may need to make payments onits obligations. See also Item 1. Business Regulation.Some of AIGs investments are relatively illiquid andwould be difficult to sell, or to sell at acceptable prices, ifAIG required cash in amounts greater than its customaryneeds. AIGs investments in certain securities,including certain structured securities, direct privateequities, limited partnerships, hedge funds, mortgage loans,flight equipment, finance receivables and real estate arerelatively illiquid. These asset classes representedapproximately 23 percent of the carrying value of AIGstotal cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2007. Inaddition, the current disruption in the credit markets hasaffected the liquidity of other AIG portfolios 16        AIG2007 Form 10-KTable of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries including the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio.If AIG requires significant amounts of cash on short notice inexcess of normal cash requirements or is required to post orreturn collateral in connection with its investment portfolio,derivative transactions or securities lending activities, thenAIG may have difficulty selling these investments or terminatingthese transactions in a timely manner or may be forced to sellor terminate them for less than what AIG might otherwise havebeen able to, or both. Although AIGFP has no current intent todo so, if AIGFP sells or closes out its derivative transactionsprior to maturity, the effect could be significant to AIGsoverall liquidity.AIGs liquidity may be adversely affected byrequirements to post collateral. Certain of the creditdefault swaps written by AIGFP contain collateral postingrequirements. The amount of collateral required to be posted formost of these transactions is determined based on the value ofthe security or loan referenced in the documentation for thecredit default swap. Continued declines in the values of thesereferenced securities or loans will increase the amount ofcollateral AIGFP must post which could impair AIGsliquidity.   See also Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations  CapitalResources and Liquidity  Liquidity.Investment ConcentrationConcentration of AIGs investment portfolios in anyparticular segment of the economy may have adverse effects.Any concentration of AIGs investment portfolios in anyparticular industry, group of related industries, asset classes,such as residential mortgage-backed securities and otherasset-backed securities, or geographic sector could have anadverse effect on the investment portfolios and consequently onAIGs consolidated results of operations or financialcondition. While AIG seeks to mitigate this risk by having abroadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that havea negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, groupof related industries or geographic region may have a greateradverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent thatthe portfolios are concentrated. Further, AIGs ability tosell assets relating to such particular groups of related assetsmay be limited if other market participants are seeking to sellat the same time.Credit RatingsRatings actions regarding AIG could adversely affectAIGs business and its consolidated results ofoperations. Following AIGs filing with the SEC onFebruary 11, 2008 of a Current Report onForm 8-K regardingthe valuation of AIGFPs super senior credit default swapportfolio and reporting the conclusion by AIGs independentauditors that AIG had a material weakness in internal controlover financial reporting and oversight relating to thisvaluation, the following credit rating actions were taken:      Standard & Poors, a division of The McGraw-Hill    Companies, Inc. (S&P) affirmed its AA    counterparty credit ratings on AIG and its AA+    counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on AIGs    core subsidiaries, but revised the rating outlook to negative.    In addition, S&P revised its rating outlook on ILFCs    corporate credit rating (AA-) to negative. A negative ratings    outlook by S&P indicates that a rating may be lowered, but    is not necessarily a precursor of a ratings change.      Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) changed its rating    outlook for AIG and its subsidiaries that have substantial    exposure to the U.S. subprime mortgage market or whose ratings    rely on significant explicit or implicit support from AIG to    negative. Moodys rates AIG Aa2 and nearly all    of its insurance subsidiaries either Aa1 or    Aa2. A negative ratings outlook by Moodys    indicates that a rating may be lowered, but is not necessarily a    precursor of a ratings change.      Fitch Ratings (Fitch) placed AIGs and its    subsidiaries long-term debt ratings (AA), including ILFC    (A+) and AGF (A+), on Rating Watch Negative. Rating Watch    Negative indicates that a rating has been placed on active    rating watch status. Fitch indicated that it expects to resolve    the Rating Watch after it reviews AIGs 2007 audited    financial statements.      A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best) placed most of its financial    strength and issuer credit ratings on AIGs domestic Life    Insurance and Retirement Services (A++) and Domestic General    Insurance subsidiaries (including Transatlantic) (A+), as well    as AIGs issuer credit rating (AA), under review with    negative implications. A.M. Best indicated that following a    detailed review of AIGs 2007 audited financial statements    and further discussion with AIG management, it will re-evaluate    the under review rating status.   Financial strength and credit ratings by the major ratingsagencies are an important factor in establishing the competitiveposition of insurance companies and other financial institutionsand affect the availability and cost of borrowings. Financialstrength ratings measure an insurance companys ability tomeet its obligations to contract holders and policyholders, helpto maintain public confidence in a companys products,facilitate marketing of products and enhance a companyscompetitive position. Credit ratings measure a companysability to repay its obligations and directly affect the costand availability to that company of unsecured financing.AIGs ratings have historically provided it with acompetitive advantage. However, a ratings downgrade couldadversely affect AIGs business and its consolidatedresults of operations in a number of ways, including:      increasing AIGs interest expense;      reducing AIGFPs ability to compete in the structured    products and derivatives businesses;      reducing the competitive advantage of AIGs insurance    subsidiaries, which may result in reduced product sales;      adversely affecting relationships with agents and sales    representatives;      in the case of a downgrade of AGF or ILFC, increasing their    interest expense and reducing their ability to compete in their    respective businesses; and      triggering the application of a termination provision in certain    of AIGs contracts, principally agreements entered into by    AIGFP and assumed reinsurance contracts entered into by    Transatlantic.AIG 2007Form 10-K        17Table of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries    In the event of a downgrade of AIG, AIG would be required topost additional collateral. It is estimated that, as of theclose of business on February 14, 2008, based on AIGsoutstanding municipal GIAs and financial derivativestransactions as of such date, a further downgrade of AIGslong-term senior debt ratings to Aa3 by Moodys or AA- byS&P would permit counterparties to call for approximately$1.39 billion of additional collateral. Further, additionaldowngrades could result in requirements for substantialadditional collateral, which could have a material effect on howAIG manages its liquidity. For a further discussion ofAIGs credit ratings and the potential effect of postingcollateral on AIGs liquidity, see ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations  Capital Resources andLiquidity  Credit Ratings and  Liquidity.Catastrophe ExposuresThe occurrence of catastrophic events could adversely affectAIGs consolidated financial condition or results ofoperations. The occurrence of events such as hurricanes,earthquakes, pandemic disease, acts of terrorism and othercatastrophes could adversely affect AIGs consolidatedfinancial condition or results of operations, including byexposing AIGs businesses to the following:      widespread claim costs associated with property, workers    compensation, mortality and morbidity claims;      loss resulting from the value of invested assets declining to    below the amount required to meet the policy and contract    liabilities; and      loss resulting from actual policy experience emerging adversely    in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing    related to mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses.ReinsuranceReinsurance may not be available or affordable. AIGsubsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and utilizereinsurance as part of AIGs overall risk managementstrategy. Reinsurance is an important risk management tool tomanage transaction and insurance line risk retention, and tomitigate losses that may arise from catastrophes. Marketconditions beyond AIGs control determine the availabilityand cost of the reinsurance purchased by AIG subsidiaries. Forexample, reinsurance may be more difficult to obtain after ayear with a large number of major catastrophes. Accordingly, AIGmay be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance ormay be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptableterms, in which case AIG would have to accept an increase inexposure risk, reduce the amount of business written by itssubsidiaries or seek alternatives.Reinsurance subjects AIG to the credit risk of its reinsurersand may not be adequate to protect AIG against losses.Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to the AIGsubsidiary to the extent the risk is ceded subject to the termsand conditions of the reinsurance contracts in place, it doesnot relieve the AIG subsidiary of the primary liability to itspolicyholders. Accordingly, AIG bears credit risk with respectto its subsidiaries reinsurers to the extent not mitigatedby collateral or other credit enhancements. A reinsurersinsolvency or inability or refusal to make timely payments underthe terms of its agreements with the AIG subsidiaries could havea material adverse effect on AIGs results of operationsand liquidity. See also Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations  Risk Management  Reinsurance.Adjustments to Life Insurance &Retirement Services Deferred Policy  Acquisition CostsInterest rate fluctuations and other events may require AIGsubsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of deferred policyacquisition costs (DAC) which could adversely affectAIGs consolidated financial condition or results ofoperations. DAC represents the costs that vary with and arerelated primarily to the acquisition of new and renewalinsurance and annuity contracts. When interest rates rise,policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurancepolicies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholdersseek to buy products with perceived higher returns, requiringAIG subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of DAC. To theextent such amortization exceeds surrender or other chargesearned upon surrender and withdrawals of certain life insurancepolicies and annuity contracts, AIGs results of operationscould be negatively affected.   DAC for both insurance-oriented and investment-oriented productsas well as retirement services products is reviewed forrecoverability, which involves estimating the futureprofitability of current business. This review involvessignificant management judgment. If the actual emergence offuture profitability were to be substantially lower thanestimated, AIG could be required to accelerate its DACamortization and such acceleration could adversely affectAIGs results of operations. See also ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations  Critical Accounting Estimates andNotes 1 and 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements.Use of EstimatesIf actual experience differs from managements estimatesused in the preparation of financial statements, AIGsconsolidated results of operations or financial condition couldbe adversely affected. The preparation of financialstatements in conformity with accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United States requires the application ofaccounting policies that often involve a significant degree ofjudgment. AIG considers that its accounting policies that aremost dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions,and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, are thosedescribed in Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates. These accounting estimatesrequire the use of assumptions, some of which are highlyuncertain at the time of estimation. For example, recent marketvolatility and declines in liquidity have made it more difficultto value certain of AIGs invested assets and theobligations and collateral relating to certain financialinstruments issued or held by AIG, such as 18        AIG2007 Form 10-KTable of ContentsAmerican International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries AIGFPs super senior credit default swap portfolio. To theextent actual experience differs from the assumptions used,AIGs consolidated results of operations or financialcondition would be directly affected, perhaps materially.Legal ProceedingsSignificant legal proceedings may adversely affect AIGsresults of operations. AIG is party to numerous legalproceedings and regulatory or governmental investigations. It ispossible that the effect of these unresolved matters could bematerial to AIGs consolidated results of operations for anindividual reporting period. For a discussion of theseunresolved matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.Foreign OperationsForeign operations expose AIG to risks that may affect itsoperations, liquidity and financial condition. AIG providesinsurance, investment and other financial products and servicesto both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countriesand jurisdictions. A substantial portion of AIGs GeneralInsurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance &Retirement Services business is conducted outside the UnitedStates. Operations outside of the United States, particularlythose in developing nations, may be affected by regionaleconomic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates,political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictivegovernment actions, which could also affect other AIG operations.   The degree of regulation and supervision in foreignjurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as itssubsidiaries operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy localregulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authoritiesto AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation.Thus, AIGs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented fromconducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions wherethey currently operate. Adverse actions from any single countrycould adversely affect AIGs results of operations,liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude ofthe event and AIGs net financial exposure at that time inthat country.RegulationAIG is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictionsin which it conducts its businesses. AIGs operationsaround the world are subject to regulation by different types ofregulatory authorities, including insurance, securities,investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the UnitedStates and abroad. AIGs operations have become morediverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope ofregulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. Inparticular, AIGs consumer lending business is subject to abroad array of laws and regulations governing lending practicesand permissible loan terms, and AIG would expect increasedregulatory oversight relating to this business.   The regulatory environment could have a significant effect onAIG and its businesses. Among other things, AIG could be fined,prohibited from engaging in some of its business activities orsubject to limitations or conditions on its business activities.Significant regulatory action against AIG could have materialadverse financial effects, cause significant reputational harmor harm business prospects. New laws or regulations or changesin the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable toclients may also adversely affect AIG and its businesses.A Material WeaknessA material weakness in internal control over financialreporting and oversight relating to the AIGFP valuation of itssuper senior credit default swap portfolio could adverselyaffect the accuracy or timing of future regulatory filings.AIGs management has concluded that a material weaknessrelating to the internal control over financial reporting andoversight relating to the fair value valuation of the AIGFPsuper senior credit default swap portfolio existed as ofDecember 31, 2007. Until remediated, this weakness couldadversely affect the accuracy or timing of future filings withthe SEC and other regulatory authorities. A discussion of thismaterial weakness and AIGs remediation efforts can befound in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Managements Report on Internal Control Over FinancialReporting.Employee Error and MisconductEmployee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect andprevent and may result in significant losses. Losses mayresult from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure todocument transactions properly or to obtain proper internalauthorization or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.   There have been a number of highly publicized cases involvingfraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial servicesindustry in recent years, and AIG runs the risk that employeemisconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter orprevent employee misconduct and the controls that AIG has inplace to prevent and detect this activity may not be effectivein all cases.Aircraft SuppliersThere are limited suppliers of aircraft and engines. Thesupply of jet transport aircraft, which ILFC purchases andleases, is dominated by two airframe manufacturers, Boeing andAirbus, and a limited number of engine manufacturers. As aresult, ILFC is dependent on the manufacturers success inremaining financially stable, producing aircraft and relatedcomponents which meet the airlines demands, both in typeand quantity, and fulfilling their contractual obligations toILFC. Competition between the manufacturers for market share isintense and may lead to instances of deep discounting forcertain aircraft types and could negatively affect ILFCscompetitive pricing"

Casualty Insurance Underwriting andReservesCasualty insurance liabilities are difficult to predict andmay exceed the related reserves for losses and lossexpenses. Although AIG annually reviews the adequacy of theestablished reserve for losses and loss expenses, there can beno assurance that AIGs ultimate loss reserves will notdevelop adversely and materially exceed AIGs current lossreserves. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses andloss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty linesof business, which include excess and umbrella liability,D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workerscompensation, general liability, products liability and relatedclasses, as well as for asbestos and environmental exposures.Generally, actual historical loss development factors are usedto project future loss development. However, there can be noassurance that future loss development patterns will be the sameas in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends orin loss development factors might not be discernible for anextended period of time subsequent to the recording of theinitial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus,there is the potential for reserves with respect to a number ofyears to be significantly affected by changes in loss costtrends or loss development factors that were relied upon insetting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or lossdevelopment factors could be attributable to changes ininflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social oreconomic phenomena affecting claims.

As a result of thesettlements discussed below under Item 3. LegalProceedings, AIG recorded an after-tax charge of approximately$1.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. AIG is partyto numerous other legal proceedings and regulatoryinvestigations. It is possible that the effect of the unresolvedmatters could be material to AIGs consolidated results ofoperations for an individual reporting period. For a discussionof these unresolved matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.RegulationAIG is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictionsin which it conducts its businesses. AIGs operationsaround the world are subject to regulation by different types ofregulatory authorities, including insurance, securities,investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the UnitedStates and abroad.

New laws or regulations or changesin the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable toclients may also adversely affect AIG and its businesses.Foreign OperationsForeign operations expose AIG to risks that may affect itsoperations, liquidity and financial condition. AIG providesinsurance and investment products and services to bothbusinesses and individuals in more than 130 countries andjurisdictions. A substantial portion of AIGs GeneralInsurance business and a majority of its LifeInsurance & Retirement Services businesses areconducted outside the United States. Operations outside of theUnited States may be affected by regional economic downturns,changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval,nationalization and other restrictive government actions, whichcould also affect other AIG operations.   The degree of regulation and supervision in foreignjurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as theunderwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, mustsatisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued byforeign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject tomodification and revocation. Thus, AIGs insurancesubsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future businessin certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.AIGs international operations include operations invarious developing nations. Both current and future foreignoperations could be adversely affected by unfavorable politicaldevelopments including tax changes, regulatory restrictions andnationalization of AIGs operations without compensation.Adverse actions from any one country may adversely affectAIGs results of operations, liquidity and financialcondition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIGsnet financial exposure at that time in that country.Information TechnologyA failure in AIGs operational systems or infrastructureor those of third parties could disrupt business, damageAIGs reputation and cause losses. AIGsoperations rely on the secure processing, storage andtransmission of confidential and other information in itscomputer systems and networks. AIGs business depends oneffective information systems and the integrity and timelinessof the data it uses to run its business. AIGs ability toadequately price its products and services, establish reserves,provide effective and efficient service to its customers, and totimely and accurately report its financial results also dependssignificantly on the integrity of the data in its informationsystems. Although AIG takes protective measures and endeavors tomodify them as circumstances warrant, its computer systems,software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access,computer viruses or other malicious code and other events thatcould have security consequences. If one or more of such eventsoccur, this potentially could jeopardize AIGs or itsclients or counterparties confidential and otherinformation processed and stored in, and transmitted through,its computer systems and networks, or otherwise causeinterruptions or malfunctions in AIGs, its clients,its counterparties or third parties operations,which could result in significant losses or reputational damage.AIG may be required to expend significant additional resourcesto modify its protective measures or to investigate andremediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and AIG may besubject to litigation and financial losses that are either notinsured against or not fully covered by insurance maintained.   Despite the contingency plans and facilities AIG has in place,its ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by adisruption of the infrastructure that supports AIGsbusiness in the communities in which it is located. This mayinclude a disruption involving electrical, communications,transportation or other services used by AIG. These disruptionsmay occur, for example, as a result of events that affect onlythe buildings occupied by AIG or as a result of events16       AIG 2006 Form 10-K American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries with a broader effect on the cities where those buildings arelocated. If a disruption occurs in one location and AIGsemployees in that location are unable to occupy its offices andconduct business or communicate with or travel to otherlocations, AIGs ability to service and interact with itsclients may suffer and it may not be able to successfullyimplement contingency plans that depend on communication ortravel.AIGs Credit RatingsFinancial strength and credit ratings by major ratingsagencies are an important factor in establishing the competitiveposition of insurance companies and other financial institutionsand affect the availability and cost of borrowings. Anyratings downgrade may lessen AIGs ability to compete incertain businesses and may increase AIGs interest expense.Financial strength ratings measure an insurance companysability to meet its obligations to contract holders andpolicyholders, help to maintain public confidence in acompanys products, facilitate marketing of products andenhance a companys competitive position. Credit ratingsmeasure a companys ability to repay its obligations anddirectly affect the cost and availability to that company ofunsecured financing. Historically, AIGs credit andfinancial strength ratings have provided AIG a competitiveadvantage.   From March through June of 2005, the major rating agenciesdowngraded the ratings of AIG and its insurance subsidiaries ina series of actions. Many of the ratings were put on negativewatch or negative outlook, which indicates a potentialdowngrade. Since then, however, the agencies have affirmed theratings of AIG and all of its subsidiaries with a stableoutlook, which indicates that the rating is not likely to changein the near term, except that S&P maintains a negativeoutlook on Transatlantic and on the senior long-term debt ratingof ILFC.   A downgrade of the credit or financial strength ratings of AIGor its subsidiaries could adversely affect AIGs businessand its consolidated results of operations in a number of ways,including:      increasing AIGs interest expense;      reducing AIGFPs ability to compete in the structured    products and derivatives businesses;      reducing the competitive advantage of AIGs insurance    subsidiaries, which may result in reduced product sales and/or    lower prices;      adversely affecting relationships with agents and sales    representatives; and      in the case of a downgrade of AGF or ILFC, increasing their    interest expense and reducing their ability to compete in their    respective businesses.   As a result of the downgrades in 2005 discussed above, AIG wasrequired to post approximately $1.16 billion of collateralwith counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment contractsand financial derivatives transactions. In the event of afurther downgrade, AIG would be required to post additionalcollateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of business onFebruary 15, 2007, based on AIGs outstandingmunicipal GIAs and financial derivatives transactions as of suchdate, a further downgrade of AIGs long-term senior debtratings to Aa3 by Moodys or AA- by S&P would permitcounterparties to call for approximately $864 million ofadditional collateral. Further, additional downgrades couldresult in requirements for substantial additional collateral,which could have a material effect on how AIG manages itsliquidity. For a further discussion of AIGs credit ratingsand the potential effect of posting collateral on AIGsliquidity, see Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Resources and Liquidity  Credit Ratingsand  Liquidity.LiquidityLiquidity risk represents the potential inability of AIG tomeet all payment obligations when they become due.AIGs liquidity could be impaired by an inability to accessthe capital markets or by unforeseen significant outflows ofcash. This situation may arise due to circumstances that AIG maybe unable to control, such as a general market disruption or anoperational problem that affects third parties or AIG. AIGdepends on dividends, distributions and other payments from itssubsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund payments onAIGs obligations, including debt obligations. Regulatoryand other legal restrictions may limit AIGs ability totransfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries. Inparticular, many of AIGs subsidiaries, includingAIGs insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws andregulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reducethe flow of funds to the parent holding company, or thatprohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances.These laws and regulations may hinder AIGs ability toaccess funds that AIG may need to make payments on itsobligations. See also Item 1. Business Regulation.Some of AIGs investments are relatively illiquid.AIGs investments in certain fixed income investments,certain structured securities, direct private equities, limitedpartnerships, hedge funds and real estate are relativelyilliquid. These asset classes represented nine percent ofthe carrying value of AIGs total cash and invested assetsas of December 31, 2006. If AIG requires significantamounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cashrequirements, AIG may have difficulty selling these investmentsin a timely manner or be forced to sell them for less than whatAIG might otherwise have been able to, or both.Concentration of AIGs investment portfolios in anyparticular segment of the economy may have adverse effects.The concentration of AIGs investment portfolios in anyparticular industry, group of related industries or geographicsector could have an adverse effect on the investment portfoliosand consequently on AIGs results of operations andfinancial position. While AIG seeks to mitigate this risk byhaving a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developmentsthat have a negative effect on any particular industry, group ofrelated industries or geographic region may have a greateradverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent thatthe portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified.Further, AIGs ability to sell assets relating to suchparticular industry, group of related industries or geographicregion may be limited if other market participants are seekingto sell at the same time.Form 10-K 2006 AIG        17 American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries    See also Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations  CapitalResources and Liquidity  Liquidity.The Relationships Between AIG and  the Starr EntitiesThe relationships between AIG and the Starr entities may takean extended period of time to unwind and/or resolve, and theconsequences of such resolution are uncertain. During 2006,AIG unwound and resolved its most significant relationships withC.V. Starr & Co, Inc. (Starr) and began unwinding andresolving various relationships with Starr InternationalCompany, Inc. (SICO). AIG cannot predict what its futurerelationship with Starr and SICO will be.   The agency relationships between AIG subsidiaries and Starr havebeen terminated and litigation with Starr has been resolved, butthere can be no assurance that AIG will compete successfully forthe business previously produced by the Starr agencies. InJanuary 2006, Starr announced that it had completed its tenderoffers to purchase interests in Starr and that all eligibleshareholders had tendered their shares. As a result ofcompletion of the tender offers, no AIG executive currentlyholds any Starr interest.   AIG has entered into agreements pursuant to which AIG agrees,subject to certain conditions, to assure AIGs currentemployees that all payments are made under a series of two-yearDeferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans provided bySICO (SICO Plans). For a further discussion of the SICO plans,see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that AIG will be able toeffectively address the consequences for its executives of theunwinding of their participation in the SICO plans and programs.Finally, litigation between AIG and SICO remains pending, andthe timing, terms and effect on AIG of any resolution cannotcurrently be predicted. See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings.Employee Error and MisconductEmployee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect andprevent and may result in significant losses. Losses mayresult from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure todocument transactions properly or to obtain proper internalauthorization or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.   There have been a number of highly publicized cases involvingfraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial servicesindustry in recent years, and AIG runs the risk that employeemisconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter orprevent employee misconduct and the precautions AIG takes toprevent and detect this activity may not be effective in allcases.Aircraft SuppliersThere are limited suppliers of aircraft and engines. Thesupply of jet transport aircraft, which ILFC purchases andleases, is dominated by two airframe manufacturers, Boeing andAirbus, and a limited number of engine manufacturers. As aresult, ILFC is dependent on the manufacturers success inremaining financially stable, producing aircraft and relatedcomponents which meet the airlines demands, both in typeand quantity, and fulfilling their contractual obligations toILFC. Competition between the manufacturers for market share isintense and may lead to instances of deep discounting forcertain aircraft types and may negatively affect ILFCscompetitive pricing"
