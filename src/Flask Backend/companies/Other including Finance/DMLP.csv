6,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2024-02-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:   ●  the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;    ●  the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;    ●  political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;    ●  the price and level of foreign imports;    ●  the level of consumer demand;    ●  the price and availability of alternative fuels;    ●  the availability of pipeline capacity;    ●  weather conditions;    ●  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and    ●  the overall economic environment.  Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders. We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the Operating Partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The Operating Partnership is unable to influence the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations, and general industry and economic conditions. The Operating Partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our General Partner, through the Operating Partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The Operating Partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, most of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Most of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others.       5     Table of Contents Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. All of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of operating cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our General Partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts (such as limiting acquisitions to acquisitions of NPIs and royalty interests) to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our General Partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration. Acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Our operators’ failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in the deferral of prospective drilling opportunities. In addition, our ORRIs may terminate if the underlying acreage is not drilled before the expiration of the applicable lease or if the lease otherwise terminates. Leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. In addition, even if production or drilling is established during such primary term, if production or drilling ceases on the leased property, the lease typically terminates, subject to certain exceptions. Any reduction in our operators’ drilling programs, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of equipment, services, or supplies, could result in the expiration of existing leases. If the lease governing any of our mineral interests expires or terminates, all development rights typically revert back to us, and we may seek new lessees to explore and develop such mineral interests or in some states remain unleased. If the lease underlying any of our ORRIs expires or terminates, our ORRIs that are derived from such lease will also terminate. Any such expirations or terminations of our leases or our ORRIs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. If our operators suspend our right to receive royalty payments due to title or other issues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.  Our business depends, in part, on acquisitions which contribute to the growth of our reserves, production and cash generated from operations. In connection with these acquisitions, we are conveyed record title to mineral and royalty interests. Due to such changes in ownership of mineral interests, the operator of the underlying property has the right, at such operator’s discretion, to investigate and verify the title and ownership of mineral and royalty interests with respect to the properties it operates. If any title or ownership issues are not resolved to its reasonable satisfaction in accordance with customary industry standards, the operator has the right to suspend payment of the related royalty. If an operator of our properties is not satisfied with the documentation we provide to validate our ownership, such operator may suspend our royalty payment until such issues are resolved, at which time we would receive the full royalty payment which we would have otherwise received if not for the payment being suspended, without interest. Certain of our operators impose burdensome documentation requirements for title transfer and may keep royalty payments in suspense for significant periods of time. During the time that an operator puts our assets in pay suspense, we would not receive the applicable mineral or royalty payment owed to us from sales of the underlying oil or natural gas related to such mineral or royalty interest. If a significant amount of our royalty interests are placed in suspense, our results of operations and cash flow may be materially affected. Title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.  In our discretion, we may elect not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to our royalty and mineral interests. In such cases, we would rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before acquiring a specific royalty or mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can have a significant adverse effect on the value of an interest and can further materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may experience delays in received royalty payments and be unable to replace operators that do not make required royalty payments, and we may not be able to terminate our leases with defaulting lessees if any of the operators on those leases declare bankruptcy.  We may experience delays in receiving royalty payments from our operators, including as a result of delayed division orders received by our operators. Typically, the failure of an operator to make royalty payments to which we are entitled, gives us the right to terminate the lease, repossess the property and enforce payment obligations under the lease. If we repossessed any of our properties, we would seek a replacement operator. However, we cannot guarantee finding a suitable replacement operator in such a circumstance and if we did, we might not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the outgoing operator could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), in which case our right to enforce or terminate the lease for any defaults, including non-payment, may be substantially delayed or otherwise at risk. In general, in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, the bankrupt operator would have an extended period of time to decide whether to ultimately reject or assume the lease, which could significantly delay or prevent the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to a replacement operator. In the event that an operator rejects the lease, our ability to collect amounts owed to us would be substantially delayed, and our ultimate recovery may be only a fraction of the amount owed or nothing. In addition, if we are able to enter into a new lease with a new operator, there is no guarantee that such replacement operator will achieve the same levels of production or sell oil or natural gas at the same price as the operator it replaced. We do not currently plan to enter into hedging arrangements with respect to the oil and natural gas production from our properties, and we will be exposed to the impact of decreases in the price of oil and natural gas.  We do not currently plan to enter into hedging arrangements to establish, in advance, a price for the sale of the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. As a result, although we may realize the benefit of any short-term increase in the price of oil and natural gas, we will not be protected against decreases in the price of oil and natural gas or prolonged periods of low commodity prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and cash available for distribution. If we enter into hedging arrangements in the future, it may limit our ability to realize the benefit of rising prices and may result in hedging losses.       6     Table of Contents Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our and our operators’ ability to succeed.  The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and the operators of our properties compete with other companies that may have greater resources or greater access to capital. Many of these companies explore for and produce oil and natural gas, carry on midstream and refining operations, and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods when market prices of oil and natural gas are low. Our operators’ larger competitors may be able to better address the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than our operators can, which could adversely affect our operators’ competitive position. Our operators may have access to fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our operators’ industry and may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. Furthermore, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced recent consolidation amongst some operators, which has resulted in certain instances of combined companies with larger resources. Such combined companies may compete against our operators or, in the case of consolidation amongst our operators, may choose to focus their operations on areas outside of our properties. In addition, we cannot guarantee our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future as this will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The Operating Partnership may participate in drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:   ●  pressure or irregularities in formations;    ●  equipment failures or accidents;    ●  unexpected drilling conditions;    ●  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;    ●  adverse weather conditions; and    ●  disputes with drill-site owners.  Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests or cash proceeds of a securities offering. Because of the limitations on our use of operating cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate operating cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions by first selling our securities to raise cash or by issuing our limited partnership interests. However, we may be unable to sell our securities in sufficient quantities and for sufficient consideration to provide adequate consideration to fund an acquisition, and sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our General Partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our General Partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our General Partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives.       7     Table of Contents A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are properties located in the Bakken region and Permian Basin. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment, services, or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the Operating Partnership. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the Operating Partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such full insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. Regulators have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from our properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future. Cyber incidents or attacks targeting our systems and infrastructure used by the oil and natural gas industry may adversely impact our operations, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection of our data, our business may be adversely impacted. We and our operators increasingly rely on information technology systems to operate our respective businesses, and the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies in exploration, development, production, and processing activities. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Our technologies, systems, networks, including third party software, cloud services and other internally and externally hosted hardware and software platforms, and those of the operators of our properties, vendors, suppliers, and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business activities. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for some period of time. While we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate exposure to such risk, cyber incidents and attacks are evolving and unpredictable. Our information technology systems and any insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. It is possible that our business, finances, systems and assets could be compromised in a cyber attack. The Partnership may be adversely affected by price volatility in the oil and natural gas markets. Historically, there has been price volatility in the oil and natural gas markets, which have been impacted by a number of factors, including actions by oil producing nations. For example, after OPEC and a group of oil producing nations led by Russia failed in March 2020 to agree on oil production cuts, Saudi Arabia announced that it would cut oil prices and increase production, leading to a sharp decline in oil and natural gas prices. While OPEC, Russia and other oil producing countries reached an agreement in April 2020 to reduce production levels, and U.S. production declined, oil prices remained lower than in previous years on account of an oversupply of oil and natural gas, with a simultaneous decrease in demand as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Thereafter, in 2021, oil and natural gas prices significantly rebounded. Although we continue to see sustained improvements in pricing, on account of a number of factors, the oil and natural gas markets remain subject to price volatility, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash distributions in periods of lower prices. During periods of substantial declines in prices, such as in 2020, oil and natural gas operators on our properties may suspend drilling programs, which would impact our revenues and operating income. In the event that any wells on our properties are shut-in, restarting wells may require significant costs from our operators, and we cannot guarantee that they would be able to restart at the same level. Moreover, due to the extremely volatile market conditions, we are unable to predict the degree or duration of any adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and other risks in our industry may be enhanced by such conditions.       8     Table of Contents Continuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in federal monetary policy may result in increases to the costs of the goods, services and labor used by our operators, which could cause their capital expenditures and operating costs to rise and may delay or restrict their exploration and development activities. The rate of inflation in the U.S. has been steadily increasing since 2021 and through 2022. These inflationary pressures may result in increases to the costs of the goods, services and labor used by our operators, which could cause their capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Sustained levels of high inflation have likewise caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates, which could have the effects of raising the cost of capital and depressing economic growth, either of which, or the combination thereof, could hurt the financial and operating results of our operators’ businesses. If our operators are unable to secure the goods, services and labor necessary for their operations at reasonable costs, their exploration and development activities could be delayed or restricted, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. Regulatory and Environmental Risk Factors
 Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because of the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and natural gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required), and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain materials that are commonly used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are considered to be hazardous substances under CERCLA. Responsible persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site, regardless of whether the disposal of hazardous substances was lawful at the time of the disposal. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, damages to natural resources and certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of these costs. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and many other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or natural gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority. The Federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements, such as emissions controls. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) continues to develop New Source Performance standards for oil and natural gas facilities. On May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, on August 13, 2020, in response to an executive order by former President Trump, the EPA amended the New Source Performance standards to ease regulatory burdens, including rescinding standards applicable to transmission or storage segments and eliminating methane requirements altogether. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint resolution of Congress disapproving the 2020 amendments, with the exception of some technical changes, thereby reinstating the prior standards. The EPA expects owners and operators of regulated sources to take “immediate steps” to comply with these standards. Additionally, on December 2, 2023, the EPA announced a final rule that would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry by requiring increased monitoring of fugitive emissions, imposing new requirements for pneumatic controllers and tank batteries, and prohibiting venting of natural gas in certain situations. Additionally, on April 17, 2023, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to issue a proposed rule by December 10, 2024 that either revises its emission standards for hazardous air pollutants from oil and natural gas production activities or determines that no revision is necessary. Federal changes will affect state air permitting programs in states that administer the federal CAA under a delegation of authority, including states in which we have operations. These new standards, to the extent implemented, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to our operators to comply with such requirements with any certainty.       9     Table of Contents The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act” or “CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“USACOE”). On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the USACOE jointly promulgated a final rule expanding the scope of “Waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”), which would have made additional waters subject to the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. However, on October 22, 2019, the agencies published a final rule to repeal the 2015 WOTUS rule, and then, on April 21, 2020, the EPA and the USACOE published a final rule replacing the 2015 rule and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the CWA. On August 30, 2021, a federal court struck down the replacement rule and, on January 18, 2023, the EPA and the USACOE published a final rule that would restore water protections that were in place prior to 2015. However, on May 25, 2023, the Supreme Court issued an opinion substantially narrowing the scope of “waters of the United States” protected under the CWA. On September 8, 2023, the EPA and the USACOE published a final rule conforming their regulations to the decision. These recent actions have provided some clarity. To the extent the EPA and the USACOE broadly interpret their jurisdiction and expand the range of properties subject to the CWA’s jurisdiction, our operators could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas, which could cause delays in development and/or increase the cost of development and operation of those properties. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (“SPCC”) regulations promulgated under the CWA and later amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 impose obligations and liabilities related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills into or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities that store oil in more than threshold quantities, the release of which could reasonably be expected to reach jurisdictional waters, must develop, implement, and maintain SPCC Plans. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Various federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and analogous state laws, restrict activities that may adversely affect listed endangered or threatened species or their habitat. If endangered or threatened species are located on our properties, operations on those properties could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Also, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access, development or operations (including prevent oil and natural gas exploration or production). Additionally, the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as endangered or threatened could result in the imposition of restrictions on our operators and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business. Oil and natural gas operations are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes and their implementing regulations. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, the general duty clause and Risk Management Planning regulations promulgated under section 112(r) of the CAA and similar state statutes may require disclosure of information about hazardous materials used, produced or otherwise managed during operation. These laws also require the development of risk management plans for certain facilities to prevent accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of such releases should they occur. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing laws or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. Hydraulic fracturing is an important, common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as “Class II” Underground Injection Control wells under the SDWA. Future federal laws or regulations could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation or regulation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In addition, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. Also, on November 18, 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and natural gas operations on federal and Indian lands. On March 28, 2017, former President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rules and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule. A coalition of environmentalists, tribal advocates and the State of California filed lawsuits challenging the rule rescission. Also, on September 28, 2018, the BLM published a final rule to revise the 2016 methane rule; however, a federal court struck down the scaled-back rule on July 15, 2020, and shortly thereafter, on October 8, 2020, another federal court struck down the 2016 methane rule. On November 28, 2022, the BLM announced a proposed replacement rule to reduce the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring and leaks during oil and gas production activities on federal and Indian lands, which would require the use of upgraded equipment in some cases and would place time and volume limits on royalty-free flaring. Also, on July 24, 2023, the BLM published a proposed rule to update its oil and gas leasing regulations, which would increase bonding requirements and raise royalty rates. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the above rules will be implemented or if new requirements will be adopted. Each of these regulations, to the extent that they are reinstated or modified, may result in additional levels of regulation or complexity that could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase costs of compliance.       10     Table of Contents Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In response to a 2014 ballot initiative by the voters of the City of Denton, Texas banning hydraulic fracturing, the Texas legislature enacted a statute preempting local government regulation of oil and natural gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing. In other states, however, local governments may retain the ability to directly or indirectly regulate hydraulic fracturing. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties to comply with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells. Some states have become concerned about the connection between hydraulic fracturing-related activities, particularly the injection or disposal of produced water, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and they have adopted or are considering additional regulations regarding such activities. Changes in regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect the ability of the operators of the Royalty Properties and the operators of the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs to dispose of produced water and ultimately increase the cost of operation of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs or delay production schedules. Certain state agencies, including those in Texas and Oklahoma, have implemented regulations authorizing the imposition of certain limitations on existing wells if seismic activity increases in the area of an injection well, including a temporary injection ban. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporations Commission (“OCC”) has implemented a variety of measures, including the adoption of the National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications and may restrict operations at existing wells. Beginning in 2013, the OCC has ordered the reduction of disposal volumes into the Arbuckle formation. More recently, the OCC directed the shut in of a number of disposal wells due to increased earthquake activity in the Arbuckle formation and imposed further disposal well volume reductions in the Covington, Crescent, Enid, and Edmond areas. The Texas Railroad Commission has also implemented measures to assess the potential for seismic activity in the vicinity of disposal wells, and it has restricted and indefinitely suspended disposal well activities in some cases. Moreover, vigorous public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production continues and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas. Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies have also evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for our operators to perform fracturing and increase their costs of compliance and doing business. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. In recent years, federal, state, and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) include billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced biofuels and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration. The EPA has proposed ambitious rules to reduce harmful air pollutant emissions, including GHGs, from light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles beginning in model year 2027. These incentives and regulations could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, oil and natural gas and adversely impact our business. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of GHGs through a methane emissions charge. Specifically, the IRA amends the Clean Air Act to impose a fee on the emission of methane that exceeds an applicable waste emissions threshold from sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA, including sources in the offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting source categories. The methane emissions charge would start in calendar year 2024 at $900 per ton of methane, increase to $1,200 in 2025 and be set at $1,500 for 2026 and each year after. Calculation of the fee is based on certain thresholds established in the IRA. On January 12, 2024, the EPA announced a proposed rule to implement the methane emissions charge. The methane emissions charge could increase our operators’ costs, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. The EPA has also finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and almost half of the states have taken measures to reduce GHG emissions primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. In addition, states have imposed increasingly stringent requirements related to the venting or flaring of natural gas during oil and natural gas operations. In addition, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding GHG reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”). The U.S. was among approximately 195 nations that signed an international accord in December 2015, the so called Paris Agreement, which became effective on November 4, 2016, with the objective of limiting GHG emissions. On April 21, 2021, the United States announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing its GHG emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, in connection with Glasgow Climate Pact, the United States and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce GHG emissions, including reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels. More than 150 countries have now signed on to this pledge. Most recently, at the 28th Conference of the Parties in the United Arab Emirates, world leaders agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner and to triple renewables and double energy efficiency globally by 2030. Many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international climate commitments. Although these international commitments are not directly binding on companies, additional GHG reduction regulatory requirements may be issued in an effort to help meet the U.S. commitments under the Paris Agreement. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may adopt additional climate change legislation, or whether EPA may promulgate additional regulation of GHGs from the oil and natural gas industry, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties.       11     Table of Contents It should also be noted that, recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. In addition, spurred by increasing concerns regarding climate change, the oil and natural gas industry faces growing demand for corporate transparency and a demonstrated commitment to sustainability goals. Environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) goals and programs, which typically include extralegal targets related to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance, have become an increasing focus of investors and shareholders across the industry. While reporting on ESG metrics remains voluntary, access to capital and investors is likely to favor companies with robust ESG programs in place. In March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks and other information. To the extent this rule is finalized as proposed, the Partnership, our operators and/or our customers could incur increased costs related to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related information. Enhanced climate disclosure requirements could also accelerate any trend by certain stakeholders and capital providers to restrict or seek more stringent conditions with respect to their financing of certain carbon intensive sectors. Ultimately, these initiatives could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Finally, climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operators’ activities and increase their costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. The outcome of pending litigation related to the Dakota Access Pipeline and any related executive orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash distributions. In connection with ongoing litigation initiated in February 2017 by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe contesting the validity of the process used by the USACOE to permit the Dakota Access Pipeline, on July 6, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the “Court”) issued an order vacating the USACOE’s easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and requiring that the pipeline be shut down by August 5, 2020. Dakota Access, LLC and the USACOE appealed the decision. On July 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals granted a temporary administrative stay, and on January 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals affirmed that part of the lower court decision vacating the USACOE’s easement while it prepares a new environmental impact statement, but reversed the lower court’s order to shut down the pipeline. Since then, both the Biden Administration and the Court have declined to shut down the pipeline, and on June 22, 2021, the Court dismissed the subject lawsuit. The Court noted, however, that future challenges were possible depending on the outcome of the ongoing environmental study, which the USACOE issued in draft form on September 8, 2023. Accordingly, the continued operation of Dakota Access Pipeline in the future is uncertain. While this litigation does not directly impact our operations, we derive a significant amount of revenue from the Royalty Properties and NPIs we hold in the Bakken region, the region for which the Dakota Access Pipeline is intended to be a key pipeline. The outcome of this litigation may have a material adverse effect on our Royalty and NPI revenues derived from the Bakken region based on the timing of future development of wells on, or production of oil and natural gas from, or the method and cost of transportation related to the production on the properties. We have no control over the operation of such properties. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our General Partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the General Partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our General Partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our General Partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our General Partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder Schedule K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder Schedule K-1 tax statements will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our General Partner, and their ability to remove our General Partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our General Partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our General Partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our General Partner on an annual or any other basis.       12     Table of Contents Our General Partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our General Partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our General Partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our General Partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our General Partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our General Partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our General Partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our General Partner relating to their interests in our General Partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our General Partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the General Partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our General Partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our General Partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our General Partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of General Partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our General Partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our General Partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our General Partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our General Partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our General Partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 40% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our General Partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our General Partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the General Partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our General Partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Executive Officer, Bradley J. Ehrman, and Chief Financial Officer, Leslie A. Moriyama. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various U.S. federal income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain.       13     Table of Contents Tax Risk Factors
 The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and General Partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority. In 2020, we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI, including the previously aggregated Maecenas NPI, Bradley NPI, Republic NPI, and Spinnaker NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2020. We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a ""qualifying income"" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. However, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other matter affecting us. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21%, and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Several states have subjected, or are evaluating ways to subject, partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation or the assessment of a material amount of entity-level taxation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, the President and members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships. Under current law, we believe that our royalty income is qualifying income for purposes of Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). If the current law remains effective in its current form, we believe we will continue to be able to meet the qualifying income requirement. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be changes to the federal income tax laws or the Treasury Department's interpretation of the qualifying income rules in a manner that could impact our ability to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in the future. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or otherwise adversely affect us. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. The recently enacted 20% deduction for certain pass-through income may not be available for our unitholders’ allocable share of our net income, in which case our unitholders’ tax liability with respect to ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or before December 31, 2025, an individual taxpayer may generally claim a deduction in the amount of 20% of its allocable share of certain publicly traded partnership income, including generally, among other items, the net amount of its items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a publicly traded partnership’s U.S. trade or business. Because we own only non-operated, passive mineral and royalty interests, most or all of the income that we now generate, or will generate in the future, may not be “qualifying publicly traded partnership income” eligible for the 20% deduction. If the deduction is not available, our unitholders’ tax liability from ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. We urge our unitholders to consult with their tax advisors regarding the availability of the 20% deduction on any income allocated from us. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final Treasury regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if the IRS challenges our method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction may be reallocated among our unitholders and our General Partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our General Partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.       14     Table of Contents Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our General Partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the Operating Partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the Operating Partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the Operating Partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if the unitholder qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, the unitholder generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us generally is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us generally will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by the applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our General Partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units.       15     Table of Contents The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors, and so we cannot predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders will be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on their share of taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if the unitholder lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, the unitholder may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where the unitholder resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We generally will have the ability to shift any such tax liability (including any applicable penalties and interest) to our General Partner and our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. If we are unable to have our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the economic burden resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. Our unitholders may be subject to withholding tax upon transfers of their common units. If a unitholder sells or otherwise disposes of a common unit on or after January 1, 2023, the transferee generally will be required to withhold 10% of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person. However, final regulations issued by the Treasury Department on the application of these rules to transfers of certain publicly traded partnership interests, including our common units, provide that the obligation to withhold on a transfer of interests in a publicly traded partnership that is effected through a broker is imposed on the transferor’s broker (instead of the transferee), and the “amount realized” on such a transfer will generally be the amount of gross proceeds paid to the broker effecting the applicable transfer on behalf of the transferor (and thus determined without regard to any decrease in that transferor’s share of the publicly traded partnership's liabilities). Prospective foreign unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of these rules on an investment in our common units.       16     Table of Contents General Risk Factors
 Public health threats could have an adverse effect on our Partnership, our cash flow and our industry. Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have been occurring in across the world, including the United States, could adversely impact our Partnership, drilling activities on our properties and the global economy. In particular, the outbreak starting in 2020 of a coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in quarantines, restrictions on travel and a decrease in economic activity across the world, which then resulted in a decrease in demand for hydrocarbons. At its height, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative effect on the global economy, supply chains and labor force participation, and created significant volatility in financial markets. Although the effects of the pandemic during 2022 were not as significant as prior years, new variants continued to cause waves of COVID-19 cases around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing variants may continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for hydrocarbons and the prices at which they are sold, which may impact our revenues and operating income, our cash distributions and our business generally. It is impossible to predict the effect of the continued spread, or fear of continued spread, of COVID-19 and its ongoing variants globally. No assurance can be given that public health threats will not have a material adverse effect, and that any further spread of COVID-19 and its ongoing variants will not have a material adverse effect, on our business, operations and financial results. The Partnership may be adversely affected by the international economic instability caused by ongoing global conflicts. During 2022 and 2023, multiple global military conflicts arose, causing instability in the international economy which may continue into 2024. Although the length, impact and outcome of these military conflicts are highly unpredictable, an escalation or expansion of any of these conflicts could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including disruptions to the oil and gas industry, significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability and other material and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions. It is not possible at this time to predict or determine the ultimate consequences of these ongoing conflicts. We will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will continue to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices. As a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, particularly since we are now a large accelerated filer and are no longer a smaller reporting company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased, and will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new or changing laws, regulations, and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. Further, failure to comply with these laws, regulations and standards may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members to serve on our board of directors or committees or as members of senior management. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in future uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.

9,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2023-02-23,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:   ●  the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;    ●  the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;    ●  political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;    ●  the price and level of foreign imports;    ●  the level of consumer demand;    ●  the price and availability of alternative fuels;    ●  the availability of pipeline capacity;    ●  weather conditions;    ●  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and    ●  the overall economic environment.  Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders. We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the Operating Partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The Operating Partnership is unable to influence the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations, and general industry and economic conditions. The Operating Partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our General Partner, through the Operating Partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The Operating Partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, most of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Most of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others.      5   Table of Contents Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. All of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of operating cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our General Partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our General Partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration. Acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Our operators’ failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in the deferral of prospective drilling opportunities. In addition, our ORRIs may terminate if the underlying acreage is not drilled before the expiration of the applicable lease or if the lease otherwise terminates. Leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. In addition, even if production or drilling is established during such primary term, if production or drilling ceases on the leased property, the lease typically terminates, subject to certain exceptions. Any reduction in our operators’ drilling programs, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of equipment, services, or supplies, could result in the expiration of existing leases. If the lease governing any of our mineral interests expires or terminates, all development rights typically revert back to us, and we may seek new lessees to explore and develop such mineral interests or in some states remain unleased. If the lease underlying any of our ORRIs expires or terminates, our ORRIs that are derived from such lease will also terminate. Any such expirations or terminations of our leases or our ORRIs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. If our operators suspend our right to receive royalty payments due to title or other issues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.  Our business depends, in part, on acquisitions which contribute to the growth of our reserves, production and cash generated from operations. In connection with these acquisitions, we are conveyed record title to mineral and royalty interests. Due to such changes in ownership of mineral interests, the operator of the underlying property has the right, at such operator’s discretion, to investigate and verify the title and ownership of mineral and royalty interests with respect to the properties it operates. If any title or ownership issues are not resolved to its reasonable satisfaction in accordance with customary industry standards, the operator has the right to suspend payment of the related royalty. If an operator of our properties is not satisfied with the documentation we provide to validate our ownership, such operator may suspend our royalty payment until such issues are resolved, at which time we would receive the full royalty payment which we would have otherwise received if not for the payment being suspended, without interest. Certain of our operators impose burdensome documentation requirements for title transfer and may keep royalty payments in suspense for significant periods of time. During the time that an operator puts our assets in pay suspense, we would not receive the applicable mineral or royalty payment owed to us from sales of the underlying oil or natural gas related to such mineral or royalty interest. If a significant amount of our royalty interests are placed in suspense, our results of operations and cash flow may be materially affected. Title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.  In our discretion, we may elect not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to our royalty and mineral interests. In such cases, we would rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before acquiring a specific royalty or mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can have a significant adverse effect on the value of an interest and can further materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may experience delays in received royalty payments and be unable to replace operators that do not make required royalty payments, and we may not be able to terminate our leases with defaulting lessees if any of the operators on those leases declare bankruptcy.  We may experience delays in receiving royalty payments from our operators, including as a result of delayed division orders received by our operators. Typically, the failure of an operator to make royalty payments to which we are entitled, gives us the right to terminate the lease, repossess the property and enforce payment obligations under the lease. If we repossessed any of our properties, we would seek a replacement operator. However, we cannot guarantee finding a suitable replacement operator in such a circumstance and if we did, we might not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the outgoing operator could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), in which case our right to enforce or terminate the lease for any defaults, including non-payment, may be substantially delayed or otherwise at risk. In general, in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, the bankrupt operator would have an extended period of time to decide whether to ultimately reject or assume the lease, which could significantly delay or prevent the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to a replacement operator. In the event that an operator rejects the lease, our ability to collect amounts owed to us would be substantially delayed, and our ultimate recovery may be only a fraction of the amount owed or nothing. In addition, if we are able to enter into a new lease with a new operator, there is no guarantee that such replacement operator will achieve the same levels of production or sell oil or natural gas at the same price as the operator it replaced. We do not currently plan to enter into hedging arrangements with respect to the oil and natural gas production from our properties, and we will be exposed to the impact of decreases in the price of oil and natural gas.  We do not currently plan to enter into hedging arrangements to establish, in advance, a price for the sale of the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. As a result, although we may realize the benefit of any short-term increase in the price of oil and natural gas, we will not be protected against decreases in the price of oil and natural gas or prolonged periods of low commodity prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and cash available for distribution. If we enter into hedging arrangements in the future, it may limit our ability to realize the benefit of rising prices and may result in hedging losses.        6     Table of Contents Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our and our operators’ ability to succeed.  The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and the operators of our properties compete with other companies that may have greater resources or greater access to capital. Many of these companies explore for and produce oil and natural gas, carry on midstream and refining operations, and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods when market prices of oil and natural gas are low. Our operators’ larger competitors may be able to better address the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than our operators can, which could adversely affect our operators’ competitive position. Our operators may have access to fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our operators’ industry and may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. Furthermore, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced recent consolidation amongst some operators, which has resulted in certain instances of combined companies with larger resources. Such combined companies may compete against our operators or, in the case of consolidation amongst our operators, may choose to focus their operations on areas outside of our properties. In addition, we cannot guarantee our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future as this will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The Operating Partnership may participate in drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:   ●  pressure or irregularities in formations;    ●  equipment failures or accidents;    ●  unexpected drilling conditions;    ●  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;    ●  adverse weather conditions; and    ●  disputes with drill-site owners.  Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests or cash proceeds of a securities offering. Because of the limitations on our use of operating cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate operating cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions by first selling our securities to raise cash or by issuing our limited partnership interests. However, we may be unable to sell our securities in sufficient quantities and for sufficient consideration to provide adequate consideration to fund an acquisition, and sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our General Partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our General Partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our General Partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives.      7   Table of Contents A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are properties located in the Bakken region and Permian Basin. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment, services, or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the Operating Partnership. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the Operating Partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such full insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. Regulators have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from our properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future. Cyber incidents or attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and natural gas industry may adversely impact our operations, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection of our data, our business may be adversely impacted. We and our operators increasingly rely on information technology systems to operate our respective businesses, and the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies in exploration, development, production, and processing activities. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of the operators of our properties, vendors, suppliers, and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business activities. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for some period of time. While we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate exposure to such risk, cyber incidents and attacks are evolving and unpredictable. Our information technology systems and any insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. It is possible that our business, finances, systems and assets could be compromised in a cyber attack. The Partnership may be adversely affected by price volatility in the oil and natural gas markets. Historically, there has been price volatility in the oil and natural gas markets, which have been impacted by a number of factors, including actions by oil producing nations. For example, after OPEC and a group of oil producing nations led by Russia failed in March 2020 to agree on oil production cuts, Saudi Arabia announced that it would cut oil prices and increase production, leading to a sharp decline in oil and natural gas prices. While OPEC, Russia and other oil producing countries reached an agreement in April 2020 to reduce production levels, and U.S. production declined, oil prices remained lower than in previous years on account of an oversupply of oil and natural gas, with a simultaneous decrease in demand as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Thereafter, in 2021, oil and natural gas prices significantly rebounded. Although we continue to see sustained improvements in pricing, on account of a number of factors, the oil and natural gas markets remain subject to price volatility, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash distributions in periods of lower prices. During periods of substantial declines in prices, such as in 2020, oil and natural gas operators on our properties may suspend drilling programs, which would impact our revenues and operating income. In the event that any wells on our properties are shut-in, restarting wells may require significant costs from our operators, and we cannot guarantee that they would be able to restart at the same level. Moreover, due to the extremely volatile market conditions, we are unable to predict the degree or duration of any adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and other risks in our industry may be enhanced by such conditions. Continuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in federal monetary policy may result in increases to the costs of the goods, services and labor used by our operators, which could cause their capital expenditures and operating costs to rise and may delay or restrict their exploration and development activities. The rate of inflation in the U.S. has been steadily increasing since 2021 and through 2022. These inflationary pressures may result in increases to the costs of the goods, services and labor used by our operators, which could cause their capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Sustained levels of high inflation have likewise caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates, which could have the effects of raising the cost of capital and depressing economic growth, either of which- or the combination thereof-could hurt the financial and operating results of our operators’ businesses. If our operators are unable to secure the goods, services and labor necessary for their operations at reasonable costs, their exploration and development activities could be delayed or restricted, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow.      8   Table of Contents Regulatory and Environmental Risk Factors
 Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because of the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and natural gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required), and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain materials that are commonly used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are considered to be hazardous substances under CERCLA. Responsible persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site, regardless of whether the disposal of hazardous substances was lawful at the time of the disposal. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of these costs. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and many other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or natural gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority. The Federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements, such as emissions controls. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) continues to develop New Source Performance standards for oil and natural gas facilities. Most recently, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, on August 13, 2020, in response to an executive order by former President Trump, the EPA amended the New Source Performance standards to ease regulatory burdens, including rescinding standards applicable to transmission or storage segments and eliminating methane requirements altogether. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint resolution of Congress disapproving the 2020 amendments, with the exception of some technical changes, thereby reinstating the prior standards. The EPA expects owners and operators of regulated sources to take “immediate steps” to comply with these standards. Additionally, on November 15, 2021, the EPA published a proposed rule that would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry by requiring increased monitoring of fugitive emissions, imposing new requirements for pneumatic controllers and tank batteries, and prohibiting venting of natural gas in certain situations. On December 6, 2022, the EPA published a supplemental proposal to strengthen the emission reduction requirements, which would, among other things, expand leak detection requirements and tighten flaring restrictions. Federal changes will affect state air permitting programs in states that administer the federal CAA under a delegation of authority, including states in which we have operations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act” or “CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“USACOE”). On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the USACOE jointly promulgated a final rule redefining the scope of “Waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”), which would have made additional waters subject to the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. However, on October 22, 2019, the agencies published a final rule to repeal the 2015 WOTUS rule, and then, on April 21, 2020, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule replacing the 2015 rule, and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the CWA. On August 30, 2021, a federal court struck down the replacement rule and, on January 18, 2023, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule that would restore water protections that were in place prior to 2015. Meanwhile, in October 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in a case addressing the proper test for determining whether wetlands are “waters of the United States.” As a result of such recent developments, substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the CWA. To the extent the rules expand the range of properties subject to the CWA’s jurisdiction, our operators could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas, which could cause delays in development and/or increase the cost of development and operation of those properties. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (“SPCC”) regulations promulgated under the CWA and later amended by the Oil Pollutions Act of 1990 impose obligations and liabilities related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills into or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities that store oil in more than threshold quantities, the release of which could reasonably be expected to reach jurisdictional waters, must develop, implement, and maintain SPCC Plans. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Various federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and analogous state laws, restrict activities that may adversely affect listed endangered or threatened species or their habitat. If endangered or threatened species are located on our properties, operations on those properties could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Also, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access, development or operations (including prevent oil and natural gas exploration or production). Additionally, the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as endangered or threatened could result in the imposition of restrictions on our operators and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business.        9     Table of Contents Oil and natural gas operations are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes and their implementing regulations. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, the general duty clause and Risk Management Planning regulations promulgated under section 112(r) of the CAA and similar state statutes may require disclosure of information about hazardous materials used, produced or otherwise managed during operation. These laws also require the development of risk management plans for certain facilities to prevent accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of such releases should they occur. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing laws or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. Hydraulic fracturing is an important, common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as “Class II” Underground Injection Control wells under the SDWA. Future federal laws or regulations could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation or regulation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In addition, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. Also, on November 18, 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and natural gas operations on federal and Indian lands. On March 28, 2017, former President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rules and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule. State and environmental groups have challenged this rollback. Also, on September 28, 2018, the BLM published a final rule to revise the 2016 methane rule; however, a federal court struck down the scaled-back rule on July 15, 2020, and shortly thereafter, on October 8, 2020, another federal court struck down the 2016 methane rule. On November 28, 2022, the BLM announced a proposed replacement rule to reduce the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring and leaks during oil and gas production activities on federal and Indian lands, which would require the use of upgraded equipment in some cases and would place time and volume limits on royalty-free flaring. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the above rules will be implemented or if new requirements will be adopted. Each of these regulations, to the extent that they are reinstated or modified, may result in additional levels of regulation or complexity that could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase costs of compliance. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In response to a 2014 ballot initiative by the voters of the City of Denton, Texas banning hydraulic fracturing, the Texas legislature enacted a statute preempting local government regulation of oil and natural gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing. In other states, however, local governments may retain the ability to directly or indirectly regulate hydraulic fracturing. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties to comply with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells. Some states have become concerned about the connection between hydraulic fracturing-related activities, particularly the injection or disposal of produced water, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and they have adopted or are considering additional regulations regarding such activities. Changes in regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect the ability of the operators of the Royalty Properties and the operators of the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs to dispose of produced water and ultimately increase the cost of operation of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs or delay production schedules. Certain state agencies, including those in Texas and Oklahoma, have implemented regulations authorizing the imposition of certain limitations on existing wells if seismic activity increases in the area of an injection well, including a temporary injection ban. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporations Commission (“OCC”) has implemented a variety of measures, including the adoption of the National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications and may restrict operations at existing wells. Beginning in 2013, the OCC has ordered the reduction of disposal volumes into the Arbuckle formation. More recently, the OCC directed the shut in of a number of disposal wells due to increased earthquake activity in the Arbuckle formation and imposed further disposal well volume reductions in the Covington, Crescent, Enid, and Edmond areas. The Texas Railroad Commission has also implemented measures to assess the potential for seismic activity in the vicinity of disposal wells, and it has restricted and indefinitely suspended disposal well activities in some cases. Moreover, vigorous public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production continues and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas. Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies have also evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for our operators to perform fracturing and increase their costs of compliance and doing business. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. In recent years, federal, state, and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), which includes billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced biofuels and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration. These incentives could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, oil and natural gas and adversely impact our business. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of GHGs through a methane emissions charge. Specifically, the IRA amends the Clean Air Act to impose a fee on the emission of methane that exceeds an applicable waste emissions threshold from sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA, including sources in the offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting source categories. The methane emissions charge would start in calendar year 2024 at $900 per ton of methane, increase to $1,200 in 2025 and be set at $1,500 for 2026 and each year after. Calculation of the fee is based on certain thresholds established in the IRA. The methane emissions charge could increase our operators’ costs, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows. The EPA has also finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and almost half of the states have taken measures to reduce GHG emissions primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. In addition, states have imposed increasingly stringent requirements related to the venting or flaring of natural gas during oil and natural gas operations.        10     Table of Contents In addition, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”). The U.S. was among approximately 195 nations that signed an international accord in December 2015, the so called Paris Agreement, which became effective on November 4, 2016, with the objective of limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an Executive Order on January 20, 2021 to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which went into effect on February 19, 2021. On April 21, 2021, the United States announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, in connection with Glasgow Climate Pact, the United States and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. Although these international commitments are not directly binding on companies, additional GHG reduction regulatory requirements may be issued in an effort to help meet the U.S. commitments under the Paris Agreement. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may adopt additional climate change legislation, or whether EPA may promulgate additional regulation of GHGs from the oil and natural gas industry, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. It should also be noted that, recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. In addition, spurred by increasing concerns regarding climate change, the oil and natural gas industry faces growing demand for corporate transparency and a demonstrated commitment to sustainability goals. Environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) goals and programs, which typically include extralegal targets related to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance, have become an increasing focus of investors and shareholders across the industry. While reporting on ESG metrics remains voluntary, access to capital and investors is likely to favor companies with robust ESG programs in place. Ultimately, these initiatives could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Finally, climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operators’ activities and increase their costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. The outcome of pending litigation related to the Dakota Access Pipeline and any related executive orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash distributions. In connection with ongoing litigation initiated in February 2017 by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe contesting the validity of the process used by the USACOE to permit the Dakota Access Pipeline, on July 6, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the “Court”) issued an order vacating the USACOE’s easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and requiring that the pipeline be shut down by August 5, 2020. Dakota Access, LLC and the USACOE appealed the decision. On July 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals granted a temporary administrative stay, and on January 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals affirmed that part of the lower court decision vacating the USACOE’s easement while it prepares a new environmental impact statement, but reversed the lower court’s order to shut down the pipeline. Since then, both the Biden Administration and the Court have declined to shut down the pipeline, and on June 22, 2021, the Court dismissed the subject lawsuit. The Court noted, however, that future challenges were possible depending on the outcome of the ongoing environmental study, which is expected to be completed in Spring 2023. Accordingly, the continued operation of Dakota Access Pipeline in the future is uncertain. While this litigation does not directly impact our operations, we derive a significant amount of revenue from the Royalty Properties and NPIs we hold in the Bakken region, the region for which the Dakota Access Pipeline is intended to be a key pipeline. The outcome of this litigation may have a material adverse effect on our Royalty and NPI revenues derived from the Bakken region based on the timing of future development of wells on, or production of oil and natural gas from, or the method and cost of transportation related to the production on the properties. We have no control over the operation of such properties. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our General Partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the General Partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our General Partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our General Partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our General Partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder Schedule K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder Schedule K-1 tax statements will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our General Partner, and their ability to remove our General Partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our General Partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our General Partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our General Partner on an annual or any other basis. Our General Partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our General Partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our General Partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our General Partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our General Partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our General Partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.      11   Table of Contents The control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our General Partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our General Partner relating to their interests in our General Partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our General Partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the General Partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our General Partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our General Partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our General Partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of General Partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our General Partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our General Partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our General Partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our General Partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our General Partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 40% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our General Partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our General Partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the General Partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our General Partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Executive Officer, Bradley J. Ehrman, and Chief Financial Officer, Leslie A. Moriyama. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain. Tax Risk Factors
 The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and General Partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority. In 2020, we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI, including the previously aggregated Maecenas NPI, Bradley NPI, Republic NPI, and Spinnaker NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2020.      12   Table of Contents We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a ""qualifying income"" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. However, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other matter affecting us. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21%, and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Several states have subjected, or are evaluating ways to subject, partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation or the assessment of a material amount of entity-level taxation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, the President and members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships. Under current law, we believe that our royalty income is qualifying income for purposes of Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). If the current law remains effective in its current form, we believe we will continue to be able to meet the qualifying income requirement. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be changes to the federal income tax laws or the Treasury Department's interpretation of the qualifying income rules in a manner that could impact our ability to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in the future. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or otherwise adversely affect us. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. The recently enacted 20% deduction for certain pass-through income may not be available for our unitholders’ allocable share of our net income, in which case our unitholders’ tax liability with respect to ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or before December 31, 2025, an individual taxpayer may generally claim a deduction in the amount of 20% of its allocable share of certain publicly traded partnership income, including generally, among other items, the net amount of its items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a publicly traded partnership’s U.S. trade or business. Because we own only non-operated, passive mineral and royalty interests, most or all of the income that we now generate, or will generate in the future, may not be “qualifying publicly traded partnership income” eligible for the 20% deduction. If the deduction is not available, our unitholders’ tax liability from ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. We urge our unitholders to consult with their tax advisors regarding the availability of the 20% deduction on any income allocated from us. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final Treasury regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if the IRS challenges our method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction may be reallocated among our unitholders and our General Partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our General Partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold.      13   Table of Contents Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our General Partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the Operating Partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the Operating Partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the Operating Partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if the unitholder qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, the unitholder generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by the applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our General Partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors, and so we cannot predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders will be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on their share of taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if the unitholder lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, the unitholder may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where the unitholder resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We generally will have the ability to shift any such tax liability (including any applicable penalties and interest) to our General Partner and our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. If we are unable to have our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the economic burden resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.      14   Table of Contents Our unitholders may be subject to withholding tax upon transfers of their common units. If a unitholder sells or otherwise disposes of a common unit on or after January 1, 2023, the transferee generally will be required to withhold 10% of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person. However, final regulations issued by the Treasury Department on the application of these rules to transfers of certain publicly traded partnership interests, including our common units, provide that the obligation to withhold on a transfer of interests in a publicly traded partnership that is effected through a broker is imposed on the transferor’s broker (instead of the transferee), and the “amount realized” on such a transfer will generally be the amount of gross proceeds paid to the broker effecting the applicable transfer on behalf of the transferor (and thus determined without regard to any decrease in that transferor’s share of the publicly traded partnership's liabilities). Prospective foreign unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of these rules on an investment in our common units. General Risk Factors
 Public health threats could have an adverse effect on our Partnership, our cash flow and our industry. Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have been occurring in across the world, including the United States, could adversely impact our Partnership, drilling activities on our properties and the global economy. In particular, the outbreak starting in 2020 of a coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in quarantines, restrictions on travel and a decrease in economic activity across the world, which then resulted in a decrease in demand for hydrocarbons. At its height, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative effect on the global economy, supply chains and labor force participation, and created significant volatility in financial markets. Although the effects of the pandemic during 2022 were not as significant as prior years, new variants continued to cause waves of COVID-19 cases around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing variants may continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for hydrocarbons and the prices at which they are sold, which may impact our revenues and operating income, our cash distributions and our business generally. It is impossible to predict the effect of the continued spread, or fear of continued spread, of COVID-19 and its ongoing variants globally. No assurance can be given that public health threats will not have a material adverse effect, and that any further spread of COVID-19 and its ongoing variants will not have a material adverse effect, on our business, operations and financial results. The Partnership may be adversely affected by the global economic instability caused by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In February 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine, causing a military conflict which has contributed to increased economic uncertainty which may continue in 2023. An expansion or escalation of this conflict could lead to additional market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources along with instability in financial markets. As a result of the invasion, various economic and trade sanctions have been implemented by countries and private market participants on Russia which have resulted in a lower worldwide supply of oil and natural gas, contributing to a sharp increase in market prices for these commodities. Despite this increase in market prices for oil and natural gas, such sanctions, and other measures, as well as the existing and potential further responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, supply chain disruptions, tensions and military actions, could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will continue to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices. As a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, particularly since we are now a large accelerated filer and are no longer a smaller reporting company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased, and will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new or changing laws, regulations, and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. Further, failure to comply with these laws, regulations and standards may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members to serve on our board of directors or committees or as members of senior management. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in future uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology including ""may,"" ""believe,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""continue,"" or other similar words. These statements discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking information. These forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and, therefore, involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements for a number of important reasons, including those discussed under ""Risk Factors
"" and elsewhere in this report. Examples of such reasons include, but are not limited to, changes in the price or demand for oil and natural gas, public health crises including the worldwide coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak beginning in early 2020 and its ongoing variants, changes in the operations on or development of our properties, changes in economic and industry conditions and changes in regulatory requirements (including changes in environmental requirements) and our financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. You should read these statements carefully because they may discuss our expectations about our future performance, contain projections of our future operating results or our future financial condition, or state other forward-looking information. Before you invest, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events herein described in ""Item 1A – Risk Factors
"" and elsewhere in this report and in the Partnership’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our common units could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.      15   Table of Contents "
1,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2022-02-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:   ●  the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;    ●  the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;    ●  political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;    ●  the price and level of foreign imports;    ●  the level of consumer demand;    ●  the price and availability of alternative fuels;    ●  the availability of pipeline capacity;    ●  weather conditions;    ●  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and    ●  the overall economic environment.  Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders. We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the Operating Partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The Operating Partnership is unable to influence the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations, and general industry and economic conditions. The Operating Partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our General Partner, through the Operating Partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The Operating Partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, most of which are outside of our control.      5   Table of Contents The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Most of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. All of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of operating cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our General Partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our General Partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration. Acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Our operators’ failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in the deferral of prospective drilling opportunities. In addition, our ORRIs may terminate if the underlying acreage is not drilled before the expiration of the applicable lease or if the lease otherwise terminates. Leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. In addition, even if production or drilling is established during such primary term, if production or drilling ceases on the leased property, the lease typically terminates, subject to certain exceptions. Any reduction in our operators’ drilling programs, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of equipment, services, or supplies, could result in the expiration of existing leases. If the lease governing any of our mineral interests expires or terminates, all development rights typically revert back to us, and we may seek new lessees to explore and develop such mineral interests or in some states remain unleased. If the lease underlying any of our ORRIs expires or terminates, our ORRIs that are derived from such lease will also terminate. Any such expirations or terminations of our leases or our ORRIs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. If our operators suspend our right to receive royalty payments due to title or other issues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.  Our business depends, in part, on acquisitions which contribute to the growth of our reserves, production and cash generated from operations. In connection with these acquisitions, we are conveyed record title to mineral and royalty interests. Due to such changes in ownership of mineral interests, the operator of the underlying property has the right, at such operator’s discretion, to investigate and verify the title and ownership of mineral and royalty interests with respect to the properties it operates. If any title or ownership issues are not resolved to its reasonable satisfaction in accordance with customary industry standards, the operator has the right to suspend payment of the related royalty. If an operator of our properties is not satisfied with the documentation we provide to validate our ownership, such operator may suspend our royalty payment until such issues are resolved, at which time we would receive the full royalty payment which we would have otherwise received if not for the payment being suspended, without interest. Certain of our operators impose burdensome documentation requirements for title transfer and may keep royalty payments in suspense for significant periods of time. During the time that an operator puts our assets in pay suspense, we would not receive the applicable mineral or royalty payment owed to us from sales of the underlying oil or natural gas related to such mineral or royalty interest. If a significant amount of our royalty interests are placed in suspense, our results of operations and cash flow may be materially affected. Title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.  In our discretion, we may elect not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to our royalty and mineral interests. In such cases, we would rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before acquiring a specific royalty or mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can have a significant adverse effect on the value of an interest and can further materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may experience delays in received royalty payments and be unable to replace operators that do not make required royalty payments, and we may not be able to terminate our leases with defaulting lessees if any of the operators on those leases declare bankruptcy.  We may experience delays in receiving royalty payments from our operators, including as a result of delayed division orders received by our operators. Typically, the failure of an operator to make royalty payments to which we are entitled, gives us the right to terminate the lease, repossess the property and enforce payment obligations under the lease. If we repossessed any of our properties, we would seek a replacement operator. However, we cannot guarantee finding a suitable replacement operator in such a circumstance and if we did, we might not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the outgoing operator could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), in which case our right to enforce or terminate the lease for any defaults, including non-payment, may be substantially delayed or otherwise at risk. In general, in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, the bankrupt operator would have an extended period of time to decide whether to ultimately reject or assume the lease, which could significantly delay or prevent the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to a replacement operator. In the event that an operator rejects the lease, our ability to collect amounts owed to us would be substantially delayed, and our ultimate recovery may be only a fraction of the amount owed or nothing. In addition, if we are able to enter into a new lease with a new operator, there is no guarantee that such replacement operator will achieve the same levels of production or sell oil or natural gas at the same price as the operator it replaced.        6     Table of Contents We do not currently plan to enter into hedging arrangements with respect to the oil and natural gas production from our properties, and we will be exposed to the impact of decreases in the price of oil and natural gas.  We do not currently plan to enter into hedging arrangements to establish, in advance, a price for the sale of the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. As a result, although we may realize the benefit of any short-term increase in the price of oil and natural gas, we will not be protected against decreases in the price of oil and natural gas or prolonged periods of low commodity prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and cash available for distribution. If we enter into hedging arrangements in the future, it may limit our ability to realize the benefit of rising prices and may result in hedging losses. Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our and our operators’ ability to succeed.  The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and the operators of our properties compete with other companies that may have greater resources or greater access to capital. Many of these companies explore for and produce oil and natural gas, carry on midstream and refining operations, and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods when market prices of oil and natural gas are low. Our operators’ larger competitors may be able to better address the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than our operators can, which could adversely affect our operators’ competitive position. Our operators may have access to fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our operators’ industry and may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. Furthermore, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced recent consolidation amongst some operators, which has resulted in certain instances of combined companies with larger resources. Such combined companies may compete against our operators or, in the case of consolidation amongst our operators, may choose to focus their operations on areas outside of our properties. In addition, we cannot guarantee our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future as this will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The Operating Partnership may participate in drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:   ●  pressure or irregularities in formations;    ●  equipment failures or accidents;    ●  unexpected drilling conditions;    ●  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;    ●  adverse weather conditions; and    ●  disputes with drill-site owners.  Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests or cash proceeds of a securities offering. Because of the limitations on our use of operating cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate operating cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions by first selling our securities to raise cash or by issuing our limited partnership interests. However, we may be unable to sell our securities in sufficient quantities and for sufficient consideration to provide adequate consideration to fund an acquisition, and sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties.      7   Table of Contents Our partnership agreement obligates our General Partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our General Partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our General Partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives. A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are properties located in the Bakken region and Permian Basin. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment, services, or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the Operating Partnership. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the Operating Partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such full insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, in Oklahoma, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, regulators have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future.      8   Table of Contents Cyber incidents or attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and natural gas industry may adversely impact our operations, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection of our data, our business may be adversely impacted. We and our operators increasingly rely on information technology systems to operate our respective businesses, and the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies in exploration, development, production, and processing activities. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of the operators of our properties, vendors, suppliers, and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business activities. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for some period of time. While we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate exposure to such risk, cyber incidents and attacks are evolving and unpredictable. Our information technology systems and any insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. It is possible that our business, finances, systems and assets could be compromised in a cyber attack. The Partnership may be adversely affected by price volatility in the oil and natural gas markets. Historically, there has been price volatility in the oil and natural gas markets, which have been impacted by a number of factors, including actions by oil producing nations. For example, after OPEC and a group of oil producing nations led by Russia failed in March 2020 to agree on oil production cuts, Saudi Arabia announced that it would cut oil prices and increase production, leading to a sharp decline in oil and natural gas prices. While OPEC, Russia and other oil producing countries reached an agreement in April 2020 to reduce production levels, and U.S. production declined, oil prices remained lower than in previous years on account of an oversupply of oil and natural gas, with a simultaneous decrease in demand as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Thereafter, in 2021, oil and natural gas prices significantly rebounded. Although we continue to see sustained improvements in pricing, on account of a number of factors, including unusually high pricing due to extreme winter weather in early 2021, the oil and natural gas markets remain subject to price volatility, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash distributions in periods of lower prices. During periods of substantial declines in prices, such as in 2020, oil and natural gas operators on our properties may suspend drilling programs, which would impact our revenues and operating income. In the event that any wells on our properties are shut-in, restarting wells may require significant costs from our operators, and we cannot guarantee that they would be able to restart at the same level. Moreover, due to the extremely volatile market conditions, we are unable to predict the degree or duration of any adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and other risks in our industry may be enhanced by such conditions. Regulatory and Environmental Risk Factors
 Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because of the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and natural gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required), and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain materials that are commonly used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are considered to be hazardous substances under CERCLA. Responsible persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site, regardless of whether the disposal of hazardous substances was lawful at the time of the disposal. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of these costs. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and many other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or natural gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority.      9   Table of Contents The Federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements, such as emissions controls. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) continues to develop New Source Performance standards for oil and natural gas facilities. Most recently, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, on August 13, 2020, in response to an executive order by former President Trump, the EPA amended the New Source Performance standards to ease regulatory burdens, including rescinding standards applicable to transmission or storage segments and eliminating methane requirements altogether. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint resolution of Congress disapproving the 2020 amendments, with the exception of some technical changes, thereby reinstating the prior standards. The EPA expects owners and operators of regulated sources to take “immediate steps” to comply with these standards. Additionally, on November 15, 2021, the EPA published a proposed rule that would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry by requiring increased monitoring of fugitive emissions, imposing new requirements for pneumatic controllers and tank batteries, and prohibiting venting of natural gas in certain situations. Federal changes will affect state air permitting programs in states that administer the federal CAA under a delegation of authority, including states in which we have operations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act” or “CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“USACOE”). On June 29, 2015, EPA and the USACOE jointly promulgated a final rule redefining the scope of “Waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”), which would have made additional waters subject to the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. However, on October 22, 2019, the agencies published a final rule to repeal the 2015 WOTUS rule, and then, on April 21, 2020, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule replacing the 2015 rule, and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the CWA. On August 30, 2021, a federal court struck down the replacement rule and, on December 7, 2021, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule that would put back into place the pre-2015 definition of “waters of the United States,” updated to reflect Supreme Court decisions, while the agencies continue to consult with stakeholders on future regulatory actions. As a result of such recent developments, substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the CWA. To the extent the rules expand the range of properties subject to the CWA’s jurisdiction, our operators could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas, which could cause delays in development and/or increase the cost of development and operation of those properties. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (“SPCC”) regulations promulgated under the Clean Water Act and later amended by the Oil Pollutions Act of 1990 impose obligations and liabilities related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills into or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities that store oil in more than threshold quantities, the release of which could reasonably be expected to reach jurisdictional waters, must develop, implement, and maintain SPCC Plans. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Various federal laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and analogous state laws, restrict activities that may adversely affect listed endangered or threatened species or their habitat. If endangered or threatened species are located on our properties, operations on those properties could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Also, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access, development or operations (including prevent oil and natural gas exploration or production). Additionally, the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as endangered or threatened could result in the imposition of restrictions on our operators and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business. Oil and natural gas operations are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes and their implementing regulations. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, the general duty clause and Risk Management Planning regulations promulgated under section 112(r) of the CAA and similar state statutes may require disclosure of information about hazardous materials used, produced or otherwise managed during operation. These laws also require the development of risk management plans for certain facilities to prevent accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of such releases should they occur. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. Hydraulic fracturing is an important, common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as “Class II” Underground Injection Control wells under the SDWA. Future federal laws or regulations could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation or regulation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.      10   Table of Contents In addition, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. Also, on November 18, 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and natural gas operations on federal and Indian lands. On March 28, 2017, former President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rules and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule. State and environmental groups have challenged this rollback. Also, on September 28, 2018, the BLM published a final rule to revise the 2016 methane rule; however, a federal court struck down the scaled-back rule on July 15, 2020, and shortly thereafter, on October 8, 2020, another federal court struck down the 2016 methane rule. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the above rules will be implemented or if new requirements will be adopted. Each of these regulations, to the extent that they are reinstated or modified, may result in additional levels of regulation or complexity that could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase costs of compliance. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In response to a 2014 ballot initiative by the voters of the City of Denton, Texas banning hydraulic fracturing, the Texas legislature enacted a statute preempting local government regulation of oil and natural gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing. In other states, however, local governments may retain the ability to directly or indirectly regulate hydraulic fracturing. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties to comply with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells. Some states have become concerned about the connection between hydraulic fracturing-related activities, particularly the injection or disposal of produced water, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and they have adopted or are considering additional regulations regarding such activities. Changes in regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect the ability of the operators of the Royalty Properties and the operators of the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs to dispose of produced water and ultimately increase the cost of operation of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs or delay production schedules. Certain state agencies, including those in Texas and Oklahoma, have implemented regulations authorizing the imposition of certain limitations on existing wells if seismic activity increases in the area of an injection well, including a temporary injection ban. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporations Commission (“OCC”) has implemented a variety of measures, including the adoption of the National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications and may restrict operations at existing wells. Beginning in 2013, the OCC has ordered the reduction of disposal volumes into the Arbuckle formation. More recently, the OCC directed the shut in of a number of disposal wells due to increased earthquake activity in the Arbuckle formation and imposed further disposal well volume reductions in the Covington, Crescent, Enid, and Edmond areas. The Texas Railroad Commission has also implemented measures to assess the potential for seismic activity in the vicinity of disposal wells, and it has restricted and indefinitely suspended disposal well activities in some cases. Moreover, vigorous public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production continues and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas. Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies have also evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for our operators to perform fracturing and increase their costs of compliance and doing business. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, such as the Build Back Better Act approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2021. To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation. Almost half of the states, however, have taken measures to reduce GHG emissions primarily though the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. In addition, states have imposed increasingly stringent requirements related to the venting or flaring of natural gas during oil and natural gas operations. Responding to scientific studies that have suggested that emissions of GHGs, including gases associated with the oil and natural gas sector such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide among others, may be contributing to global warming and other environmental effects, the EPA has begun to adopt regulations to report and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Any such regulations may have the potential to affect our business, customers or the energy sector generally. In addition, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”). The U.S. was among approximately 195 nations that signed an international accord in December 2015, the so called Paris Agreement, which became effective on November 4, 2016, with the objective of limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an Executive Order on January 20, 2021 to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which went into effect on February 19, 2021. On April 21, 2021, the United States announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. In November 2021, in connection with Glasgow Climate Pact, the United States and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. Although these international commitments are not directly binding on companies, additional GHG reduction regulatory requirements may be issued in an effort to help meet the U.S. commitments under the Paris Agreement.      11   Table of Contents Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, or whether EPA may promulgate additional regulation of GHGs from the oil and natural gas industry, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. It should also be noted that, recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. In addition, spurred by increasing concerns regarding climate change, the oil and natural gas industry faces growing demand for corporate transparency and a demonstrated commitment to sustainability goals. Environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) goals and programs, which typically include extralegal targets related to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance, have become an increasing focus of investors and shareholders across the industry. While reporting on ESG metrics remains voluntary, access to capital and investors is likely to favor companies with robust ESG programs in place. Ultimately, these initiatives could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Finally, climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operators’ activities and increase their costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations. The new Biden administration, acting through the executive branch or in coordination with Congress, could enact rules and regulations that reduce our revenues and cash distributions in the future or increase operating costs for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. President Biden has indicated that he is supportive of various programs and initiatives designed to, among other things, curtail climate change, control the release of methane from new and existing oil and natural gas operations, and decarbonize electric generation and the transportation sector. During his first month in office, in January 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order temporarily suspending oil and natural gas permitting on federal lands and offshore waters. While the moratorium was lifted in June 2021, President Biden has indicated that his administration is likely to pursue additional measures to limit GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations. It remains unclear, however, what specific actions President Biden will take and what support he will have for any potential legislative changes from Congress. Further, it is uncertain to what extent any new environmental laws or regulations, or any repeal of existing environmental laws or regulations, may affect our business or operations. However, any of these actions could adversely affect our revenues and cash distributions by requiring oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on the amount of and demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. The outcome of pending litigation related to the Dakota Access Pipeline and any related executive orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash distributions. In connection with ongoing litigation initiated in February 2017 by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe contesting the validity of the process used by the USACOE to permit the Dakota Access Pipeline, on July 6, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the “Court”) issued an order vacating the USACOE’s easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and requiring that the pipeline be shut down by August 5, 2020. Dakota Access, LLC and the USACOE appealed the decision. On July 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals granted a temporary administrative stay, and on January 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals affirmed that part of the lower court decision vacating the USACOE’s easement while it prepares a new environmental impact statement, but reversed the lower court’s order to shut down the pipeline. Since then, both the Biden Administration and the Court have declined to shut down the pipeline, and on June 22, 2021, the Court dismissed the subject lawsuit. The Court noted, however, that future challenges were possible depending on the outcome of the ongoing environmental study, which is expected to be completed in late 2022. Accordingly, the continued operation of Dakota Access Pipeline in the future is uncertain. While this litigation does not directly impact our operations, we derive a significant amount of revenue from the Royalty Properties and NPIs we hold in the Bakken region, the region for which the Dakota Access Pipeline is intended to be a key pipeline. The outcome of this litigation may have a material adverse affect on our Royalty and NPI revenues derived from the Bakken region based on the timing of future development of wells on, or production of oil and natural gas from, or the method and cost of transportation related to the production on the properties. We have no control over the operation of such properties. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our General Partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the General Partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our General Partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our General Partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our General Partner.      12   Table of Contents Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our General Partner, and their ability to remove our General Partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our General Partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our General Partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our General Partner on an annual or any other basis. Our General Partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our General Partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our General Partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our General Partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our General Partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our General Partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our General Partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our General Partner relating to their interests in our General Partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our General Partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the General Partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our General Partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our General Partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our General Partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of General Partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our General Partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our General Partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our General Partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our General Partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our General Partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 40% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our General Partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our General Partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the General Partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution.      13   Table of Contents Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our General Partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, Bradley J. Ehrman, its Chief Operating Officer and Leslie A. Moriyama, its Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain. Tax Risk Factors
 The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and General Partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority. In 2020, we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI, including the previously aggregated Maecenas NPI, Bradley NPI, Republic NPI, and Spinnaker NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2020. We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a ""qualifying income"" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. However, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other matter affecting us. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21%, and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Several states have subjected, or are evaluating ways to subject, partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation or the assessment of a material amount of entity-level taxation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, the President and members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships. Under current law, we believe that our royalty income is qualifying income for purposes of Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). If the current law remains effective in its current form, we believe we will continue to be able to meet the qualifying income requirement. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be changes to the federal income tax laws or the Treasury Department's interpretation of the qualifying income rules in a manner that could impact our ability to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in the future. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or otherwise adversely affect us. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.      14   Table of Contents The recently enacted 20% deduction for certain pass-through income may not be available for our unitholders’ allocable share of our net income, in which case our unitholders’ tax liability with respect to ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or before December 31, 2025, an individual taxpayer may generally claim a deduction in the amount of 20% of its allocable share of certain publicly traded partnership income, including generally, among other items, the net amount of its items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a publicly traded partnership’s U.S. trade or business. Because we own only non-operated, passive mineral and royalty interests, most or all of the income that we now generate, or will generate in the future, may not be “qualifying publicly traded partnership income” eligible for the 20% deduction. If the deduction is not available, our unitholders’ tax liability from ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. We urge our unitholders to consult with their tax advisors regarding the availability of the 20% deduction on any income allocated from us. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final Treasury regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if the IRS challenges our method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction may be reallocated among our unitholders and our General Partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our General Partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our General Partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the Operating Partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Our unitholders may be subject to withholding tax upon transfers of their common units. If a unitholder sells or otherwise disposes of a common unit, the transferee generally is required to withhold 10% of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person, and we are required to deduct and withhold from distributions to the transferee amounts that should have been withheld by the transferee but were not withheld. Final regulations issued on October 7, 2020, provide rules for withholding on the transfer of a partnership interest in a publicly traded partnership. However, the Treasury Department and the IRS have suspended these rules for transfers of certain publicly traded partnership interests, including transfers of our common units, that occur before January 1, 2023. For transfers of our common units occurring on or after January 1, 2023, withholding will be required on open market transactions, but in the case of a transfer made through a broker, a partner’s share of liabilities will be excluded from the amount realized. In addition, the obligation to withhold will be imposed on the broker instead of the transferee (and we will generally not be required to withhold from the transferee amounts that should have been withheld by the transferee but were not withheld). Prospective foreign unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of these rules on an investment in our common units.      15   Table of Contents Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the Operating Partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the Operating Partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if the unitholder qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, the unitholder generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by the applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our General Partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors, and so we cannot predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders will be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on their share of taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if the unitholder lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, the unitholder may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where the unitholder resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We generally will have the ability to shift any such tax liability (including any applicable penalties and interest) to our General Partner and our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. If we are unable to have our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the economic burden resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.      16   Table of Contents General Risk Factors
 Public health threats could have an adverse effect on our Partnership, our cash flow and our industry. Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have been occurring in across the world, including the United States, could adversely impact our Partnership, drilling activities on our properties and the global economy. In particular, the outbreak starting in 2020 of a coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in quarantines, restrictions on travel and a decrease in economic activity across the world, which has resulted in a decrease in demand for hydrocarbons. The COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing variants may continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for hydrocarbons and the prices at which they are sold, which may impact our revenues and operating income, our cash distributions and our business generally. It is impossible to predict the effect of the continued spread, or fear of continued spread, of COVID-19 and its ongoing variants globally. No assurance can be given that public health threats will not have a material adverse effect, and that any further spread of COVID-19 and its ongoing variants will not have a material adverse effect, on our business, operations and financial results. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.

"" and elsewhere in this report and in the Partnership’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our common units could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. "
2,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2021-02-25,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:   ●  the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;    ●  the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;    ●  political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;    ●  the price and level of foreign imports;    ●  the level of consumer demand;    ●  the price and availability of alternative fuels;    ●  the availability of pipeline capacity;    ●  weather conditions;    ●  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and    ●  the overall economic environment.  Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders. We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the Operating Partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The Operating Partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations, and general industry and economic conditions.        5     Table of Contents The Operating Partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our General Partner, through the Operating Partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The Operating Partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, some of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Some of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. All of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of operating cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our General Partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our General Partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration. Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The Operating Partnership may participate in drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:   ●  pressure or irregularities in formations;    ●  equipment failures or accidents;    ●  unexpected drilling conditions;    ●  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;    ●  adverse weather conditions; and    ●  disputes with drill-site owners.  Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs.        6     Table of Contents Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests or cash proceeds of a securities offering. Because of the limitations on our use of operating cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate operating cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions by first selling our securities to raise cash or by issuing our limited partnership interests. However, we may be unable to sell our securities in sufficient quantities and for sufficient consideration to provide adequate consideration to fund an acquisition, and sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our General Partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our General Partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our General Partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives. A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are properties located in the Bakken region and Permian Basin. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified.        7     Table of Contents Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the Operating Partnership. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the Operating Partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such full insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, in Oklahoma, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, regulators have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future. Cyber incidents or attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection of our data, our business may be adversely impacted. We and our operators increasingly rely on information technology systems to operate our respective businesses, and the oil and gas industry depends on digital technologies in exploration, development, production, and processing activities. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of the operators of our properties, vendors, suppliers, and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business activities. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for some period of time. While we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate exposure to such risk, cyber incidents and attacks are evolving and unpredictable. Our information technology systems and any insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. It is possible that our business, finances, systems and assets could be compromised in a cyber attack.        8     Table of Contents The Partnership may be adversely affected by the recent oversupply of oil and natural gas as a result of the actions of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Recent actions by Saudi Arabia and Russia have caused a worldwide oversupply in oil and natural gas. After OPEC and a group of oil producing nations led by Russia failed in March 2020 to agree on oil production cuts, Saudi Arabia announced that it would cut oil prices and increase production, leading to a sharp further decline in oil and natural gas prices. While OPEC, Russia and other oil producing countries reached an agreement in April 2020 to reduce production levels, and U.S. production has declined, oil prices remain lower than in recent years on account of an oversupply of oil and natural gas, with a simultaneous decrease in demand as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, and such significant decrease in the prices of hydrocarbons may have a material adverse effect on our cash distributions. Oil and natural gas operators on our properties may suspend drilling programs and may lose significant customers as purchasers, which would impact our revenues and operating income. In the event that any wells on our properties are shut-in, restarting wells may require significant costs from our operators, and we cannot guarantee that they would be able to restart at the same level. Moreover, due to the extremely volatile market conditions, we are unable to predict the degree or duration of any adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and other risks in our industry may be enhanced by such conditions. Regulatory and Environmental Risk Factors
 Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because of the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain materials that are commonly used in connection with oil and gas operations are considered to be hazardous substances under CERCLA. Responsible persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site, regardless of whether the disposal of hazardous substances was lawful at the time of the disposal. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of these costs. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and many other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority. The Federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements, such as emissions controls. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from oil and gas facilities. Most recently, EPA published two new rules on September 14 and 15, 2020 that remove the transmission and storage sectors of the oil and gas industry from regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and rescind methane-specific standards for the production and processing segments of the industry. However, states and environmental groups brought suit challenging the new rules almost immediately. Although the bulk of the 2012 and 2016 standards are currently in effect, future implementation and the ultimate scope of the 2012 and 2016 standards are uncertain at this time as a result of these challenges and current uncertainty regarding how the standards may be altered under the administration of recently elected U.S. President Biden. Federal changes will affect state air permitting programs in states that administer the federal CAA under a delegation of authority, including states in which we have operations.        9     Table of Contents In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final version of its venting and flaring rule, which imposes stricter reporting obligations and limits venting and flaring of natural gas on federal and Indian lands. Some provisions of the venting and flaring rule went into effect on January 17, 2017. The BLM subsequently announced that it was postponing until January 17, 2019, the implementation of other aspects of the venting and flaring rule, which were originally scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 2018. Then, in February 2018, the BLM issued a proposed rule which would rescind, modify, and retain portions of the November 2016 rule. And in September 2018, the BLM announced a final rule that revises the 2016 rule, which was immediately followed by litigation challenging the agency’s actions. Most recently, in October 2020, a ruling by the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming resulted in vacatur of the 2016 venting and flaring rule with the exception of certain royalty provisions. In March 2015, the BLM released its new regulations governing hydraulic fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming temporarily stayed implementation of this rule in June 2016, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit later lifted the lower court’s stay on the basis that the BLM had proposed to rescind the rule in June 2017. In December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. BLM’s repeal of the rule was challenged in court, and in April 2020, the Northern District of California issued a ruling in favor of the BLM. Each of these regulations, to the extent that they are reinstated or modified, may result in additional levels of regulation or complexity that could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase costs of compliance. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act” or “CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“USACOE”). In May 2015, EPA and the USACOE jointly announced a final rule defining the “Waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”), that are protected under the Clean Water Act. However, the rule, which would have made additional waters expressly WOTUS and, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, rather than subject to a case-specific evaluation and EPA’s subsequent rulemaking actions to delay implementation and repeal the rule has been heavily litigated since. In September 2019, EPA finalized the repeal of the 2015 WOTUS rule, and the repeal became effective in December 2019, reinstating the pre 2015 standards. Litigation of the repeal quickly ensued. Meanwhile, in December 2018, the EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rule to revise the definition of “WOTUS.” The rule was finalized in January 2020, and became effective in June 2020. The rule narrows the WOTUS definition, excluding, for example, streams that flow only after precipitation and wetlands without a direct surface connection to traditional navigable waters. Litigation by parties opposing the rule again quickly followed, including a challenge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, which resulted in a statewide stay of the rule on June 19, 2020. This ruling is currently being appealed in the Tenth Circuit. Regardless, the applicable WOTUS definition affects what CWA permitting or other regulatory obligations may be triggered during development and operation of Royalty Properties, and changes to the WOTUS definition could cause delays in development and/or increase the cost of development and operation of those properties. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (“SPCC”) regulations promulgated under the Clean Water Act and later amended by the Oil Pollutions Act of 1990 impose obligations and liabilities related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills into or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities that store oil in more than threshold quantities, the release of which could reasonably be expected to reach jurisdictional waters, must develop, implement, and maintain SPCC Plans. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program require that permits be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring be conducted periodically to ensure that the disposed waters are not leaking into groundwater. In addition, because some states have become concerned that the injection or disposal of produced water could, under certain circumstances, trigger or contribute to seismic activity, they have adopted or are considering additional regulations regarding such disposal methods. Changes in regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect the ability of the operators of the Royalty Properties and the operators of the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs to dispose of produced water and ultimately increase the cost of operation of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs or delay production schedules. Certain state agencies, including those in Texas and Oklahoma, have implemented regulations authorizing the imposition of certain limitations on existing wells if seismic activity increases in the area of an injection well, including a temporary injection ban. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporations Commission (“OCC”) has implemented a variety of measures, including the adoption of the National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications and may restrict operations at existing wells. Beginning in 2013, the OCC has ordered the reduction of disposal volumes into the Arbuckle formation. More recently, the OCC directed the shut in of a number of disposal wells due to increased earthquake activity in the Arbuckle formation and imposed further disposal well volume reductions in the Covington, Crescent, Enid, and Edmond areas. Moreover, vigorous public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production continues, and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas.        10     Table of Contents In addition, several cases have recently put a spotlight on the issue of whether injection wells may be regulated under the Clean Water Act if a direct hydrological connection to a jurisdictional surface water can be established. The split among federal circuit courts of appeals that decided these cases engendered two petitions for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court in August 2018, one of which was granted in February 2019. EPA has also brought attention to the reach of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction in such instances. EPA issued a request for comment in February 2018 regarding the applicability of the Clean Water Act permitting program to discharges into groundwater with a direct hydrological connection to jurisdictional surface water, which hydrological connections should be considered “direct,” and whether such discharges would be better addressed through other federal or state programs, but concluded in April 2019 that the Clean Water Act should not be interpreted to require permits for discharges of pollutants that reach surface waters via groundwater. However, in April 2020, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case County of Maui, Hawaii v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund, holding that discharges into groundwater may be regulated under the CWA if the discharge is the “functional equivalent” of a direct discharge into navigable waters. On December 10, 2020, EPA issued a draft guidance on the ruling, which emphasized that discharges to groundwater are not necessarily the “functional equivalent” of a direct discharge based solely on proximity to jurisdictional waters. If in the future CWA permitting is required for any saltwater injection wells as a result of the Supreme Court’s ruling in County of Maui, Hawaii v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund, the costs of permitting and compliance for any injection well operations could increase. Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds and their habitat, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the CWA, and CERCLA. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access, development or operations (including prevent oil and gas exploration or production). Where takings of, or harm to, species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to restrict or prevent oil and gas exploration or production activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or production activities, including, for example, for releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and may seek natural resources damages and, in some cases, criminal penalties. Oil and Gas operations are be subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes and their implementing regulations. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, the general duty clause and Risk Management Planning regulations promulgated under section 112(r) of the CAA and similar state statutes may require disclosure of information about hazardous materials used, produced or otherwise managed during operation. These laws also require the development of risk management plans for certain facilities to prevent accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of such releases should they occur. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal regulation under the SDWA, provided that diesel fuel is not used in the fracturing process. In addition, in February 2014, the EPA published final guidance that broadly defined diesel fuel and which requires the issuance of a Class II Underground Injection Control permit for hydraulic fracturing treatments using diesel fuel. These requirements may cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process using diesel fuel. Further, in each session of Congress since 2009, legislation has been introduced that would have repealed the hydraulic fracturing exemption. If similar legislation were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In response to a 2014 ballot initiative by the voters of the City of Denton, Texas banning hydraulic fracturing, the Texas legislature enacted a statute preempting local government regulation of oil and gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing. In other states, however, local governments may retain the ability to directly or indirectly regulate hydraulic fracturing. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties to comply with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells.        11     Table of Contents The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress or executive orders or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, such as a resolution referred to as the Green New Deal, which was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in February 2019. To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation. Almost half of the states, however, have developed GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. These cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. Responding to scientific studies that have suggested that emissions of gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” including gases associated with the oil and gas sector such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide among others, may be contributing to global warming and other environmental effects, the EPA has begun to adopt regulations to report and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Any such regulations may have the potential to affect our business, customers or the energy sector generally. In addition, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”). The U.S. was among approximately 195 nations that signed an international accord in December 2015, the so called Paris Agreement, which became effective in 2016, with the objective of limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Although the U.S. took steps to withdraw from the Paris Agreement during President Trump’s administration, the earliest date of withdrawal under the terms of the agreement was November 4, 2020, one day after the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. President Biden issued an Executive Order on January 20, 2021 committing to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Although the Paris Agreement does not include obligations that are directly binding on companies, additional GHG reduction regulatory requirements may be issued in an effort to help meet the U.S. commitments under the Paris Agreement. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, or whether EPA may promulgate additional regulation of GHGs from the oil and gas industry, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require oil and gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from the Royalty Properties. Finally, it should be noted that, recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. In addition, spurred by increasing concerns regarding climate change, the oil and gas industry faces growing demand for corporate transparency and a demonstrated commitment to sustainability goals. Environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) goals and programs, which typically include extralegal targets related to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance, have become an increasing focus of investors and shareholders across the industry. While reporting on ESG metrics remains voluntary, access to capital and investors is likely to favor companies with robust ESG programs in place. Ultimately, these initiatives could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. The new Biden administration, acting through the executive branch or in coordination with Congress, could enact rules and regulations that reduce our revenues and cash distributions in the future or increase operating costs for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. During the campaign, President Biden stated that, if elected President, he would issue Executive Orders to permanently protect certain federal lands, establish monuments, restrict new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, and modify royalties to account for climate costs. In January 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order temporarily suspending oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters for 60 days. In addition, President Biden has indicated that his administration is likely to pursue more stringent methane pollution limits for new and existing oil and gas operations. These efforts, among others, are intended to support Mr. Biden’s stated goal of addressing climate change. Potential actions of a Democratic-controlled Congress include imposing more restrictive laws and regulations pertaining to permitting, limitations on greenhouse gas emissions, increased requirements for financial assurance and bonding for decommissioning liabilities, and carbon taxes. Any of these administrative or Congressional actions could adversely affect our revenues and cash distributions by requiring oil and gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on the amount of and demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. The outcome of pending litigation related to the Dakota Access Pipeline and any related executive orders could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash distributions. In connection with ongoing litigation initiated in February 2017 by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe contesting the validity of the process used by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (the “Army Corps”) to permit the Dakota Access Pipeline, on July 6, 2020, the United States Court for the District of Columbia (the “Court”) issued an order vacating the Army Corps’ easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and requiring that the pipeline be shut down by August 5, 2020. Dakota Access, LLC and the Army Corps appealed the decision and filed a motion for a stay pending appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the “Court of Appeals”). On July 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals granted a temporary administrative stay to allow the Court time to consider briefing on whether to continue the stay until the appeal is decided on the merits. On January 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals affirmed that part of the lower court decision vacating the Army Corps’ easement while it prepares a new environmental impact statement, but reversed the lower court’s order to shut down the pipeline because the lower court had not properly evaluated such a move under the applicable test under case law. As stated by the Court of Appeals, the Army Corps is within its authority to shut down the pipeline and the Court of Appeals would expect the Army Corps to make that decision “promptly.” On February 9, 2021, the Army Corps, through the Department of Justice, sought a delay of the proceedings to give lawyers time to brief the new presidential administration on the background of the Dakota Access Pipeline matter. Accordingly, the continued operation of Dakota Access Pipeline in the future is uncertain, and an Executive Order by President Biden could significantly impact the Dakota Access Pipeline. While this litigation does not directly impact our operations, we derive a significant amount of revenue from the Royalty Properties and NPIs we hold in the Bakken region, the region for which the Dakota Access Pipeline is intended to be a key pipeline. The outcome of this litigation may have a material adverse affect on our Royalty and NPI revenues derived from the Bakken region based on the timing of future development of wells on, or production of oil and natural gas from, or the method and cost of transportation related to the production on the properties. We have no control over the operation of such properties.        12     Table of Contents Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our General Partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the General Partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our General Partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our General Partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our General Partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our General Partner, and their ability to remove our General Partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our General Partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our General Partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our General Partner on an annual or any other basis. Our General Partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our General Partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our General Partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our General Partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our General Partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our General Partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our General Partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our General Partner relating to their interests in our General Partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our General Partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the General Partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our General Partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our General Partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our General Partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of General Partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our General Partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our General Partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our General Partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our General Partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our General Partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders.        13     Table of Contents We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 40% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our General Partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our General Partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the General Partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our General Partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, Bradley J. Ehrman, its Chief Operating Officer and Leslie A. Moriyama, its Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain.        14     Table of Contents Tax Risk Factors
 The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and General Partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority. In 2020, we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI, including the previously aggregated Maecenas NPI, Bradley NPI, Republic NPI, and Spinnaker NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2020. We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a ""qualifying income"" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. However, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other matter affecting us. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21%, and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Several states have subjected, or are evaluating ways to subject, partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation or the assessment of a material amount of entity-level taxation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, the President and members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships. Under current law, we believe that our royalty income is qualifying income for purposes of Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). If the current law remains effective in its current form, we believe we will continue to be able to meet the qualifying income requirement. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be changes to the federal income tax laws or the Treasury Department's interpretation of the qualifying income rules in a manner that could impact our ability to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in the future. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or otherwise adversely affect us. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.        15     Table of Contents The recently enacted 20% deduction for certain pass-through income may not be available for our unitholders’ allocable share of our net income, in which case our unitholders’ tax liability with respect to ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or before December 31, 2025, an individual taxpayer may generally claim a deduction in the amount of 20% of its allocable share of certain publicly traded partnership income, including generally, among other items, the net amount of its items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a publicly traded partnership’s U.S. trade or business. Because we own only non-operated, passive mineral and royalty interests, most or all of the income that we now generate, or will generate in the future, may not be “qualifying publicly traded partnership income” eligible for the 20% deduction. If the deduction is not available, our unitholders’ tax liability from ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. We urge our unitholders to consult with their tax advisors regarding the availability of the 20% deduction on any income allocated from us. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final Treasury regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if the IRS challenges our method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction may be reallocated among our unitholders and our General Partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our General Partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our General Partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the Operating Partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value.        16     Table of Contents Our unitholders may be subject to withholding tax upon transfers of their common units. If a unitholder sells or otherwise disposes of a common unit, the transferee generally is required to withhold 10% of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person, and we are required to deduct and withhold from distributions to the transferee amounts that should have been withheld by the transferee but were not withheld. Final regulations issued on October 7, 2020, provide rules for withholding on the transfer of a partnership interest in a publicly traded partnership. However, the Treasury Department and the IRS have suspended these rules for transfers of certain publicly traded partnership interests, including transfers of our common units, that occur before January 1, 2022. For transfers of our common units occurring on or after January 1, 2022, withholding will be required on open market transactions, but in the case of a transfer made through a broker, a partner’s share of liabilities will be excluded from the amount realized. In addition, the obligation to withhold will be imposed on the broker instead of the transferee (and we will generally not be required to withhold from the transferee amounts that should have been withheld by the transferee but were not withheld). Prospective foreign unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of these rules on an investment in our common units. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the Operating Partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the Operating Partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if the unitholder qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, the unitholder generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by the applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our General Partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units.        17     Table of Contents The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors, and so we cannot predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders will be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on their share of taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if the unitholder lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, the unitholder may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where the unitholder resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We generally will have the ability to shift any such tax liability (including any applicable penalties and interest) to our General Partner and our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. If we are unable to have our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the economic burden resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. General Risk Factors
 Public health threats could have an adverse effect on our Partnership, our cash flow and our industry. Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have been occurring in across the world, including the United States, could adversely impact our Partnership, drilling activities on our properties and the global economy. In particular, the outbreak starting in 2020 of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in quarantines, restrictions on travel and a decrease in economic activity across the world, which has resulted in a decrease in demand for hydrocarbons. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for hydrocarbons and the prices at which they are sold, which may impact our revenues and operating income, our cash distributions and our business generally. It is impossible to predict the effect of the continued spread, or fear of continued spread, of COVID-19 globally.

BUSINESS General Dorchester Minerals, L.P. is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership that commenced operations on January 31, 2003, upon the combination of Dorchester Hugoton, Ltd., Republic Royalty Company, L.P. and Spinnaker Royalty Company, L.P. Dorchester Hugoton was a publicly traded Texas limited partnership, and Republic and Spinnaker were private Texas limited partnerships. Our common units are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “DMLP”. American Stock Transfer & Trust Company is our registrar and transfer agent and its address and telephone number is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219, (800) 937-5449. Our executive offices are located at 3838 Oak Lawn Avenue, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas, 75219-4541, and our telephone number is (214) 559-0300. We have established a website at www.dmlp.net that contains the last annual meeting presentation and a link to the NASDAQ website. You may obtain all current filings free of charge at our website. We will provide electronic or paper copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) free of charge upon written request at our executive offices. In this report, the term ""Partnership,"" as well as the terms ""us,"" ""our,"" ""we,"" and ""its"" are sometimes used as abbreviated references to Dorchester Minerals, L.P. itself or Dorchester Minerals, L.P. and its related entities. Our general partner is Dorchester Minerals Management LP, which is managed by its general partner, Dorchester Minerals Management GP LLC. As a result, the Board of Managers of Dorchester Minerals Management GP LLC exercises effective control of the Partnership. In this report, the term ""general partner"" is used as an abbreviated reference to Dorchester Minerals Management LP. Our general partner also controls and owns, directly and indirectly, all of the Partnership interests in Dorchester Minerals Operating LP and its general partner. Dorchester Minerals Operating LP owns working interests and other properties underlying our Net Profits Interests (or “NPIs”), provides day-to-day operational and administrative services to us and our general partner, and is the employer of all the employees who perform such services. In this report, the term ""operating partnership"" is used as an abbreviated reference to Dorchester Minerals Operating LP. Our general partner and the operating partnership are Delaware limited partnerships, and the general partners of their general partners are Delaware limited liability companies. These entities and our Partnership were initially formed in December 2001 in connection with the combination. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Dorchester Minerals Oklahoma LP and its general partner are Oklahoma entities that acquired our wholly owned acquisition subsidiary and its general partner by merger on December 31, 2009. On March 31, 2010, we formed a new subsidiary, and it acquired all of the outstanding partnership interests in Maecenas Minerals LLP, a Texas limited liability partnership. Our business may be described as the acquisition, ownership and administration of Royalty Properties and NPIs. The Royalty Properties consist of producing and nonproducing mineral, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits, and leasehold interests located in 574 counties and parishes in 25 states (“Royalty Properties”). The NPIs represent net profits overriding royalty interests in various properties owned by the operating partnership. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute quarterly an amount equal to all funds that we receive from the Royalty Properties and the NPIs (other than cash proceeds received by the Partnership from a public or private offering of securities of the Partnership) less certain expenses and reasonable reserves. Our partnership agreement allows us to grow by acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties, subject to the limitations described below. The approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common units is required for our general partner to cause us to acquire or obtain any oil and natural gas property interest, unless the acquisition is complementary to our business and is made either:  ●in exchange for our limited partner interests, including common units, not exceeding 40% of the common units outstanding after issuance; or    ●in exchange for cash proceeds of any public or private offer and sale of limited partner interests, including common units, or options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to the limited partner interests, including common units; or  ●in exchange for other cash from our operations, if the aggregate cost of any acquisitions made for cash during the twelve-month period ending on the first to occur of the execution of a definitive agreement for the acquisition or its consummation is no more than 10% of our aggregate cash distributions for the four most recent fiscal quarters. Unless otherwise approved by the holders of a majority of our common units, in the event that we acquire properties for a combination of cash and limited partner interests, including common units, (i) the cash component of the acquisition consideration must be equal to or less than 5% of the aggregate cash distributions made by the Partnership for the four most recent quarters and (ii) the amount of limited partnership interests, including common units, to be issued in such acquisition, after giving effect to such issuance, shall not exceed 10% of the common units outstanding. 1Table of Contents Credit Facilities and Financing Plans We do not have a credit facility in place, nor do we anticipate doing so. We do not anticipate incurring any debt, other than trade debt incurred in the ordinary course of our business. Our partnership agreement prohibits us from incurring indebtedness, other than trade payables, (i) in excess of $50,000 in the aggregate at any given time; or (ii) which would constitute ""acquisition indebtedness"" (as defined in Section 514 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), in order to avoid unrelated business taxable income for federal income tax purposes. We may finance any growth of our business through acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties by issuing additional limited partnership interests or with cash, subject to the limits described above and in our partnership agreement. Under our partnership agreement, we may also finance our growth through the issuance of additional partnership securities, including options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights with respect to partnership securities from time to time in exchange for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our general partner in its sole discretion. However, we may not issue limited partnership interests that would represent over 40% of the outstanding limited partnership interests immediately after giving effect to such issuance or that would have greater rights or powers than our common units without the approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common units. Except in connection with qualifying acquisitions, we do not currently anticipate issuing additional partnership securities. We have effective registration statements on Form S-4 registering an aggregate of 8,000,000 common units that may be offered and issued by the Partnership from time to time in connection with asset acquisitions or other business combination transactions. During 2017, the Partnership issued 1,604,343 common units in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by certain Contribution, Exchange and Purchase Agreements dated June 28, 2017. At present, 6,395,657 units remain available under the Partnership’s registration statements on Form S-4. Regulation Many aspects of the production, pricing and marketing of crude oil and natural gas are regulated by federal and state agencies. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, which frequently increases the regulatory burden on affected members of the industry. Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes: ●     permits for the drilling of wells;●     bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells;●     the location and number of wells;●     the method of drilling and completing wells;●     the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;●     the plugging and abandonment of wells;●     numerous federal and state safety requirements;●     environmental requirements;●     property taxes and severance taxes; and●     specific state and federal income tax provisions. Oil and natural gas operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish a maximum allowable production from oil and natural gas wells. These state laws also generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. These regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas that the operators of our properties can produce. The transportation of oil and natural gas after sale by operators of our properties is sometimes subject to regulation by state authorities. The interstate transportation of oil and natural gas is subject to federal governmental regulation, including regulation of tariffs and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Customers and Pricing The pricing of oil and natural gas sales is primarily determined by supply and demand in the marketplace and can fluctuate considerably. As a royalty owner and non-operator, we have extremely limited access to timely information, involvement, and operational control over the volumes of oil and natural gas produced and sold and the terms and conditions on which such volumes are marketed and sold. 2Table of Contents The operating partnership sells its Oklahoma Hugoton field natural gas production to DCP Midstream, LP, a gas processor and purchaser under a processing and purchase agreement. The agreement is automatically renewed annually unless cancelled by either party. We believe that the loss of DCP Midstream, LP or any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on us due to the availability of alternative purchasers in the area. Competition The energy industry in which we compete is subject to intense competition among many companies, both larger and smaller than we are, many of which have financial and other resources greater than we have. Business Opportunities Agreement Pursuant to a business opportunities agreement among us, our general partner, the general partner of our general partner, and the owners of the general partner of our general partner (the “GP Parties”), we have agreed that, except with the consent of our general partner, which it may withhold in its sole discretion, we will not engage in any business not permitted by our partnership agreement, and we will have no interest or expectancy in any business opportunity that does not consist exclusively of the oil and natural gas business within a designated area that includes portions of Texas County, Oklahoma and Stevens County, Kansas. All opportunities that are outside the designated area or are not oil and natural gas business activities are called renounced opportunities. The parties also have agreed that, as long as the activities of the general partner, the GP Parties and their affiliates or manager designees are conducted in accordance with specified standards, or are renounced opportunities:  ● our general partner, the GP Parties and their affiliates or the manager designees will not be prohibited from engaging in the oil and natural gas business or any other business, even if such activity is in direct or indirect competition with our business activities;    ●affiliates of our general partner, the GP Parties and their affiliates and the manager designees will not have to offer us any business opportunity;  ●we will have no interest or expectancy in any business opportunity pursued by affiliates of our general partner, the GP Parties or their affiliates and the manager designees; and  ●we waive any claim that any business opportunity pursued by our general partner, the GP Parties or their affiliates and the manager designees constitutes a corporate opportunity that should have been presented to us. The standards specified in the business opportunities agreement generally provide that the GP Parties and their affiliates and manager designees must conduct their business through the use of their own personnel and assets and not with the use of any personnel or assets of us, our general partner or operating partnership. A manager designee or personnel of a company in which any affiliate of our general partner or any GP Party or their affiliates has an interest or in which a manager designee is an owner, director, manager, partner or employee (except for our general partner and its general partner and their subsidiaries) is not allowed to usurp a business opportunity solely for his or her personal benefit, as opposed to pursuing, for the benefit of the separate party an opportunity in accordance with the specified standards. In certain circumstances, if a GP Party or any subsidiary thereof, any officer of the general partner of our general partner or any of their subsidiaries, or a manager of the general partner of our general partner that is an affiliate of a GP Party signs a binding agreement to purchase oil and natural gas interests, excluding oil and natural gas working interests, then such party must notify us prior to the consummation of the transactions so that we may determine whether to pursue the purchase of the oil and natural gas interests directly from the seller. If we do not pursue the purchase of the oil and natural gas interests or fail to respond to the purchasing party's notice within the provided time, the opportunity will also be considered a renounced opportunity. In the event any GP Party or one of their subsidiaries acquires an oil and natural gas interest, including oil and natural gas working interests, in the designated area, it will offer to sell these interests to us within one month of completing the acquisition. This obligation also applies to any package of oil and natural gas interests, including oil and natural gas working interests, if at least 20% of the net acreage of the package is within the designated area; however, this obligation does not apply to interests purchased in a transaction in which the procedures described above were applied and followed by the applicable affiliate. 3Table of Contents Operating Hazards and Uninsured Risks Our operations do not directly involve the operational risks and uncertainties associated with drilling for, and the production and transportation of, oil and natural gas. However, we may be indirectly affected by the operational risks and uncertainties faced by the operators of our properties, including the operating partnership, whose operations may be materially curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including: ●     the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations; ●     accidents; ●     title problems; ●     weather conditions; ●     compliance with governmental requirements; and ●     shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. Also, the ability of the operators of our properties to market oil and natural gas production depends on numerous factors, many of which are beyond their control, including: ●     capacity and availability of oil and natural gas systems and pipelines; ●     effect of federal and state production and transportation regulations; ●     changes in supply and demand for oil and natural gas; and ●     creditworthiness of the purchasers of oil and natural gas. The occurrence of an operational risk or uncertainty that materially impacts the operations of the operators of our properties could have a material adverse effect on the amount that we receive in connection with our interests in production from our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operations. In accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks to which our business exposes us. While we believe that we are reasonably insured against these risks, the occurrence of an uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Employees  As of February 28, 2019, the operating partnership had 25 full-time employees in our Dallas, Texas office and six full-time employees in field locations. ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:  ●the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;    ●the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;    ●political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;  ●the price and level of foreign imports;    ●the level of consumer demand;    ●the price and availability of alternative fuels;    ●the availability of pipeline capacity;    ●weather conditions;    ●domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and    ●the overall economic environment. Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders. 4Table of Contents We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the operating partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The operating partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The operating partnership and the other current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. The operating partnership can sell any of the properties underlying the NPIs that it operates and relinquish the ability to control or influence operations. Any such sale or transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. The operating partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our general partner, through the operating partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The operating partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, some of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Some of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. Many of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. In addition, development possibilities by the operating partnership in the Hugoton field are limited by the developed nature of that field and by regulatory restrictions. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of operating cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our general partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our general partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration. 5Table of Contents Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The operating partnership may undertake drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our other properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: ●     pressure or irregularities in formations;●     equipment failures or accidents;●     unexpected drilling conditions;●     shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;●     adverse weather conditions; and●     disputes with drill-site owners. Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests or cash proceeds of a securities offering. Because of the limitations on our use of operating cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate operating cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions by first selling our securities to raise cash or by issuing our limited partnership interests. However, may be unable to sell our securities in sufficient quantities and for sufficient consideration to provide adequate consideration to fund an acquisition, and sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our general partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our general partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our general partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives. 6Table of Contents A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are natural gas properties located in the Hugoton field in Oklahoma. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. The number of prospective natural gas purchasers and methods of delivery are considerably less than would otherwise exist from a more geographically diverse group of properties. As a result, natural gas sales after gathering and compression tend to be sold to one buyer, thereby increasing credit risk. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the operating partnership. Damages associated with the production and gathering of our oil and natural gas properties could affect our cash flow. The operating partnership owns and operates gathering systems and compression facilities. Casualty losses or damages from these operations would be production costs under the terms of the NPIs and could adversely affect our cash flow. We may indirectly experience costs from repair or replacement of aging equipment. Some of the operating partnership's current working interest wells were drilled and have been producing since prior to 1954. The 132-mile Oklahoma gas pipeline gathering system was originally installed in or about 1948 and because of its age is in need of periodic repairs and upgrades. Should major components of this system require significant repairs or replacement, the operating partnership may incur substantial capital expenditures in the operation of the Oklahoma properties, which, as production costs, would reduce our cash flow from these properties. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the operating partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, in Oklahoma, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, regulators have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future. As another example, Oklahoma regulations currently require administrative hearings to change the concentration of the operating partnership’s gas production wells from one well for each 640 acres in the Guymon-Hugoton field. Previously, certain interested parties have sought regulatory changes in Oklahoma for ""infill,"" or increased density drilling. Should Oklahoma change its existing regulations to readily permit infill drilling, it is possible that a number of producers will commence increased density drilling in areas adjacent to the properties in Oklahoma that are subject to the NPIs. If the operating partnership or other operators of our properties do not do the same, our production levels relating to these properties may decrease, or mineral owners may demand increased density drilling. Capital expenditures relating to increased density on the properties underlying the NPIs would be deducted from amounts payable to us under the NPIs. 7Table of Contents Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks. We increasingly rely on information technology systems to operate our business and the oil and gas industry depends on digital technologies in exploration, development, production, and processing activities. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of the operators of our properties, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of its business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for some period of time. While we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate exposure to such risk, cyber incidents and attacks are evolving and unpredictable. Our information technology systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised in a cyber attack. Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation could reduce the amount we would receive from our properties. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain materials that are commonly used in connection with oil and gas operations are considered to be hazardous substances under CERCLA. Responsible persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site, regardless of whether the disposal of hazardous substances was lawful at the time of the disposal. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of these costs. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and many other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority. The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements, such as emissions controls. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from oil and gas facilities. Specifically, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final regulations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”) for the oil and natural gas source category. These regulations are designed to reduce volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from hydraulically fractured wells and other equipment. Under the regulations, since January 1, 2015 owners and operators of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells (wells drilled principally for the production of natural gas) have been required to use reduced emissions (“green”) completion technology to recover natural gas that formerly would have been flared or vented. On May 12, 2016, the EPA issued a suite of new final regulations, known as ""NSPS Subpart OOOOa,"" designed to limit methane and VOC emissions. Among other things, these new rules apply green completion requirements to newly fractured and refractured oil wells.  NSPS Subpart OOOOa and EPA’s subsequent actions to reconsider and propose stays of the rules have been heavily litigated and, in October 2018, the EPA released proposed revisions to some of the 2016 requirements, including reducing the required frequency of fugitive emissions monitoring at well sites and compressor stations. Accordingly, the ultimate scope of these regulations is uncertain, and obtaining permits and complying with these new requirements has the potential to increase costs of production and delay the development of our properties. 8Table of Contents In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final version of its venting and flaring rule, which imposes stricter reporting obligations and limits venting and flaring of natural gas on federal and Indian lands. Some provisions of the venting and flaring rule went into effect on January 17, 2017. The BLM subsequently announced that it was postponing until January 17, 2019, the implementation of other aspects of the venting and flaring rule, which were originally scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 2018. Then, in February, 2018, the BLM issued a proposed rule which would rescind, modify, and retain portions of the November 2016 rule.  And in September 2018, the BLM announced a final rule that revises the 2016 rule, which was immediately followed by litigation challenging the agency’s actions.  In March 2015, the BLM released its new regulations governing hydraulic fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming temporarily stayed implementation of this rule in June 2016, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit later lifted the lower court’s stay on the basis that the BLM had proposed to rescind the rule in June 2017.  In December 2017, the BLM repealed the 2015 regulations, and environmental organizations and the State of California are suing the BLM and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior over the repeal. Each of these regulations, to the extent that they are reinstated or modified, may result in additional levels of regulation or complexity that could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase costs of compliance. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act” or “CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“USACOE”). In May 2015, EPA and the USACOE jointly announced a final rule defining the “Waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”), which are protected under the Clean Water Act. The new rule, which would have made additional waters expressly Waters of the United States and, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, rather than subject to a case-specific evaluation, was stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit before it took effect. On February 1, 2018, EPA officially delayed implementation of the 2015 rule until early 2020, and in July 2018, the EPA proposed repeal of the 2015 WOTUS rule. Later that year, EPA’s decision was challenged in court, which resulted in a decision by the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina to enjoin EPA’s February 2018 delay rule.  Several states then acted to halt reinstatement of the 2015 WOTUS rule, the effect of all of which is that the 2015 WOTUS definition is currently in effect in 22 states. Then in December 2018, the EPA and the USACOE issued a proposed rule to revise the definition of “Waters of the United States.”  The proposed rule would narrow the definition, excluding, for example, streams that do not flow year-round and wetlands without a direct surface connection to other jurisdictional waters. Litigation by parties opposing the rule quickly followed. Due to the administrative procedures required to establish the rule and pending litigation, the new definition of “Waters of the United States” may not be implemented, if at all, for several years.  Regardless, compliance with the Clean Water Act may restrict the location of certain facilities, require the mitigation of impacted wetlands, increase the cost of capital expenditures, and may result in permitting delays. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (“SPCC”) regulations promulgated under the Clean Water Act and later amended by the Oil Pollutions Act of 1990 impose obligations and liabilities related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills into or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities that store oil in more than threshold quantities, the release of which could reasonably be expected to reach jurisdictional waters, must develop, implement, and maintain SPCC Plans. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program require that permits be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring be conducted periodically to ensure that the disposed waters are not leaking into groundwater. In addition, because some states have become concerned that the injection or disposal of produced water could, under certain circumstances, trigger or contribute to seismic activity, they have adopted or are considering additional regulations regarding such disposal methods. Changes in regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect the ability of the operators of the Royalty Properties and the operators of the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs to dispose of produced water and ultimately increase the cost of operation of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs or delay production schedules. For example, in 2014, the Railroad Commission of Texas (“RRC”) published a final rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the RRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. In addition, several cases have recently put a spotlight on the issue of whether injection wells may be regulated under the Clean Water Act if a direct hydrological connection to a jurisdictional surface water can be established. The split among federal circuit courts of appeals that decided these cases engendered two petitions for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court in August 2018, one of which was granted in February 2019. EPA has also brought attention to the reach of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction in such instances by issuing a request for comment in February 2018 regarding the applicability of the Clean Water Act permitting program to discharges into groundwater with a direct hydrological connection to jurisdictional surface water, which hydrological connections should be considered “direct,” and whether such discharges would be better addressed through other federal or state programs. To date, no further action has been taken by EPA with respect to the issue, but should Clean Water Act permitting be required for saltwater injections wells, the costs of permitting and compliance for the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs could increase. Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds and their habitat, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the CWA, and CERCLA. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of, or harm to, species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to restrict or prevent oil and gas exploration or production activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or production activities, including, for example, for releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and may seek natural resources damages and, in some cases, criminal penalties. 9Table of Contents Operations of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs may be subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes and their implementing regulations. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, the general duty clause and Risk Management Planning regulations promulgated under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and similar state statutes may require disclosure of information about hazardous materials used, produced or otherwise managed during operation of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs. These laws also require the development of risk management plans for certain facilities to prevent accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of such releases should they occur. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal regulation under the SDWA, provided that diesel fuel is not used in the fracturing process. In prior Congressional Sessions, legislation has been introduced that would have repealed this exemption. If similar legislation were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In 2010, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives through an informal policy statement posted on the agency’s website. Industry groups filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA’s decision. In February 2012, the EPA and industry reached a settlement under which the EPA agreed to issue hydraulic fracturing permitting guidance through the notice and comment process. The EPA published a draft guidance document in May 2012, and accepted comments through August 2012. In February 2014, the EPA published final guidance that broadly defined diesel fuel and which requires the issuance of a Class II Underground Injection Control permit for hydraulic fracturing treatments using diesel fuel. These requirements may cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process using diesel fuel. The EPA has also asserted in certain cases involving alleged groundwater contamination that it has emergency authority under the SDWA to issue administrative compliance orders to require clean-up of groundwater. Although the United States Supreme Court has held that such orders are subject to pre-enforcement judicial review, the EPA maintains that it has the authority to continue to issue such orders. The EPA’s Office of Research and Development (“ORD”) has conducted a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The ORD published a report in 2016, concluding that hydraulic fracturing operations do impact drinking water resources under some circumstances but declining to reach conclusions about the frequency or severity of those impacts. In addition to the EPA study, there are other governmental reviews that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. In April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order establishing an interagency working group to coordinate Federal policies related to unconventional gas development. In addition, a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. These or other investigations, initiatives, and studies could result in additional efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing. Beyond studying hydraulic fracturing, certain members of Congress have called upon the Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing. Any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing resulting from these efforts could result in delays, additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, and more stringent construction requirements, thereby significantly increasing operating, capital and compliance costs. Such cost increases could delay or restrict development by operators of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In response to a 2014 ballot initiative by the voters of the City of Denton, Texas banning hydraulic fracturing, the Texas legislature enacted a statute preempting local government regulation of oil and gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing. In other states, however, local governments may retain the ability to directly or indirectly regulate hydraulic fracturing. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties complying with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells. 10Table of Contents The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress or executive orders or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, such as a resolution referred to as the Green New Deal, which was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in February 2019. To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation. Almost half of the states, however, have developed GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. These cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment by contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA required the agency to adopt regulations to restrict GHG emissions under the Federal Clean Air Act. In 2010, the EPA issued a final rule “tailoring” its New Source Review permitting and Federal Operating Permit programs to apply to facilities with certain thresholds of GHG emissions. This “Tailoring Rule” was challenged in court, and on June 23, 2014, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Tailoring Rule in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency. In its decision, the Court held that the EPA may not impose permitting requirements on facilities based solely on their emissions of GHGs. But, the Court also held that the EPA may regulate GHG emissions if a facility is otherwise subject to permitting based on the emissions of conventional, non-GHG pollutants. Thus, any new facilities or major modifications to existing facilities that exceed the federal New Source Review emission thresholds for conventional pollutants may be required to use “best available control technology” and energy efficiency measures to minimize GHG emissions. In December 2010, the EPA enacted final regulations on mandatory reporting of GHGs. Those regulations required owners or operators of facilities that contain petroleum and natural gas systems and emit 25,000 metric tons or more of GHGs per year (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2E) to annually report carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, beginning in September 2012. The EPA has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future GHG emission limits. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, or whether EPA may promulgate additional regulation of GHGs from the oil and gas industry, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require the operating partnership and oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from the Royalty Properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. 11Table of Contents Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our general partner, and their ability to remove our general partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our general partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our general partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our general partner on an annual or any other basis. Our general partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our general partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our general partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our general partner relating to their interests in our general partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our general partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our general partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of general partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our general partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our general partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our general partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 40% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. 12Table of Contents Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our general partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, Bradley J. Ehrman, its Chief Operating Officer and Leslie A. Moriyama, its Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain. Tax Risks  The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should, therefore, consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and general partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 2013 we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI and the Maecenas NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flow. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) that makes significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws.  Among other changes, the Tax Act (i) introduces a new deduction on certain pass-through income, (ii) repeals the partnership technical termination rule and (iii) imposes a new limitation on the deductibility of interest expense.  Many of the provisions in the Tax Act, including the deduction related to certain pass-through income, are temporary and, without additional legislation, will sunset on December 31, 2025. The Tax Act is complex, and, while some proposed administrative guidance and finalized administrative guidance has been released, there is still forthcoming administrative guidance.  Thus, the impact of certain aspects of its provisions on us or an investment in our common units may be unclear.  We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a ""qualifying income"" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. However, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other matter affecting us. A change in our business or a change in current law (including administrative guidance relating to the Tax Act) could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21%. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Several states have subjected, or are evaluating ways to subject, partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation or the assessment of a material amount of entity-level taxation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. 13Table of Contents As stated above, we have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the IRS as to our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to challenge our federal income tax status, such a challenge could result in an audit of our unitholders’ tax returns and adjustments to items on their tax returns that are unrelated to their ownership of our common units. In addition, our unitholders would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of their personal tax returns. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.  The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, the President and members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Additionally, on January 19, 2017, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury publicly released the text of final regulations (the “Final Regulations”) regarding qualifying income under Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Code, which provide that income earned from a royalty interest is qualifying income. On January 24, 2017, the Final Regulations were published in the Federal Register. Under current law, we believe that our royalty income is qualifying income for purposes of Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Code. If the Final Regulations remain effective in their current form, we believe we will continue to be able to meet the qualifying income requirement under the new rules. However, there are no assurances that the Final Regulations will not be revised to take a position that is contrary to our interpretation of the current law. While the Tax Act does not negatively impact the Final Regulations or the qualifying income exception, we are unable to predict whether any changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted or adopted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. The recently enacted 20% deduction for certain pass-through income may not be available for our unitholders’ allocable share of our net income, in which case our unitholders’ tax liability with respect to ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available.  Pursuant to the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or before December 31, 2025, an individual taxpayer may generally claim a deduction in the amount of 20% of its allocable share of certain publicly traded partnership income, including generally, among other items, the net amount of its items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a publicly traded partnership’s U.S. trade or business. Because we own only non-operated, passive mineral and royalty interests, we may not be viewed as engaged in a U.S. trade or business within the meaning of the new law. Therefore, most or all of the income that we now generate, or will generate in the future, may not be “qualifying publicly traded partnership income” eligible for the 20% deduction. Thus, our unitholders may not be able to claim the 20% deduction on any income allocated from us, and any such claim may be successfully challenged by the IRS. If the deduction is not available, our unitholders’ tax liability from ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. We urge our unitholders to consult with their tax advisors regarding the availability of the 20% deduction on any income allocated from us. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if this method is determined to be an unreasonable method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction would be reallocated among our unitholders and our general partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. 14Table of Contents Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Internal Revenue Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may have to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our general partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our general partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the operating partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Our unitholders may be subject to withholding tax upon transfers of their common units. Pursuant to the Tax Act, if a unitholder sells or otherwise disposes of a common unit, the transferee is required to withhold 10% of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person, and we are required to deduct and withhold from distributions to the transferee amounts that should have been withheld by the transferee but were not withheld. However, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS have determined that this withholding requirement should not apply to any disposition of a publicly traded interest in a publicly traded partnership (such as us) until regulations or other guidance have been issued clarifying the application of this withholding requirement to dispositions of interests in publicly traded partnerships. Accordingly, while this new withholding requirement does not currently apply to interests in us, there can be no assurance that such requirement will not apply in the future. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the operating partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the operating partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if he qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, he generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Internal Revenue Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest in the partnership must be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by United States Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. 15Table of Contents Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our general partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors including: (i) the amount of taxable income recognized by us; (ii) the amount of any gain recognized by us that is attributable to specific asset sales that may be wholly or partially attributable to Built-in Gain and the resulting allocation of such gain to a unitholder, depending on the asset being sold; (iii) the amount of basis adjustment pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code available to a unitholder based on the purchase price for any common units and the amount by which such price was greater or less than a unitholder’s proportionate share of inside tax basis of our assets attributable to the common units when the common units were purchased; and (iv) the method of depletion available to a unitholder. Therefore, it is not possible for us to predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if he lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, he may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. If we are not notified (either directly or through a broker) of a sale or other transfer of common units, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to such units may not be provided to the purchaser or other transferee of the units and may instead continue to be provided to the original transferor. If our transfer agent or any other nominee holding common units on behalf of a partner is not timely notified of a sale or other transfer of common units, and a proper transfer of ownership is not recorded on the appropriate books and records, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to these common units may not be made or provided to the transferee of the units and may instead continue to be made or provided to the original transferor. Notwithstanding a transferee's failure to receive distributions and federal income tax information or reports from us with respect to these units, the IRS may contend that such transferee is a partner for federal income tax purposes and that some allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferee. Alternatively, the IRS may contend that the transferor continues to be a partner for federal income tax purposes and that allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferor. If the transferor is not treated as a partner for federal income tax purposes, any cash distributions received by such transferor with respect to the transferred units following the transfer would be fully taxable as ordinary income to the transferor. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where he resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We generally will have the ability to shift any such tax liability to our general partner and our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. If we are unable to have our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the economic burden resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit.  If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. 16Table of Contents Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.

BUSINESS General Dorchester Minerals, L.P. is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership that commenced operations on January 31, 2003, upon the combination of Dorchester Hugoton, Ltd., Republic Royalty Company, L.P. and Spinnaker Royalty Company, L.P. Dorchester Hugoton was a publicly traded Texas limited partnership, and Republic and Spinnaker were private Texas limited partnerships. Our common units are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. American Stock Transfer & Trust Company is our registrar and transfer agent and its address and telephone number is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219, (800) 937-5449. Our executive offices are located at 3838 Oak Lawn Avenue, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas, 75219-4541, and our telephone number is (214) 559-0300. We have established a website at www.dmlp.net that contains the last annual meeting presentation and a link to the NASDAQ website. You may obtain all current filings free of charge at our website. We will provide electronic or paper copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) free of charge upon written request at our executive offices. In this report, the term ""Partnership,"" as well as the terms ""us,"" ""our,"" ""we,"" and ""its"" are sometimes used as abbreviated references to Dorchester Minerals, L.P. itself or Dorchester Minerals, L.P. and its related entities. Our general partner is Dorchester Minerals Management LP, which is managed by its general partner, Dorchester Minerals Management GP LLC. As a result, the Board of Managers of Dorchester Minerals Management GP LLC exercises effective control of our Partnership. In this report, the term ""general partner"" is used as an abbreviated reference to Dorchester Minerals Management LP. Our general partner also controls and owns, directly and indirectly, all of the partnership interests in Dorchester Minerals Operating LP and its general partner. Dorchester Minerals Operating LP owns working interests and other properties underlying our Net Profits Interests (or “NPIs”), provides day-to-day operational and administrative services to us and our general partner, and is the employer of all the employees who perform such services. In this report, the term ""operating partnership"" is used as an abbreviated reference to Dorchester Minerals Operating LP.  Our general partner and the operating partnership are Delaware limited partnerships, and the general partners of their general partners are Delaware limited liability companies. These entities and our Partnership were initially formed in December 2001 in connection with the combination. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Dorchester Minerals Oklahoma LP and its general partner are Oklahoma entities that acquired our wholly owned acquisition subsidiary and its general partner by merger on December 31, 2009. On March 31, 2010, we formed a new subsidiary, and it acquired all of the outstanding partnership interests in Maecenas Minerals LLP, a Texas limited liability partnership. Our business may be described as the acquisition, ownership and administration of Royalty Properties and NPIs. The Royalty Properties consist of producing and nonproducing mineral, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits, and leasehold interests located in 574 counties and parishes in 25 states (“Royalty Properties”). The NPIs represent net profits overriding royalty interests in various properties owned by the operating partnership. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute quarterly an amount equal to all funds that we receive from the Royalty Properties and the NPIs less certain expenses and reasonable reserves. Our partnership agreement allows us to grow by acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties, subject to the limitations described below. The approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common units is required for our general partner to cause us to acquire or obtain any oil and natural gas property interest, unless the acquisition is complementary to our business and is made either:  ● in exchange for our limited partner interests, including common units, not exceeding 20% of the common units outstanding after issuance; or  ●in exchange for cash, if the aggregate cost of any acquisitions made for cash during the twelve-month period ending on the first to occur of the execution of a definitive agreement for the acquisition or its consummation is no more than 10% of our aggregate cash distributions for the four most recent fiscal quarters. Unless otherwise approved by the holders of a majority of our common units, in the event that we acquire properties for a combination of cash and limited partner interests, including common units, (i) the cash component of the acquisition consideration must be equal to or less than 5% of the aggregate cash distributions made by our Partnership for the four most recent quarters and (ii) the amount of limited partnership interests, including common units, to be issued in such acquisition, after giving effect to such issuance, shall not exceed 10% of the common units outstanding. 1Table of Contents Credit Facilities and Financing Plans We do not have a credit facility in place, nor do we anticipate doing so. We do not anticipate incurring any debt, other than trade debt incurred in the ordinary course of our business. Our partnership agreement prohibits us from incurring indebtedness, other than trade payables, (i) in excess of $50,000 in the aggregate at any given time; or (ii) which would constitute ""acquisition indebtedness"" (as defined in Section 514 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), in order to avoid unrelated business taxable income for federal income tax purposes. We may finance any growth of our business through acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties by issuing additional limited partnership interests or with cash, subject to the limits described above and in our partnership agreement. Under our partnership agreement, we may also finance our growth through the issuance of additional partnership securities, including options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights with respect to partnership securities from time to time in exchange for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our general partner in its sole discretion. However, we may not issue limited partnership interests that would represent over 20% of the outstanding limited partnership interests immediately after giving effect to such issuance or that would have greater rights or powers than our common units without the approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common units. Except in connection with qualifying acquisitions, we do not currently anticipate issuing additional partnership securities. We have effective registration statements on Form S-4 registering an aggregate of 8,000,000 common units that may be offered and issued by the Partnership from time to time in connection with asset acquisitions or other business combination transactions. During 2017, the Partnership issued 1,604,343 common units in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by that certain Contribution, Exchange and Purchase Agreement dated June 28, 2017 between the Partnership and DSD Royalty, LLC and those certain Contribution and Exchange Agreements dated June 30, 2017 between the Partnership and each of 1307, Ltd., SCW Capital, LP, Tortuga Oil & Gas, L.P., Robert R. Penn, Squaretop Partners, L.P., Marshall Bryan Payne, MARI GST Non-Exempt Trust, Vaughn Petroleum (DMLP), LLC, James E. Raley, 2011 Pete & Kay Allen Family Trust, Leslie A. Moriyama, Rokeby Investments, L.P., Browning C. Vaughn, The MDIG PPM Trust, The MDIG WWM Trust, The MDIG AMM Trust, The MDIG SCM Trust and Quiscalus Ventures, LLC. At present, 6,395,657 units remain available under the Partnership’s registration statements on Form S-4. Regulation Many aspects of the production, pricing and marketing of crude oil and natural gas are regulated by federal and state agencies. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, which frequently increases the regulatory burden on affected members of the industry. Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes:  ● permits for the drilling of wells; ● bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; ● the location and number of wells; ● the method of drilling and completing wells; ● the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; ● the plugging and abandonment of wells; ● numerous federal and state safety requirements; ● environmental requirements; ● property taxes and severance taxes; and ● specific state and federal income tax provisions. Oil and natural gas operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish a maximum allowable production from oil and natural gas wells. These state laws also generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. These regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas that the operators of our properties can produce. The transportation of oil and natural gas after sale by operators of our properties is sometimes subject to regulation by state authorities. The interstate transportation of oil and natural gas is subject to federal governmental regulation, including regulation of tariffs and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   Customers and PricingThe pricing of oil and natural gas sales is primarily determined by supply and demand in the marketplace and can fluctuate considerably. As a royalty owner and non-operator, we have extremely limited access to timely information, involvement, and operational control over the volumes of oil and natural gas produced and sold and the terms and conditions on which such volumes are marketed and sold. The operating partnership sells its Oklahoma Hugoton field natural gas production to DCP Midstream, LP, a gas processor and purchaser under a processing and purchase agreement. The agreement is automatically renewed annually unless cancelled by either party. We believe that the loss of DCP Midstream, LP or any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on us due to the availability of alternative purchasers in the area. 2Table of Contents Competition The energy industry in which we compete is subject to intense competition among many companies, both larger and smaller than we are, many of which have financial and other resources greater than we have. Business Opportunities Agreement Pursuant to a business opportunities agreement among us, our general partner, the general partner of our general partner, and the owners of the general partner of our general partner (the “GP Parties”), we have agreed that, except with the consent of our general partner, which it may withhold in its sole discretion, we will not engage in any business not permitted by our partnership agreement, and we will have no interest or expectancy in any business opportunity that does not consist exclusively of the oil and natural gas business within a designated area that includes portions of Texas County, Oklahoma and Stevens County, Kansas. All opportunities that are outside the designated area or are not oil and natural gas business activities are called renounced opportunities.  The parties also have agreed that, as long as the activities of the general partner, the GP Parties and their affiliates or manager designees are conducted in accordance with specified standards, or are renounced opportunities:  ● our general partner, the GP Parties and their affiliates or the manager designees will not be prohibited from engaging in the oil and natural gas business or any other business, even if such activity is in direct or indirect competition with our business activities;  ●affiliates of our general partner, the GP Parties and their affiliates and the manager designees will not have to offer us any business opportunity;  ●we will have no interest or expectancy in any business opportunity pursued by affiliates of our general partner, the GP Parties or their affiliates and the manager designees; and  ●we waive any claim that any business opportunity pursued by our general partner, the GP Parties or their affiliates and the manager designees constitutes a corporate opportunity that should have been presented to us. The standards specified in the business opportunities agreement generally provide that the GP Parties and their affiliates and manager designees must conduct their business through the use of their own personnel and assets and not with the use of any personnel or assets of us, our general partner or operating partnership. A manager designee or personnel of a company in which any affiliate of our general partner or any GP Party or their affiliates has an interest or in which a manager designee is an owner, director, manager, partner or employee (except for our general partner and its general partner and their subsidiaries) is not allowed to usurp a business opportunity solely for his or her personal benefit, as opposed to pursuing, for the benefit of the separate party an opportunity in accordance with the specified standards. In certain circumstances, if a GP Party or any subsidiary thereof, any officer of the general partner of our general partner or any of their subsidiaries, or a manager of the general partner of our general partner that is an affiliate of a GP Party signs a binding agreement to purchase oil and natural gas interests, excluding oil and natural gas working interests, then such party must notify us prior to the consummation of the transactions so that we may determine whether to pursue the purchase of the oil and natural gas interests directly from the seller. If we do not pursue the purchase of the oil and natural gas interests or fail to respond to the purchasing party's notice within the provided time, the opportunity will also be considered a renounced opportunity. In the event any GP Party or one of their subsidiaries acquires an oil and natural gas interest, including oil and natural gas working interests, in the designated area, it will offer to sell these interests to us within one month of completing the acquisition. This obligation also applies to any package of oil and natural gas interests, including oil and natural gas working interests, if at least 20% of the net acreage of the package is within the designated area; however, this obligation does not apply to interests purchased in a transaction in which the procedures described above were applied and followed by the applicable affiliate. 3Table of Contents Operating Hazards and Uninsured Risks Our operations do not directly involve the operational risks and uncertainties associated with drilling for, and the production and transportation of, oil and natural gas. However, we may be indirectly affected by the operational risks and uncertainties faced by the operators of our properties, including the operating partnership, whose operations may be materially curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:  ● the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations;  ● accidents;  ● title problems;  ● weather conditions;  ● compliance with governmental requirements; and  ● shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. Also, the ability of the operators of our properties to market oil and natural gas production depends on numerous factors, many of which are beyond their control, including:  ● capacity and availability of oil and natural gas systems and pipelines;  ● effect of federal and state production and transportation regulations;  ● changes in supply and demand for oil and natural gas; and  ● creditworthiness of the purchasers of oil and natural gas. The occurrence of an operational risk or uncertainty that materially impacts the operations of the operators of our properties could have a material adverse effect on the amount that we receive in connection with our interests in production from our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operations. In accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks to which our business exposes us. While we believe that we are reasonably insured against these risks, the occurrence of an uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Employees  As of March 8, 2018, the operating partnership had 24 full-time employees in our Dallas, Texas office and six full-time employees in field locations. ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:  ● the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;  ● the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;  ●political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;  ●the price and level of foreign imports;    ●the level of consumer demand;    ●the price and availability of alternative fuels;    ●the availability of pipeline capacity;    ●weather conditions; 4Table of Contents  ●domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and    ●the overall economic environment. Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders. We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the operating partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The operating partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The operating partnership and the other current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. The operating partnership can sell any of the properties underlying the NPIs that it operates and relinquish the ability to control or influence operations. Any such sale or transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. The operating partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our general partner, through the operating partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The operating partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, some of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Some of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. Many of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. In addition, development possibilities by the operating partnership in the Hugoton field are limited by the developed nature of that field and by regulatory restrictions. 5Table of Contents Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our general partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our general partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration. Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The operating partnership may undertake drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our other properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:  ● pressure or irregularities in formations; ● equipment failures or accidents; ● unexpected drilling conditions; ● shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment; ● adverse weather conditions; and ● disputes with drill-site owners. Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests. Because of the limitations on our use of cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions with our limited partnership interests. However, sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our general partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our general partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our general partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives. 6Table of Contents A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are natural gas properties located in the Hugoton field in Oklahoma. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. The number of prospective natural gas purchasers and methods of delivery are considerably less than would otherwise exist from a more geographically diverse group of properties. As a result, natural gas sales after gathering and compression tend to be sold to one buyer, thereby increasing credit risk. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the operating partnership. Damages associated with the production and gathering of our oil and natural gas properties could affect our cash flow. The operating partnership owns and operates gathering systems and compression facilities. Casualty losses or damages from these operations would be production costs under the terms of the NPIs and could adversely affect our cash flow. We may indirectly experience costs from repair or replacement of aging equipment. Some of the operating partnership's current working interest wells were drilled and have been producing since prior to 1954. The 132-mile Oklahoma gas pipeline gathering system was originally installed in or about 1948 and because of its age is in need of periodic repairs and upgrades. Should major components of this system require significant repairs or replacement, the operating partnership may incur substantial capital expenditures in the operation of the Oklahoma properties, which, as production costs, would reduce our cash flow from these properties. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the operating partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, in Oklahoma, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, regulators have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future. 7Table of Contents As another example, Oklahoma regulations currently require administrative hearings to change the concentration of the operating partnership’s gas production wells from one well for each 640 acres in the Guymon-Hugoton field. Previously, certain interested parties have sought regulatory changes in Oklahoma for ""infill,"" or increased density drilling similar to that which is available in Kansas, which allows one well for each 320 acres. Should Oklahoma change its existing regulations to readily permit infill drilling, it is possible that a number of producers will commence increased density drilling in areas adjacent to the properties in Oklahoma that are subject to the NPIs. If the operating partnership or other operators of our properties do not do the same, our production levels relating to these properties may decrease, or mineral owners may demand increased density drilling. Capital expenditures relating to increased density on the properties underlying the NPIs would be deducted from amounts payable to us under the NPIs. Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation could reduce the amount we would receive from our properties. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain materials that are commonly used in connection with oil and gas operations are considered to be hazardous substances under CERCLA. Responsible persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site, regardless of whether the disposal of hazardous substances was lawful at the time of the disposal. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of these costs. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and many other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority.  The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements, such as emissions controls. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from oil and gas facilities. Specifically, on August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final regulations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”). These regulations are designed to reduce volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from hydraulically fractured wells and other equipment. Under the regulations, since January 1, 2015 owners and operators of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells (wells drilled principally for the production of natural gas) have been required to use reduced emissions (“green”) completion technology to recover natural gas that formerly would have been flared or vented. On May 12, 2016, the EPA issued a suite of new final regulations designed to limit methane and VOC emissions. Among other things, these new rules apply green completion requirements to newly fractured and refractured oil wells. Obtaining permits and complying with these new requirements has the potential to increase costs of production and delay the development of our properties.  8Table of Contents In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final version of its venting and flaring rule, which imposes stricter reporting obligations and limits venting and flaring of natural gas on federal and Indian lands. Some provisions of the venting and flaring rule went into effect on January 17, 2017. The BLM has announced that it is postponing until January 17, 2019, the implementation of other aspects of the venting and flaring rule, which were originally scheduled to come into effect on January 1, 2018. And, on February 22, 2018, the BLM issued a proposed rule which would rescind, modify, and retain portions of the November 2016 rule. In March 2015, the BLM released its new regulations governing hydraulic fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule and a final decision is pending. In December 2017, the BLM repealed the 2015 regulations, and environmental organizations and the State of California are suing the BLM and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior over the repeal. Each of these regulations, to the extent that they are reinstated or modified, may result in additional levels of regulation or complexity that could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase costs of compliance. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In May 2015, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jointly announced a final rule defining the “Waters of the United States, “ which are protected under the Clean Water Act. The new rule, which would have made additional waters expressly Waters of the United States and, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, rather than subject to a case-specific evaluation, was stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit before it took effect. On February 1, 2018, EPA officially delayed implementation of the 2015 rule until early 2020. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA could initiate rulemaking to revise the definition of “Waters of the United States.” Compliance with the Clean Water Act may restrict the location of certain facilities, require the mitigation of impacted wetlands, increase the cost of capital expenditures, and may result in permitting delays. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (“SPCC”) regulations promulgated under the Clean Water Act and later amended by the Oil Pollutions Act of 1990 impose obligations and liabilities related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills into or threatening waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. For example, operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities that store oil in more than threshold quantities, the release of which could reasonably be expected to reach jurisdictional waters, must develop, implement, and maintain SPCC Plans. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program require that permits be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring be conducted periodically to ensure that the disposed waters are not leaking into groundwater.  In addition, because some states have become concerned that the injection or disposal of produced water could, under certain circumstances, trigger or contribute to seismic activity, they have adopted or are considering additional regulations regarding such disposal methods.  Changes in regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect the ability of the operators of the Royalty Properties and the operators of the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs to dispose of produced water and ultimately increase the cost of operation of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs or delay production schedules.  For example, in 2014, the Railroad Commission of Texas (“RRC”) published a final rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question.  If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the RRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds and their habitat, wetlands, and natural resources.  These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the CWA, and CERCLA. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species.  A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development.  Where takings of, or harm to, species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to restrict or prevent oil and gas exploration or production activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or production activities, including, for example, for releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and may seek natural resources damages and, in some cases, criminal penalties. Operations of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs may be subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes and their implementing regulations.  The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes may require disclosure of information about hazardous materials used, produced or otherwise managed during operation of the Royalty Properties and the working interests and other properties underlying our NPIs.  These laws also require the development of risk management plans for certain facilities to prevent accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of such releases should they occur. 9Table of Contents The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal regulation under the SDWA, provided that diesel fuel is not used in the fracturing process. In prior Congressional Sessions, legislation has been introduced that would have repealed this exemption. If similar legislation were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In 2010, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives through an informal policy statement posted on the agency’s website. Industry groups filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA’s decision. In February 2012, the EPA and industry reached a settlement under which the EPA agreed to issue hydraulic fracturing permitting guidance through the notice and comment process. The EPA published a draft guidance document in May 2012, and accepted comments through August 2012. In February 2014, the EPA published final guidance that broadly defined diesel fuel and which requires the issuance of a Class II Underground Injection Control permit for hydraulic fracturing treatments using diesel fuel. These requirements may cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process using diesel fuel. The EPA has also asserted in certain cases involving alleged groundwater contamination that it has emergency authority under the SDWA to issue administrative compliance orders to require clean-up of groundwater. Although the United States Supreme Court has held that such orders are subject to pre-enforcement judicial review, the EPA maintains that it has the authority to continue to issue such orders. The EPA’s Office of Research and Development (“ORD”) has conducted a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The ORD published a report in 2016, concluding that hydraulic fracturing operations do impact drinking water resources under some circumstances but declining to reach conclusions about the frequency or severity of those impacts. In addition to the EPA study, there are other governmental reviews that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. In April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order establishing an interagency working group to coordinate Federal policies related to unconventional gas development. In addition, a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. These or other investigations, initiatives, and studies could result in additional efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing. Beyond studying hydraulic fracturing, certain members of Congress have called upon the Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing. Any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing resulting from these efforts could result in delays, additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, and more stringent construction requirements, thereby significantly increasing operating, capital and compliance costs. Such cost increases could delay or restrict development by operators of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In response to a 2014 ballot initiative by the voters of the City of Denton, Texas banning hydraulic fracturing, the Texas legislature enacted a statute preempting local government regulation of oil and gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing. In other states, however, local governments may retain the ability to directly or indirectly regulate hydraulic fracturing. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties complying with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells.      The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress or executive orders or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation. Almost half of the states, however, have developed GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. These cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. 10Table of Contents In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment by contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA required the agency to adopt regulations to restrict GHG emissions under the Federal Clean Air Act. In 2010, the EPA issued a final rule “tailoring” its New Source Review permitting and Federal Operating Permit programs to apply to facilities with certain thresholds of GHG emissions. This “Tailoring Rule” was challenged in court, and on June 23, 2014, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Tailoring Rule in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency. In its decision, the Court held that the EPA may not impose permitting requirements on facilities based solely on their emissions of GHGs. But, the Court also held that the EPA may regulate GHG emissions if a facility is otherwise subject to permitting based on the emissions of conventional, non-GHG pollutants. Thus, any new facilities or major modifications to existing facilities that exceed the federal New Source Review emission thresholds for conventional pollutants may be required to use “best available control technology” and energy efficiency measures to minimize GHG emissions. In December 2010, the EPA enacted final regulations on mandatory reporting of GHGs. Those regulations required owners or operators of facilities that contain petroleum and natural gas systems and emit 25,000 metric tons or more of GHGs per year (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2E) to annually report carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, beginning in September 2012. The EPA has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future GHG emission limits. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, or whether EPA may promulgate additional regulation of GHGs from the oil and gas industry, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require the operating partnership and oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from the Royalty Properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our general partner, and their ability to remove our general partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our general partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our general partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our general partner on an annual or any other basis. 11Table of Contents Our general partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our general partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our general partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our general partner relating to their interests in our general partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our general partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our general partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of general partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our general partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our general partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our general partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 20% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. 12Table of Contents We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our general partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, Bradley J. Ehrman, its Chief Operating Officer and Leslie A. Moriyama, its Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain. Tax Risks  The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should, therefore, consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and general partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 2013 we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI and the Maecenas NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flow. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) that makes significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws. Among other changes, the Tax Act (i) introduces a new deduction on certain pass-through income, (ii) repeals the partnership technical termination rule and (iii) imposes a new limitation on the deductibility of interest expense. Many of the provisions in the Tax Act, including the deduction related to certain pass-through income, are temporary and, without additional legislation, will sunset on December 31, 2025. The Tax Act is complex and lacks administrative guidance, thus, the impact of certain aspects of its provisions on us or an investment in our common units is currently unclear. There may be other material adverse effects resulting from the Tax Act that we have not identified and that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flow. We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a ""qualifying income"" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. However, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other matter affecting us. A change in our business or a change in current law (including administrative guidance relating to the Tax Act) could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.  If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21%. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Several states have subjected, or are evaluating ways to subject, partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation or the assessment of a material amount of entity-level taxation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.  13Table of Contents As stated above, we have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the IRS as to our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to challenge our federal income tax status, such a challenge could result in an audit of our unitholders’ tax returns and adjustments to items on their tax returns that are unrelated to their ownership of our common units. In addition, our unitholders would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of their personal tax returns. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.  The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, the President and members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.         Additionally, on January 19, 2017, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury publicly released the text of final regulations (the “Final Regulations”) regarding qualifying income under Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Code, which provide that income earned from a royalty interest is qualifying income. On January 24, 2017, the Final Regulations were published in the Federal Register. Under current law, we believe that our royalty income is qualifying income for purposes of Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Code. If the Final Regulations remain effective in their current form, we believe we will continue to be able to meet the qualifying income requirement under the new rules. However, there are no assurances that the Final Regulations will not be revised to take a position that is contrary to our interpretation of the current law.          While the Tax Act does not negatively impact the final regulations or the qualifying income exception, we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted or adopted, or whether final qualifying income regulations will materially change interpretations of the current law. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.  The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if this method is determined to be an unreasonable method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction would be reallocated among our unitholders and our general partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. 14Table of Contents Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Internal Revenue Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may have to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our general partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our general partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the operating partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the operating partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the operating partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if he qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, he generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Internal Revenue Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest in the partnership must be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by United States Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our general partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. 15Table of Contents The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors including: (i) the amount of taxable income recognized by us; (ii) the amount of any gain recognized by us that is attributable to specific asset sales that may be wholly or partially attributable to Built-in Gain and the resulting allocation of such gain to a unitholder, depending on the asset being sold; (iii) the amount of basis adjustment pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code available to a unitholder based on the purchase price for any common units and the amount by which such price was greater or less than a unitholder’s proportionate share of inside tax basis of our assets attributable to the common units when the common units were purchased; and (iv) the method of depletion available to a unitholder. Therefore, it is not possible for us to predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if he lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, he may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. If we are not notified (either directly or through a broker) of a sale or other transfer of common units, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to such units may not be provided to the purchaser or other transferee of the units and may instead continue to be provided to the original transferor. If our transfer agent or any other nominee holding common units on behalf of a partner is not timely notified of a sale or other transfer of common units, and a proper transfer of ownership is not recorded on the appropriate books and records, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to these common units may not be made or provided to the transferee of the units and may instead continue to be made or provided to the original transferor. Notwithstanding a transferee's failure to receive distributions and federal income tax information or reports from us with respect to these units, the IRS may contend that such transferee is a partner for federal income tax purposes and that some allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferee. Alternatively, the IRS may contend that the transferor continues to be a partner for federal income tax purposes and that allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferor. If the transferor is not treated as a partner for federal income tax purposes, any cash distributions received by such transferor with respect to the transferred units following the transfer would be fully taxable as ordinary income to the transferor. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where he resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.  Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We generally will have the ability to shift any such tax liability to our general partner and our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.

3,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2017-03-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:  ●the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;  ●the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;  ●political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;  ●the price and level of foreign imports;  ●the level of consumer demand;  ●the price and availability of alternative fuels;  ●the availability of pipeline capacity;  ●weather conditions;  ●domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and  ●the overall economic environment. Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders.   4  We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the operating partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The operating partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The operating partnership and the other current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. The operating partnership can sell any of the properties underlying the NPIs that it operates and relinquish the ability to control or influence operations. Any such sale or transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. The operating partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our general partner, through the operating partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The operating partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, some of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Some of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. Many of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. In addition, development possibilities by the operating partnership in the Hugoton field are limited by the developed nature of that field and by regulatory restrictions. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our general partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our general partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration.   5   Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The operating partnership may undertake drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our other properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: ●     pressure or irregularities in formations;●     equipment failures or accidents;●     unexpected drilling conditions;●     shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;●     adverse weather conditions; and●     disputes with drill-site owners. Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests. Because of the limitations on our use of cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions with our limited partnership interests. However, sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our general partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our general partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our general partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives.   6   A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are natural gas properties located in the Hugoton field in Oklahoma. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. The number of prospective natural gas purchasers and methods of delivery are considerably less than would otherwise exist from a more geographically diverse group of properties. As a result, natural gas sales after gathering and compression tend to be sold to one buyer, thereby increasing credit risk. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the operating partnership. Damages associated with the production and gathering of our oil and natural gas properties could affect our cash flow. The operating partnership owns and operates gathering systems and compression facilities. Casualty losses or damages from these operations would be production costs under the terms of the NPIs and could adversely affect our cash flow. We may indirectly experience costs from repair or replacement of aging equipment. Some of the operating partnership's current working interest wells were drilled and have been producing since prior to 1954. The 132-mile Oklahoma gas pipeline gathering system was originally installed in or about 1948 and because of its age is in need of periodic repairs and upgrades. Should major components of this system require significant repairs or replacement, the operating partnership may incur substantial capital expenditures in the operation of the Oklahoma properties, which, as production costs, would reduce our cash flow from these properties. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the operating partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, in Oklahoma, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, regulators have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future.   7   As another example, Oklahoma regulations currently require administrative hearings to change the concentration of the operating partnership’s gas production wells from one well for each 640 acres in the Guymon-Hugoton field. Previously, certain interested parties have sought regulatory changes in Oklahoma for ""infill,"" or increased density drilling similar to that which is available in Kansas, which allows one well for each 320 acres. Should Oklahoma change its existing regulations to readily permit infill drilling, it is possible that a number of producers will commence increased density drilling in areas adjacent to the properties in Oklahoma that are subject to the NPIs. If the operating partnership or other operators of our properties do not do the same, our production levels relating to these properties may decrease, or mineral owners may demand increased density drilling. Capital expenditures relating to increased density on the properties underlying the NPIs would be deducted from amounts payable to us under the NPIs. Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation could reduce the amount we would receive from our properties. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain hazardous substances are commonly used in connection with oil and gas operations. Responsible persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have been disposed. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority.  The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The EPA continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from oil and gas facilities. Specifically, on April 18, 2012, the EPA issued final regulations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”). These regulations are designed to reduce volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from hydraulically fractured wells and other equipment. Under the regulations, since January 1, 2015 owners and operators of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells (wells drilled principally for the production of natural gas) have been required to use so-called “green completion” technology to recover natural gas that formerly would have been flared or vented. On May 12, 2016, the EPA issued a suite of new final regulations designed to limit methane and voc emissions. Among other things, these new rules apply green completion requirements to newly fractured and refractured oil wells. Obtaining permits and complying with these new requirements has the potential to increase costs of production and delay the development of our properties.    8    The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Compliance with the Clean Water Act may restrict the location of certain facilities, require the mitigation of impacted wetlands, increase the cost of capital expenditures, and may result in permitting delays. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), provided that diesel fuel is not used in the fracturing process. In prior Congressional Sessions, legislation has been introduced that would have repealed this exemption. If similar legislation were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In 2010, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives through an informal policy statement posted on the agency’s website. Industry groups filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA’s decision. In February 2012, the EPA and industry reached a settlement under which the EPA agreed to issue hydraulic fracturing permitting guidance through the notice and comment process. The EPA published a draft guidance document in May 2012, and accepted comments through August 2012. In February 2014, the EPA published final guidance that broadly defined diesel fuel and which requires the issuance of a Class II Underground Injection Control permit for hydraulic fracturing treatments using diesel fuel. These requirements may cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process using diesel fuel.  The EPA has also asserted in certain cases involving alleged groundwater contamination that it has emergency authority under the SDWA to issue administrative compliance orders to require clean-up of groundwater. Although the United States Supreme Court has held that such orders are subject to pre-enforcement judicial review, the EPA maintains that it has the authority to continue to issue such orders. The EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) has conducted a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The ORD published draft results in 2015, concluding that hydraulic fracturing operations do impact drinking water resources but declining to reach conclusions about the frequency or severity of those impacts. In addition to the EPA study, there are other governmental reviews that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. In April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order establishing an interagency working group to coordinate Federal policies related to unconventional gas development. In addition, a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. These investigations, initiatives, and studies could result in additional efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing.  Beyond studying hydraulic fracturing, certain members of Congress have called upon the Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing. Any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing resulting from these efforts could result in delays, additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, and more stringent construction requirements, thereby significantly increasing operating, capital and compliance costs. Such cost increases could delay or restrict development by operators of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In response to a 2014 ballot initiative by the voters of the City of Denton, Texas banning hydraulic fracturing, the Texas legislature enacted a statute preempting local government regulation of oil and gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing. In other states, however, local governments may retain the ability to directly or indirectly regulate hydraulic fracturing. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties complying with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells.   9  The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress or executive orders or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation. Almost half of the states, however, have developed GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. These cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment by contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA required the agency to adopt regulations to restrict GHG emissions under the Federal Clean Air Act. In 2010, the EPA issued a final rule “tailoring” its New Source Review permitting and Federal Operating Permit programs to apply to facilities with certain thresholds of GHG emissions. This “Tailoring Rule” was challenged in court, and on June 23, 2014, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Tailoring Rule in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency. In its decision, the Court held that the EPA may not impose permitting requirements on facilities based solely on their emissions of GHGs. But, the Court also held that the EPA may regulate GHG emissions if a facility is otherwise subject to permitting based on the emissions of conventional, non-GHG pollutants. Thus, any new facilities or major modifications to existing facilities that exceed the federal New Source Review emission thresholds for conventional pollutants may be required to use “best available control technology” and energy efficiency measures to minimize GHG emissions. In December 2010, the EPA enacted final regulations on mandatory reporting of GHGs. Those regulations required owners or operators of facilities that contain petroleum and natural gas systems and emit 25,000 metric tons or more of GHGs per year (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2E) to annually report carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, beginning in September 2012. The EPA has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future GHG emission limits. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require the operating partnership and oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period.   10  Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our general partner, and their ability to remove our general partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our general partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our general partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our general partner on an annual or any other basis. Our general partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our general partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our general partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our general partner relating to their interests in our general partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our general partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our general partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of general partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our general partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our general partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our general partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 20% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution.   11  Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our general partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, Bradley J. Ehrman, its Chief Operating Officer and Leslie A. Moriyama, its Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain.  Tax Risks The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should, therefore, consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and general partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 2013 we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI and the Maecenas NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a ""qualifying income"" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. However, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other matter affecting us. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.  If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Several states have subjected, or are evaluating ways to subject, partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation or the assessment of a material amount of entity-level taxation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.  As stated above, we have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the IRS as to our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to challenge our federal income tax status, such a challenge could result in an audit of our unitholders’ tax returns and adjustments to items on their tax returns that are unrelated to their ownership of our common units. In addition, our unitholders would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of their personal tax returns.   12  The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.  The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, the President and members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.  Additionally, on May 5, 2015, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department issued proposed regulations (the “Proposed Regulations”) regarding qualifying income under Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Proposed Regulations provide an exclusive list of industry-specific rules regarding the qualifying income exception, but income earned from a royalty interest is not specifically enumerated as a qualifying income activity. On January 19, 2017, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury publicly released the text of final regulations (the “Final Regulations”) regarding qualifying income under Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Code, which were scheduled to be formally published in the Federal Register on January 24, 2017. The Final Regulations provide that income earned from a royalty interest is qualifying income. On January 20, 2017, the Trump administration released a memorandum that generally delayed all pending regulations from publication in the Federal Register pending review and approval (the “Regulatory Freeze”). On January 24, 2017, the Final Regulations were published in the Federal Register. Under current law, we believe that our royalty income is qualifying income for purposes of Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Code, notwithstanding the Proposed Regulations or the Regulatory Freeze. If the Final Regulations remain effective in their current form, we believe we will continue to be able to meet the qualifying income requirement under the new rules. However, there are no assurances that the Final Regulations will not be revised to take a position that is contrary to our interpretation of the current law.  We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted or adopted, or whether final qualifying income regulations will materially change interpretations of the current law. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.  The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if this method is determined to be an unreasonable method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction would be reallocated among our unitholders and our general partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS.   13  Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Internal Revenue Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may have to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our general partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our general partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the operating partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the operating partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the operating partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if he qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, he generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion.  Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Internal Revenue Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest in the partnership must be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by United States Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our general partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units.   14  The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors including: (i) the amount of taxable income recognized by us; (ii) the amount of any gain recognized by us that is attributable to specific asset sales that may be wholly or partially attributable to Built-in Gain and the resulting allocation of such gain to a unitholder, depending on the asset being sold; (iii) the amount of basis adjustment pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code available to a unitholder based on the purchase price for any common units and the amount by which such price was greater or less than a unitholder’s proportionate share of inside tax basis of our assets attributable to the common units when the common units were purchased; and (iv) the method of depletion available to a unitholder. Therefore, it is not possible for us to predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if he lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, he may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. If we are not notified (either directly or through a broker) of a sale or other transfer of common units, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to such units may not be provided to the purchaser or other transferee of the units and may instead continue to be provided to the original transferor. If our transfer agent or any other nominee holding common units on behalf of a partner is not timely notified of a sale or other transfer of common units, and a proper transfer of ownership is not recorded on the appropriate books and records, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to these common units may not be made or provided to the transferee of the units and may instead continue to be made or provided to the original transferor. Notwithstanding a transferee's failure to receive distributions and federal income tax information or reports from us with respect to these units, the IRS may contend that such transferee is a partner for federal income tax purposes and that some allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferee. Alternatively, the IRS may contend that the transferor continues to be a partner for federal income tax purposes and that allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferor. If the transferor is not treated as a partner for federal income tax purposes, any cash distributions received by such transferor with respect to the transferred units following the transfer would be fully taxable as ordinary income to the transferor.  A sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period could result in adverse tax consequences to a unitholder. We will terminate for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. A termination would result in the closing of our taxable year for a unitholder. As a result, if a unitholder has a different taxable year than we have, he may be required to include his allocable share of our income, gain, loss, deduction, credits and other items from both the taxable year ending prior to the year of our termination and the short taxable year ending at the time of our termination in the same taxable year. A termination also could result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination occurred. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where he resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us.   15   If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.  Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We generally will have the ability to shift any such tax liability to our general partner and our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.   Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.

7,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2016-02-25,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:  ●the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;  ●the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;  ●political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;  ●the price and level of foreign imports;  ●the level of consumer demand;  ●the price and availability of alternative fuels;  ●the availability of pipeline capacity;  ●weather conditions;  ●domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and  ●the overall economic environment. Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders.  4  We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the operating partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The operating partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The operating partnership and the other current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. The operating partnership can sell any of the properties underlying the NPIs that it operates and relinquish the ability to control or influence operations. Any such sale or transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. The operating partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our general partner, through the operating partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The operating partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, some of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Some of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. Many of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. In addition, development possibilities by the operating partnership in the Hugoton field are limited by the developed nature of that field and by regulatory restrictions. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our general partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our general partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration.  5  Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The operating partnership may undertake drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our other properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:  ●pressure or irregularities in formations; ●equipment failures or accidents; ●unexpected drilling conditions; ●shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment; ●adverse weather conditions; and ●disputes with drill-site owners. Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests. Because of the limitations on our use of cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions with our limited partnership interests. However, sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our general partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our general partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our general partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives.  6  A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are natural gas properties located in the Hugoton field in Oklahoma. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. The number of prospective natural gas purchasers and methods of delivery are considerably less than would otherwise exist from a more geographically diverse group of properties. As a result, natural gas sales after gathering and compression tend to be sold to one buyer, thereby increasing credit risk. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the operating partnership. Damages associated with the production and gathering of our oil and natural gas properties could affect our cash flow. The operating partnership owns and operates gathering systems and compression facilities. Casualty losses or damages from these operations would be production costs under the terms of the NPIs and could adversely affect our cash flow. We may indirectly experience costs from repair or replacement of aging equipment. Some of the operating partnership's current working interest wells were drilled and have been producing since prior to 1954. The 132-mile Oklahoma gas pipeline gathering system was originally installed in or about 1948 and because of its age is in need of periodic repairs and upgrades. Should major components of this system require significant repairs or replacement, the operating partnership may incur substantial capital expenditures in the operation of the Oklahoma properties, which, as production costs, would reduce our cash flow from these properties. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the operating partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, in Oklahoma, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, regulators have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future.  7  As another example, Oklahoma regulations currently require administrative hearings to change the concentration of the operating partnership’s gas production wells from one well for each 640 acres in the Guymon-Hugoton field. Previously, certain interested parties have sought regulatory changes in Oklahoma for ""infill,"" or increased density drilling similar to that which is available in Kansas, which allows one well for each 320 acres. Should Oklahoma change its existing regulations to readily permit infill drilling, it is possible that a number of producers will commence increased density drilling in areas adjacent to the properties in Oklahoma that are subject to the NPIs. If the operating partnership or other operators of our properties do not do the same, our production levels relating to these properties may decrease, or mineral owners may demand increased density drilling. Capital expenditures relating to increased density on the properties underlying the NPIs would be deducted from amounts payable to us under the NPIs. Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation could reduce the amount we would receive from our properties. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain hazardous substances are commonly used in connection with oil and gas operations. Responsible persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have been disposed. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority.  The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The EPA continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from oil and gas facilities. Specifically, on April 18, 2012, the EPA issued new final regulations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”). The new regulations are designed to reduce volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from hydraulically fractured wells and other equipment. Under the regulations, since January 1, 2015 owners and operators of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells (wells drilled principally for the production of natural gas) have been required to use so-called “green completion” technology to recover natural gas that formerly would have been flared or vented. Obtaining permits and complying with these new requirements has the potential to increase costs of production and delay the development of our properties.   8  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Compliance with the Clean Water Act may restrict the location of certain facilities, require the mitigation of impacted wetlands, increase the cost of capital expenditures, and may result in permitting delays. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), provided that diesel fuel is not used in the fracturing process. In prior Congressional Sessions, legislation has been introduced that would have repealed this exemption. If similar legislation were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In 2010, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives through an informal policy statement posted on the agency’s website. Industry groups filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA’s decision. In February 2012, the EPA and industry reached a settlement under which the EPA agreed to issue hydraulic fracturing permitting guidance through the notice and comment process. The EPA published a draft guidance document in May 2012, and accepted comments through August 2012. In February 2014, the EPA published final guidance that broadly defined diesel fuel and which requires the issuance of a Class II Underground Injection Control permit for hydraulic fracturing treatments using diesel fuel. These requirements may cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process using diesel fuel. The EPA has also asserted in certain cases involving alleged groundwater contamination that it has emergency authority under the SDWA to issue administrative compliance orders to require clean-up of groundwater. Although the United States Supreme Court has held that such orders are subject to pre-enforcement judicial review, the EPA maintains that it has the authority to continue to issue such orders. The EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) has conducted a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The ORD published draft results in 2015, concluding that hydraulic fracturing operations do impact drinking water resources but declining to reach conclusions about the frequency or severity of those impacts. In addition to the EPA study, there are other governmental reviews that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. In April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order establishing an interagency working group to coordinate Federal policies related to unconventional gas development. In addition, a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, in 2011 the U.S. Department of Energy conducted an investigation to identify best practices for hydraulic fracturing. These investigations, initiatives, and studies could result in additional efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing.  Beyond studying hydraulic fracturing, certain members of Congress have called upon the Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing. Any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing resulting from these efforts could result in delays, additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, and more stringent construction requirements, thereby significantly increasing operating, capital and compliance costs. Such cost increases could delay or restrict development by operators of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In response to a 2014 ballot initiative by the voters of the City of Denton, Texas banning hydraulic fracturing, the Texas legislature enacted a statute preempting local government regulation of oil and gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing. In other states, however, local governments may retain the ability to directly or indirectly regulate hydraulic fracturing. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties complying with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells.  9  The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress or executive orders or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation. Almost half of the states, however, have developed GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. These cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment by contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA required the agency to adopt regulations to restrict GHG emissions under the Federal Clean Air Act. In 2010, the EPA issued a final rule “tailoring” its New Source Review permitting and Federal Operating Permit programs to apply to facilities with certain thresholds of GHG emissions. This “Tailoring Rule” was challenged in court, and on June 23, 2014, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Tailoring Rule in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency. In its decision, the Court held that the EPA may not impose permitting requirements on facilities based solely on their emissions of GHGs. But, the Court also held that the EPA may regulate GHG emissions if a facility is otherwise subject to permitting based on the emissions of conventional, non-GHG pollutants. Thus, any new facilities or major modifications to existing facilities that exceed the federal New Source Review emission thresholds for conventional pollutants may be required to use “best available control technology” and energy efficiency measures to minimize GHG emissions. In December 2010, the EPA enacted final regulations on mandatory reporting of GHGs. Those regulations required owners or operators of facilities that contain petroleum and natural gas systems and emit 25,000 metric tons or more of GHGs per year (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2E) to annually report carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, beginning in September 2012. The EPA has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future GHG emission limits. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require the operating partnership and oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period.  10  Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our general partner, and their ability to remove our general partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our general partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our general partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our general partner on an annual or any other basis. Our general partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our general partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our general partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our general partner relating to their interests in our general partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our general partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our general partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of general partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our general partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our general partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our general partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 20% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established.  11  We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our general partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, Bradley J. Ehrman, its Chief Operating Officer and Leslie A. Moriyama, its Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain. Tax Risks The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should, therefore, consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and general partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 2013 we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI and the Maecenas NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As stated above, we have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the IRS as to our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to challenge our federal income tax status, such a challenge could result in an audit of our unitholders’ tax returns and adjustments to items on their tax returns that are unrelated to their ownership of our common units. In addition, our unitholders would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of their personal tax returns. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, our income, gains, losses and deductions would be reflected on our tax return rather than being passed through proportionately to our unitholders, and our net income would be taxed at corporate rates. In addition, some or all of the distributions made to our unitholders would be treated as dividend income without offset for depletion, and distributions would be reduced as a result of the federal, state and local taxes paid by us. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we may also be subject to additional state-level corporate income or franchise taxes. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if this method is determined to be an unreasonable method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction would be reallocated among our unitholders and our general partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.  12  Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Internal Revenue Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may have to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our general partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our general partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the operating partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the operating partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the operating partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if he qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, he generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion.  13  Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Internal Revenue Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest in the partnership must be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by United States Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our general partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors including: (i) the amount of taxable income recognized by us; (ii) the amount of any gain recognized by us that is attributable to specific asset sales that may be wholly or partially attributable to Built-in Gain and the resulting allocation of such gain to a unitholder, depending on the asset being sold; (iii) the amount of basis adjustment pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code available to a unitholder based on the purchase price for any common units and the amount by which such price was greater or less than a unitholder’s proportionate share of inside tax basis of our assets attributable to the common units when the common units were purchased; and (iv) the method of depletion available to a unitholder. Therefore, it is not possible for us to predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if he lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, he may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. If we are not notified (either directly or through a broker) of a sale or other transfer of common units, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to such units may not be provided to the purchaser or other transferee of the units and may instead continue to be provided to the original transferor. If our transfer agent or any other nominee holding common units on behalf of a partner is not timely notified of a sale or other transfer of common units, and a proper transfer of ownership is not recorded on the appropriate books and records, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to these common units may not be made or provided to the transferee of the units and may instead continue to be made or provided to the original transferor. Notwithstanding a transferee's failure to receive distributions and federal income tax information or reports from us with respect to these units, the IRS may contend that such transferee is a partner for federal income tax purposes and that some allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferee. Alternatively, the IRS may contend that the transferor continues to be a partner for federal income tax purposes and that allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferor. If the transferor is not treated as a partner for federal income tax purposes, any cash distributions received by such transferor with respect to the transferred units following the transfer would be fully taxable as ordinary income to the transferor.  14  A sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period could result in adverse tax consequences to a unitholder. We will terminate for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. A termination would result in the closing of our taxable year for a unitholder. As a result, if a unitholder has a different taxable year than we have, he may be required to include his allocable share of our income, gain, loss, deduction, credits and other items from both the taxable year ending prior to the year of our termination and the short taxable year ending at the time of our termination in the same taxable year. A termination also could result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination occurred. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where he resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. Both the Proposed Fiscal Year 2017 Federal Budget and proposed legislation in Congress would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration activities. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available to our unitholders and to oil and natural gas operators that we rely upon to develop our properties. Such legislation or changes could negatively impact both our unitholders and our Partnership financially. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We generally will have the ability to shift any such tax liability to our general partner and our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.

10,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2015-02-19,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:  ●the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;  ●the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;  ●political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;    ●the price and level of foreign imports;    ●the level of consumer demand;    ●the price and availability of alternative fuels;    ●the availability of pipeline capacity;    ●weather conditions;    ●domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and    ●the overall economic environment. Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders.  4   We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the operating partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The operating partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The operating partnership and the other current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. The operating partnership can sell any of the properties underlying the NPIs that it operates and relinquish the ability to control or influence operations. Any such sale or transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. The operating partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our general partner, through the operating partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The operating partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, some of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Some of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. Many of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. In addition, development possibilities by the operating partnership in the Hugoton field are limited by the developed nature of that field and by regulatory restrictions. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our general partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our general partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration.  5   Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The operating partnership may undertake drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our other properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: ●     pressure or irregularities in formations; ●     equipment failures or accidents; ●     unexpected drilling conditions; ●     shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment; ●     adverse weather conditions; and ●     disputes with drill-site owners. Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests. Because of the limitations on our use of cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions with our limited partnership interests. However, sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our general partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our general partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our general partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives.  6   A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are natural gas properties located in the Hugoton field in Oklahoma. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. The number of prospective natural gas purchasers and methods of delivery are considerably less than would otherwise exist from a more geographically diverse group of properties. As a result, natural gas sales after gathering and compression tend to be sold to one buyer in each state, thereby increasing credit risk. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the operating partnership. Damages associated with the production and gathering of our oil and natural gas properties could affect our cash flow. The operating partnership owns and operates gathering systems and compression facilities. Casualty losses or damages from these operations would be production costs under the terms of the NPIs and could adversely affect our cash flow. We may indirectly experience costs from repair or replacement of aging equipment. Some of the operating partnership's current working interest wells were drilled and have been producing since prior to 1954. The 132-mile Oklahoma gas pipeline gathering system was originally installed in or about 1948 and because of its age is in need of periodic repairs and upgrades. Should major components of this system require significant repairs or replacement, the operating partnership may incur substantial capital expenditures in the operation of the Oklahoma properties, which, as production costs, would reduce our cash flow from these properties. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the operating partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, Oklahoma, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future.  7  As another example, Oklahoma regulations currently require administrative hearings to change the concentration of the operating partnership’s gas production wells from one well for each 640 acres in the Guymon-Hugoton field. Previously, certain interested parties have sought regulatory changes in Oklahoma for ""infill,"" or increased density drilling similar to that which is available in Kansas, which allows one well for each 320 acres. Should Oklahoma change its existing regulations to readily permit infill drilling, it is possible that a number of producers will commence increased density drilling in areas adjacent to the properties in Oklahoma that are subject to the NPIs. If the operating partnership or other operators of our properties do not do the same, our production levels relating to these properties may decrease, or mineral owners may demand increased density drilling. Capital expenditures relating to increased density on the properties underlying the NPIs would be deducted from amounts payable to us under the NPIs. Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation could reduce the amount we would receive from our properties. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain hazardous substances are commonly used in connection with oil and gas operations. Responsible persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have been disposed. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority.  The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The EPA continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from oil and gas facilities. Specifically, on April 18, 2012, the EPA issued new final regulations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”). The new regulations are designed to reduce volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from hydraulically fractured wells and other equipment. Under the regulations, since January 1, 2015 owners and operators of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells (wells drilled principally for the production of natural gas) have been required to use so-called “green completion” technology to recover natural gas that formerly would have been flared or vented. Obtaining permits and complying with these new requirements has the potential to increase costs of production and delay the development of our properties.   8   The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Compliance with the Clean Water Act may restrict the location of certain facilities, require the mitigation of impacted wetlands, increase the cost of capital expenditures, and may result in permitting delays. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), provided that diesel fuel is not used in the fracturing process. In prior Congressional Sessions, legislation has been introduced that would have repealed this exemption. If similar legislation were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In 2010, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives through an informal policy statement posted on the agency’s website. Industry groups filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA’s decision. In February 2012, the EPA and industry reached a settlement under which the EPA agreed to issue hydraulic fracturing permitting guidance through the notice and comment process. The EPA published a draft guidance document in May 2012, and accepted comments through August 2012. The EPA’s final guidance, which has not yet been issued, may result in extensive requirements that could cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process using diesel fuel.  The EPA has also asserted in certain cases involving alleged groundwater contamination that it has emergency authority under the SDWA to issue administrative compliance orders to require clean up of groundwater. Although the United States Supreme Court has held that such orders are subject to pre-enforcement judicial review, the EPA maintains that it has the authority to continue to issue such orders. The EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) is conducting a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The ORD had expected to publish final results by 2014, but as of January 2015 final results had not been released. In addition to the EPA study, there are other governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. In April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order establishing an interagency working group to coordinate Federal policies related to unconventional gas development. In addition, a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, in 2011 the U.S. Department of Energy conducted an investigation to identify best practices for hydraulic fracturing. These investigations, initiatives, and studies could result in additional efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing. Beyond studying hydraulic fracturing, certain members of Congress have called upon the Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing. Any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing resulting from these efforts could result in delays, additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, and more stringent construction requirements, thereby significantly increasing operating, capital and compliance costs. Such cost increases could delay or restrict development by operators of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For instance, in November 2014 voters in the City of Denton, Texas voted to ban hydraulic fracturing. While that ordinance is the subject of ongoing litigation, other local governments may attempt to enact similar bans in the future. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties complying with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells.  9   The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress or executive orders or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation. Almost half of the states, however, have developed GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. These cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment by contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA required the agency to adopt regulations to restrict GHG emissions under the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA issued a final stationary source GHG rule in May 2010, which requires sources meeting certain thresholds to obtain a permit for GHG emissions. The EPA has also proposed GHG emissions standards for specific industries.  In December 2010, the EPA enacted final regulations on mandatory reporting of GHGs. Those regulation required owners or operators of facilities that contain petroleum and natural gas systems and emit 25,000 metric tons or more of GHGs per year (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2E) to annually report carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, beginning in September 2012. The EPA has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future greenhouse gas emission limits. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require the operating partnership and oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our general partner, and their ability to remove our general partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our general partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our general partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our general partner on an annual or any other basis.  10   Our general partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our general partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our general partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our general partner relating to their interests in our general partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our general partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our general partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of general partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our general partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our general partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our general partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 20% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established.  11   We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our general partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, James E. Raley, its Chief Operating Officer, H. C. Allen, Jr., its Chief Financial Officer, and Bradley J. Ehrman, its Vice President of Operations. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain.  Tax Risks The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should, therefore, consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and general partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 2013 we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI and the Maecenas NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As stated above, we have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the IRS as to our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to challenge our federal income tax status, such a challenge could result in an audit of our unitholders’ tax returns and adjustments to items on their tax returns that are unrelated to their ownership of our common units. In addition, our unitholders would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of their personal tax returns. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, our income, gains, losses and deductions would be reflected on our tax return rather than being passed through proportionately to our unitholders, and our net income would be taxed at corporate rates. In addition, some or all of the distributions made to our unitholders would be treated as dividend income without offset for depletion, and distributions would be reduced as a result of the federal, state and local taxes paid by us. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we may also be subject to additional state-level corporate income or franchise taxes. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if this method is determined to be an unreasonable method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction would be reallocated among our unitholders and our general partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.  12   Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Internal Revenue Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may have to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our general partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our general partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the operating partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the operating partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the operating partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if he qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, he generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion.   13   Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Internal Revenue Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest in the partnership must be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by United States Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our general partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors including: (i) the amount of taxable income recognized by us; (ii) the amount of any gain recognized by us that is attributable to specific asset sales that may be wholly or partially attributable to Built-in Gain and the resulting allocation of such gain to a unitholder, depending on the asset being sold; (iii) the amount of basis adjustment pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code available to a unitholder based on the purchase price for any common units and the amount by which such price was greater or less than a unitholder’s proportionate share of inside tax basis of our assets attributable to the common units when the common units were purchased; and (iv) the method of depletion available to a unitholder. Therefore, it is not possible for us to predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if he lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, he may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. If we are not notified (either directly or through a broker) of a sale or other transfer of common units, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to such units may not be provided to the purchaser or other transferee of the units and may instead continue to be provided to the original transferor. If our transfer agent or any other nominee holding common units on behalf of a partner is not timely notified of a sale or other transfer of common units, and a proper transfer of ownership is not recorded on the appropriate books and records, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to these common units may not be made or provided to the transferee of the units and may instead continue to be made or provided to the original transferor. Notwithstanding a transferee's failure to receive distributions and federal income tax information or reports from us with respect to these units, the IRS may contend that such transferee is a partner for federal income tax purposes and that some allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferee. Alternatively, the IRS may contend that the transferor continues to be a partner for federal income tax purposes and that allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferor. If the transferor is not treated as a partner for federal income tax purposes, any cash distributions received by such transferor with respect to the transferred units following the transfer would be fully taxable as ordinary income to the transferor.   14  A sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period could result in adverse tax consequences to a unitholder. We will terminate for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. A termination would result in the closing of our taxable year for a unitholder. As a result, if a unitholder has a different taxable year than we have, he may be required to include his allocable share of our income, gain, loss, deduction, credits and other items from both the taxable year ending prior to the year of our termination and the short taxable year ending at the time of our termination in the same taxable year. A termination also could result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination occurred. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where he resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. Both the Proposed Fiscal Year 2015 Federal Budget and recently proposed legislation in Congress would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration activities. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available to our unitholders and to oil and natural gas operators that we rely upon to develop our properties. Such legislation or changes could negatively impact both our unitholders and our Partnership financially. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.

8,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2014-02-20,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as: ●     the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;  ●the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;  ●political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;    ●the price and level of foreign imports;    ●the level of consumer demand;    ●the price and availability of alternative fuels;    ●the availability of pipeline capacity;    ●weather conditions;    ●domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and    ●the overall economic environment. 4  Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders. We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the operating partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The operating partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The operating partnership and the other current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. The operating partnership can sell any of the properties underlying the NPIs that it operates and relinquish the ability to control or influence operations. Any such sale or transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. The operating partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our general partner, through the operating partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The operating partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, some of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Some of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. Many of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. In addition, development possibilities by the operating partnership in the Hugoton field are limited by the developed nature of that field and by regulatory restrictions. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our general partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our general partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration.  5  Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The operating partnership may undertake drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our other properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: ●     pressure or irregularities in formations;●     equipment failures or accidents;●     unexpected drilling conditions;●     shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;●     adverse weather conditions; and●     disputes with drill-site owners. Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests. Because of the limitations on our use of cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions with our limited partnership interests. However, sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our general partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our general partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions and development of our undeveloped property. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions and investments, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our general partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives.  6  A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are natural gas properties located in the Hugoton field in Oklahoma and Kansas. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. The number of prospective natural gas purchasers and methods of delivery are considerably less than would otherwise exist from a more geographically diverse group of properties. As a result, natural gas sales after gathering and compression tend to be sold to one buyer in each state, thereby increasing credit risk. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the operating partnership. Damages associated with the production and gathering of our oil and natural gas properties could affect our cash flow. The operating partnership owns and operates gathering systems and compression facilities. Casualty losses or damages from these operations would be production costs under the terms of the NPIs and could adversely affect our cash flow. We may indirectly experience costs from repair or replacement of aging equipment. Some of the operating partnership's current working interest wells were drilled and have been producing since prior to 1954. The 132-mile Oklahoma gas pipeline gathering system was originally installed in or about 1948 and because of its age is in need of periodic repairs and upgrades. Should major components of this system require significant repairs or replacement, the operating partnership may incur substantial capital expenditures in the operation of the Oklahoma properties, which, as production costs, would reduce our cash flow from these properties. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the operating partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, both Oklahoma and Kansas, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future.  7  As another example, Oklahoma regulations currently require administrative hearings to change the concentration of the operating partnership’s gas production wells from one well for each 640 acres in the Guymon-Hugoton field. Previously, certain interested parties have sought regulatory changes in Oklahoma for ""infill,"" or increased density drilling similar to that which is available in Kansas, which allows one well for each 320 acres. Should Oklahoma change its existing regulations to readily permit infill drilling, it is possible that a number of producers will commence increased density drilling in areas adjacent to the properties in Oklahoma that are subject to the NPIs. If the operating partnership or other operators of our properties do not do the same, our production levels relating to these properties may decrease, or mineral owners may demand increased density drilling. Capital expenditures relating to increased density on the properties underlying the NPIs would be deducted from amounts payable to us under the NPIs. Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always have possible risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation could reduce the amount we would receive from our properties. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited. It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite this exclusion, certain hazardous substances are commonly used in connection with oil and gas operations. Responsible persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have been disposed. Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA. Many of our properties have produced oil and/or gas for many years. We have no knowledge of current and prior operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and gas wastes. Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators. Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority.  The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The EPA continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from oil and gas facilities. Specifically, on April 18, 2012, the EPA issued new final regulations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”). The new regulations are designed to reduce volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from hydraulically fractured wells and other equipment. The regulations established a phase-in period that extends until January 2015. During the phase-in period, owners and operators must either flare their emissions or use so-called “green completion” technology. After January 2015 all newly hydraulically fractured wells must use green completion technology. Obtaining permits and complying with these new requirements has the potential to increase costs of production and delay the development of our properties.   8  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Compliance with the Clean Water Act may restrict the location of certain facilities, require the mitigation of impacted wetlands, increase the cost of capital expenditures, and may result in permitting delays. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation or executive orders could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), provided that diesel fuel is not used in the fracturing process. In prior Congressional Sessions, legislation has been introduced that would have repealed this exemption. If similar legislation were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. Such federal legislation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In 2010, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives through an informal policy statement posted on the agency’s website. Industry groups filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA’s decision. In February 2012, the EPA and industry reached a settlement under which EPA agreed to issue hydraulic fracturing permitting guidance through the notice and comment process. The EPA published a draft guidance document in May 2012, and accepted comments through August 2012. The EPA’s final guidance, which has not yet been issued, may result in extensive requirements that could cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process using diesel fuel.  The EPA has also asserted in certain cases involving alleged groundwater contamination that it has emergency authority under the SDWA to issue administrative compliance orders to require clean up of groundwater. Although the United States Supreme Court has held that such orders are subject to pre-enforcement judicial review, the EPA maintains that it has the authority to continue to issue such orders. The EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) is conducting a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The ORD expects to publish final results by 2014. In addition to the EPA study, there are other governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. In April 2012, President Obama issued an executive order establishing an interagency working group to coordinate Federal policies related to unconventional gas development. In addition, a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, in 2011 the U.S. Department of Energy conducted an investigation to identify best practices for hydraulic fracturing. These investigations, initiatives, and studies could result in additional efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing. Beyond studying hydraulic fracturing, certain members of Congress have called upon the Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing. Any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing resulting from these efforts could result in delays, additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, and more stringent construction requirements, thereby significantly increasing operating, capital and compliance costs. Such cost increases could delay or restrict development by operators of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. State and local governments may also seek to regulate or recover costs of activities tangentially associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as increased truck traffic. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties complying with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells. The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress or executive orders or regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation. Almost half of the states, however, have developed GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. These cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.  9  In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment by contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA required the agency to adopt regulations to restrict GHG emissions under the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA issued a final stationary source GHG rule in May 2010, which requires sources meeting certain thresholds to obtain a permit for GHG emissions. The EPA has also proposed GHG emissions standards for specific industries.  In December 2010, the EPA enacted final regulations on mandatory reporting of GHGs. That rule required owners or operators of facilities that contain petroleum and natural gas systems and emit 25,000 metric tons or more of GHGs per year (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2E) to report carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, beginning on March 31, 2012. The reporting deadline was later extended by EPA to September 28, 2012, for emissions occurring in 2011. The EPA has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future greenhouse gas emission limits. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require the operating partnership and oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our general partner, and their ability to remove our general partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our general partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our general partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our general partner on an annual or any other basis. Our general partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our general partner by other unitholders difficult.  10  These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our general partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our general partner relating to their interests in our general partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our general partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our general partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of general partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our general partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our general partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our general partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 20% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our general partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, James E. Raley, its Chief Operating Officer, H. C. Allen, Jr., its Chief Financial Officer, and Bradley J. Ehrman, its Vice President of Operations. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel.  11  We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain. Tax Risks The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should, therefore, consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We generally do not obtain rulings or assurances from the IRS or state or local taxing authorities on matters affecting us. We generally have not requested, and do not intend to request, rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or state or local taxing authorities with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or other matters affecting us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and general partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 2013 we obtained a ruling from the IRS permitting us to aggregate the Minerals NPI and the Maecenas NPI for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As stated above, we have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the IRS as to our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to challenge our federal income tax status, such a challenge could result in an audit of our unitholders’ tax returns and adjustments to items on their tax returns that are unrelated to their ownership of our common units. In addition, our unitholders would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of their personal tax returns. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, our income, gains, losses and deductions would be reflected on our tax return rather than being passed through proportionately to our unitholders, and our net income would be taxed at corporate rates. In addition, some or all of the distributions made to our unitholders would be treated as dividend income without offset for depletion, and distributions would be reduced as a result of the federal, state and local taxes paid by us. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we may also be subject to additional state-level corporate income or franchise taxes. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, if this method is determined to be an unreasonable method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction would be reallocated among our unitholders and our general partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited.  12   Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Internal Revenue Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may have to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our general partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our general partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the operating partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the operating partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the operating partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if he qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, he generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Internal Revenue Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest in the partnership must be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by United States Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units.  13  Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our general partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors including: (i) the amount of taxable income recognized by us; (ii) the amount of any gain recognized by us that is attributable to specific asset sales that may be wholly or partially attributable to Built-in Gain and the resulting allocation of such gain to a unitholder, depending on the asset being sold; (iii) the amount of basis adjustment pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code available to a unitholder based on the purchase price for any common units and the amount by which such price was greater or less than a unitholder’s proportionate share of inside tax basis of our assets attributable to the common units when the common units were purchased; and (iv) the method of depletion available to a unitholder. Therefore, it is not possible for us to predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if he lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, he may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. If we are not notified (either directly or through a broker) of a sale or other transfer of common units, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to such units may not be provided to the purchaser or other transferee of the units and may instead continue to be provided to the original transferor. If our transfer agent or any other nominee holding common units on behalf of a partner is not timely notified of a sale or other transfer of common units, and a proper transfer of ownership is not recorded on the appropriate books and records, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to these common units may not be made or provided to the transferee of the units and may instead continue to be made or provided to the original transferor. Notwithstanding a transferee's failure to receive distributions and federal income tax information or reports from us with respect to these units, the IRS may contend that such transferee is a partner for federal income tax purposes and that some allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferee. Alternatively, the IRS may contend that the transferor continues to be a partner for federal income tax purposes and that allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferor. If the transferor is not treated as a partner for federal income tax purposes, any cash distributions received by such transferor with respect to the transferred units following the transfer would be fully taxable as ordinary income to the transferor. A sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period could result in adverse tax consequences to a unitholder. We will terminate for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. A termination would result in the closing of our taxable year for a unitholder. As a result, if a unitholder has a different taxable year than we have, he may be required to include his allocable share of our income, gain, loss, deduction, credits and other items from both the taxable year ending prior to the year of our termination and the short taxable year ending at the time of our termination in the same taxable year. A termination also could result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination occurred.   14  Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where he resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. Both the Proposed Fiscal Year 2014 Federal Budget and recently proposed legislation in Congress would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration activities. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available to our unitholders and to oil and natural gas operators that we rely upon to develop our properties. Such legislation or changes could negatively impact both our unitholders and our Partnership financially. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.

4,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2013-02-21,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:·      the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;   ·the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;   ·political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;   ·the price and level of foreign imports;   ·the level of consumer demand;   ·the price and availability of alternative fuels;  ·the availability of pipeline capacity;   ·weather conditions;   ·domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and   ·the overall economic environment. Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders.   4   We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the operating partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The operating partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The operating partnership and the other current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. The operating partnership can sell any of the properties underlying the NPIs that it operates and relinquish the ability to control or influence operations. Any such sale or transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. The operating partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our general partner, through the operating partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The operating partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, some of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Some of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. Many of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. In addition, development possibilities by the operating partnership in the Hugoton field are limited by the developed nature of that field and by regulatory restrictions. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our general partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our general partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration.   5   Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The operating partnership may undertake drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our other properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: ·       pressure or irregularities in formations;·       equipment failures or accidents;·       unexpected drilling conditions;·       shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;·       adverse weather conditions; and·       disputes with drill-site owners. Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests. Because of the limitations on our use of cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions with our limited partnership interests. However, sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our general partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our general partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our general partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives.   6   A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are natural gas properties located  in the Hugoton field in Oklahoma and Kansas. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. The number of prospective natural gas purchasers and methods of delivery are considerably less than would otherwise exist from a more geographically diverse group of properties. As a result, natural gas sales after gathering and compression tend to be sold to one buyer in each state, thereby increasing credit risk. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the operating partnership. Damages associated with the production and gathering of our oil and natural gas properties could affect our cash flow. The operating partnership owns and operates gathering systems and compression facilities. Casualty losses or damages from these operations would be production costs under the terms of the NPIs and could adversely affect our cash flow. We may indirectly experience costs from repair or replacement of aging equipment. Some of the operating partnership's current working interest wells were drilled and have been producing since prior to 1954. The 132-mile Oklahoma gas pipeline gathering system was originally installed in or about 1948 and because of its age is in need of periodic repairs and upgrades. Should major components of this system require significant repairs or replacement, the operating partnership may incur substantial capital expenditures in the operation of the Oklahoma properties, which, as production costs, would reduce our cash flow from these properties. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the operating partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, both Oklahoma and Kansas, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future.   7   As another example, Oklahoma regulations currently require administrative hearings to change the concentration of the operating partnership’s gas production wells from one well for each 640 acres in the Guymon-Hugoton field. Previously, certain interested parties have sought regulatory changes in Oklahoma for ""infill,"" or increased density drilling similar to that which is available in Kansas, which allows one well for each 320 acres. Should Oklahoma change its existing regulations to readily permit infill drilling, it is possible that a number of producers will commence increased density drilling in areas adjacent to the properties in Oklahoma that are subject to the NPIs. If the operating partnership or other operators of our properties do not do the same, our production levels relating to these properties may decrease, or mineral owners may demand increased density drilling. Capital expenditures relating to increased density on the properties underlying the NPIs would be deducted from amounts payable to us under the NPIs. Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always expect to have some risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation could reduce the amount we would receive from our properties. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow.  Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. Because we do not directly operate our properties, our direct liability under environmental laws is limited.  It is likely, however, that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow.The following is a summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to oil and gas operations, and that may indirectly affect our cash flow.The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”).  CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The term “hazardous substance” is specifically defined to exclude petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof, natural gas and natural gas liquids.  Despite this exclusion, certain hazardous substances are commonly used in connection with oil and gas operations.  Responsible persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liabilities for the costs of investigating releases of hazardous substances, cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The operators of our properties may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have been disposed.  Although we are not an operator, our ownership of royalty interests could cause us to be responsible for all or part of such costs to the extent that CERCLA imposes such responsibilities on such parties as “owners.” The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas are currently excluded from regulation under RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas exploration and production could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In addition, exploration and production wastes are regulated under state laws analogous to RCRA.  Our properties have produced oil/or gas for many years.  We have no knowledge of the property operators’ procedures with respect to the disposal of oil and gas wastes.  Hydrocarbons or other solid or hazardous wastes may have been released on or under our properties by the operators or prior operators.  Our properties and the materials disposed or released on, at, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, and removal or remediation of such materials could be required by a governmental authority. The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and other requirements. Existing laws and regulations and possible future laws and regulations may require our operators to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and may impose stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.  The EPA continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from oil and gas facilities.  Specifically, on April 18, 2012, the EPA issued new final regulations under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPs”).  The new regulations are designed to reduce volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from hydraulically fractured wells and other equipment.  The regulations established a phase-in period that extends until January 2015.  During the phase-in period, owners and operators must either flare their emissions or use so-called “green completion” technology.  After January 2015 all newly hydraulically fractured wells must use green completion technology.  Obtaining permits and complying with these new requirements has the potential to increase costs of production and delay the development of our properties.   8   The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into regulated waters, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, an analogous state agency, or, in the case of fill material, the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Compliance with the Clean Water Act may restrict the location of certain facilities, increase the cost of capital expenditures, and may result in permitting delays. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempts hydraulic fracturing from federal regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), provided that diesel fuel is not used in the fracturing process.  In prior Congressional Sessions, legislation has been introduced that would have repealed this exemption.  If similar legislation were enacted, it could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements.  Such federal legislation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. In 2010, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives through an informal policy statement posted on the agency’s website.  Industry groups filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA’s decision.  In February 2012, the EPA and industry reached a settlement under which EPA agreed to issue hydraulic fracturing permitting guidance through the notice and comment process.  The EPA’s final guidance, which has not yet been issued, may result in extensive requirements that could cause additional costs and delays in the hydraulic fracturing process using diesel fuel. The EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) is conducting a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The ORD expects to publish final results by 2014. In addition to the EPA study, there are other governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing.  The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing.  For example, in 2011 the U.S. Department of Energy conducted an investigation to identify best practices for hydraulic fracturing.  These investigations and studies could result in additional efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing. Beyond studying hydraulic fracturing, certain members of Congress have called upon the Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing.  Any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing resulting from these efforts could result in delays, additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction requirements, thereby significantly increase operating, capital and compliance costs.  Such cost increases could delay or restrict development by operators of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas enacted a rule in December 2011, requiring public disclosure of certain information regarding additives, chemical ingredients, concentrations and water volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.  In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties complying with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells. The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation.  Almost half of the states, however, have developed GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs.  These cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Many states also have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.  9   In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment by contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA required the agency to adopt regulations to restrict GHG emissions under the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA has a stationary source GHG rule in May 2010, which requires sources meeting certain thresholds to obtain a permit for GHG emissions.  The EPA has also proposed GHG emissions standards for specific industries. In December 2010, the EPA enacted final regulations on mandatory reporting of GHGs.  That rule required owners or operators of facilities that contain petroleum and natural gas systems and emit 25,000 metric tons or more of GHGs per year (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2E) to report carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, beginning on March 31, 2012. The reporting deadline was later extended by EPA to September 28, 2012, for emissions occurring in 2011. The EPA has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future greenhouse gas emission limits. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require the operating partnership and oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes. Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our general partner, and their ability to remove our general partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our general partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our general partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our general partner on an annual or any other basis. Our general partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our general partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our general partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.   10   The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our general partner relating to their interests in our general partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our general partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our general partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of general partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our general partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our general partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our general partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders. We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 20% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our general partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, James E. Raley, its Chief Operating Officer, H. C. Allen, Jr., its Chief Financial Officer, and Bradley J. Ehrman, its Vice President of Operations. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel.   11   We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain. Tax Risks The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should, therefore, consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We have not received a ruling or assurances from the IRS or any state or local taxing authority on any matters affecting us. We have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or any state or local taxing authority with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or any other matter. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and general partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority. We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As stated above, we have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the IRS as to our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to challenge our federal income tax status, such a challenge could result in an audit of our unitholders’ tax returns and adjustments to items on their tax returns that are unrelated to their ownership of our common units. In addition, our unitholders would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of their personal tax returns. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, our income, gains, losses and deductions would be reflected on our tax return rather than being passed through proportionately to our unitholders, and our net income would be taxed at corporate rates. In addition, some or all of the distributions made to our unitholders would be treated as dividend income without offset for depletion, and distributions would be reduced as a result of the federal, state and local taxes paid by us. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we may also be subject to additional state-level corporate income or franchise taxes. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferors and transferee unitholders.  Nonetheless, if this method is determined to be an unreasonable method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction would be reallocated among our unitholders and our general partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS.   12   Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Internal Revenue Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may have to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our general partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would constitute UBTI. In addition, our general partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the operating partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the operating partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the operating partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if he qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, he generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Internal Revenue Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest in the partnership must be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by United States Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units.   13   Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our general partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors including: (i) the amount of taxable income recognized by us; (ii) the amount of any gain recognized by us that is attributable to specific asset sales that may be wholly or partially attributable to Built-in Gain and the resulting allocation of such gain to a unitholder, depending on the asset being sold; (iii) the amount of basis adjustment pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code available to a unitholder based on the purchase price for any common units and the amount by which such price was greater or less than a unitholder’s proportionate share of inside tax basis of our assets attributable to the common units when the common units were purchased; and (iv) the method of depletion available to a unitholder. Therefore, it is not possible for us to predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder.  Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if he lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, he may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. If we are not notified (either directly or through a broker) of a sale or other transfer of common units, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to such units may not be provided to the purchaser or other transferee of the units and may instead continue to be provided to the original transferor. If our transfer agent or any other nominee holding common units on behalf of a partner is not timely notified of a sale or other transfer of common units, and a proper transfer of ownership is not recorded on the appropriate books and records, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to these common units may not be made or provided to the transferee of the units and may instead continue to be made or provided to the original transferor. Notwithstanding a transferee's failure to receive distributions and federal income tax information or reports from us with respect to these units, the IRS may contend that such transferee is a partner for federal income tax purposes and that some allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferee. Alternatively, the IRS may contend that the transferor continues to be a partner for federal income tax purposes and that allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferor. If the transferor is not treated as a partner for federal income tax purposes, any cash distributions received by such transferor with respect to the transferred units following the transfer would be fully taxable as ordinary income to the transferor. A sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period could result in adverse tax consequences to a unitholder. We will terminate for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. A termination would result in the closing of our taxable year for a unitholder. As a result, if a unitholder has a different taxable year than we have, he may be required to include his allocable share of our income, gain, loss, deduction, credits and other items from both the taxable year ending prior to the year of our termination and the short taxable year ending at the time of our termination in the same taxable year. A termination also could result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination occurred. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where he resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us.   14   Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. Both the Proposed Fiscal Year 2013 Federal Budget and recently proposed legislation in Congress would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration activities. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available to our unitholders and to oil and natural gas operators that we rely upon to develop our properties. Such legislation or changes could negatively impact both our unitholders and our Partnership financially. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.

11,DMLP,DORCHESTER MINERALS  -LP,2012-02-24,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Our cash distributions are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been very volatile. Our quarterly cash distributions depend significantly on the prices realized from the sale of oil and, in particular, natural gas. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Various factors that are beyond our control will affect prices of oil and natural gas, such as:   ●the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas;  ●the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil prices and production controls;  ●political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;  ●the price and level of foreign imports;  ●the level of consumer demand;  ●the price and availability of alternative fuels;  ●the availability of pipeline capacity;  ●weather conditions;  ●domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and  ●the overall economic environment. Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce and may reduce our revenues and operating income. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to unitholders.   6   We do not control operations and development of the Royalty Properties or the properties underlying the NPIs that the operating partnership does not operate, which could impact the amount of our cash distributions. As the owner of a fractional undivided mineral or royalty interest, we do not control the development of the Royalty or NPI properties or the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from them, and our ability to influence development of nonproducing properties is severely limited. Also, since one of our stated business objectives is to avoid the generation of unrelated business taxable income, we are prohibited from participation in the development of our properties as a working interest or other expense-bearing owner. The decision to explore or develop these properties, including infill drilling, exploration of horizons deeper or shallower than the currently producing intervals, and application of enhanced recovery techniques will be made by the operator and other working interest owners of each property (including our lessees) and may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. Our unitholders are not able to influence or control the operation or future development of the properties underlying the NPIs. The operating partnership is unable to influence significantly the operations or future development of properties that it does not operate. The operating partnership and the other current operators of the properties underlying the NPIs are under no obligation to continue operating the underlying properties. The operating partnership can sell any of the properties underlying the NPIs that it operates and relinquish the ability to control or influence operations. Any such sale or transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. Our unitholders do not have the right to replace an operator. Our lease bonus revenue depends in significant part on the actions of third parties, which are outside of our control. Significant portions of the Royalty Properties are unleased mineral interests. With limited exceptions, we have the right to grant leases of these interests to third parties. We anticipate receiving cash payments as bonus consideration for granting these leases in most instances. Our ability to influence third parties' decisions to become our lessees with respect to these nonproducing properties is severely limited, and those decisions may be influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to oil and natural gas prices, interest rates, budgetary considerations and general industry and economic conditions. The operating partnership may transfer or abandon properties that are subject to the NPIs. Our general partner, through the operating partnership, may at any time transfer all or part of the properties underlying the NPIs. Our unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer; however, any such transfer must also simultaneously include the NPIs at a corresponding price. The operating partnership or any transferee may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce in commercially economic quantities. This could result in termination of the NPIs relating to the abandoned well. Cash distributions are affected by production and other costs, some of which are outside of our control. The cash available for distribution that comes from our royalty and mineral interests, including the NPIs, is directly affected by increases in production costs and other costs. Some of these costs are outside of our control, including costs of regulatory compliance and severance and other similar taxes. Other expenditures are dictated by business necessity, such as drilling additional wells in response to the drilling activity of others. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the underlying properties are depleting assets, and there are limitations on our ability to replace them. Our revenues and distributions depend in large part on the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from properties in which we hold an interest. Over time, all of our producing oil and natural gas properties will experience declines in production due to depletion of their oil and natural gas reservoirs, with the rates of decline varying by property. Replacement of reserves to maintain production levels requires maintenance, development or exploration projects on existing properties, or the acquisition of additional properties. The timing and size of maintenance, development or exploration projects will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas and on other factors beyond our control. Many of the decisions regarding implementation of such projects, including drilling or exploration on any unleased and undeveloped acreage, will be made by third parties. In addition, development possibilities by the operating partnership in the Hugoton field are limited by the developed nature of that field and by regulatory restrictions. Our ability to increase reserves through future acquisitions is limited by restrictions on our use of cash and limited partnership interests for acquisitions and by our general partner's obligation to use all reasonable efforts such as NPIs to avoid unrelated business taxable income. In addition, the ability of affiliates of our general partner to pursue business opportunities for their own accounts without tendering them to us in certain circumstances may reduce the acquisitions presented to us for consideration.   7   Drilling activities on our properties may not be productive, which could have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. The operating partnership may undertake drilling activities in limited circumstances on the properties underlying the NPIs, and third parties may undertake drilling activities on our other properties. Any increases in our reserves will come from such drilling activities or from acquisitions. Drilling involves a wide variety of risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:   ●pressure or irregularities in formations;  ●equipment failures or accidents;  ●unexpected drilling conditions;  ●shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;  ●adverse weather conditions; and  ●disputes with drill-site owners. Future drilling activities on our properties may not be successful. If these activities are unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under the terms of the NPIs, the costs of unsuccessful future drilling on the working interest properties that are subject to the NPIs will reduce amounts payable to us under the NPIs by 96.97% of these costs. Our ability to identify and capitalize on acquisitions is limited by contractual provisions and substantial competition. Our partnership agreement limits our ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties in the future, especially for consideration other than our limited partnership interests. Because of the limitations on our use of cash for acquisitions and on our ability to accumulate cash for acquisition purposes, we may be required to attempt to effect acquisitions with our limited partnership interests. However, sellers of properties we would like to acquire may be unwilling to take our limited partnership interests in exchange for properties. Our partnership agreement obligates our general partner to use all reasonable efforts to avoid generating unrelated business taxable income. Accordingly, to acquire working interests we would have to arrange for them to be converted into overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, or another type of interest that does not generate unrelated business taxable income. Third parties may be less likely to deal with us than with a purchaser to which such a condition would not apply. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing or completing business opportunities that might benefit us and our unitholders, particularly unitholders who are not tax-exempt investors. The duty of affiliates of our general partner to present acquisition opportunities to our Partnership is limited, pursuant to the terms of the business opportunities agreement. Accordingly, business opportunities that could potentially be pursued by us might not necessarily come to our attention, which could limit our ability to pursue a business strategy of acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We compete with other companies and producers for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Any future acquisitions will involve risks that could adversely affect our business, which our unitholders generally will not have the opportunity to evaluate. Our current strategy contemplates that we may grow through acquisitions. We expect to participate in discussions relating to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate any additional acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in connection with the acquisition, unless the terms of the acquisition require approval of our unitholders. Additionally, our unitholders will bear 100% of the dilution from issuing new common units while receiving essentially 96% of the benefit as 4% of the benefit goes to our general partner. Acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks, including assimilation difficulties, unfamiliarity with new assets or new geographic areas and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. In addition, the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our review and analysis of properties prior to any acquisition will be subject to uncertainties and, consistent with industry practice, may be limited in scope. We may not be able to successfully integrate any oil and natural gas properties that we acquire into our operations, or we may not achieve desired profitability objectives.   8   A natural disaster or catastrophe could damage pipelines, gathering systems and other facilities that service our properties, which could substantially limit our operations and adversely affect our cash flow. If gathering systems, pipelines or other facilities that serve our properties are damaged by any natural disaster, accident, catastrophe or other event, our income could be significantly interrupted. Any event that interrupts the production, gathering or transportation of our oil and natural gas, or which causes us to share in significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely impact the market price of our limited partnership units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We do not carry business interruption insurance. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are geographically concentrated, which could cause net proceeds payable under the NPIs to be impacted by regional events. A significant portion of the properties subject to the NPIs are all natural gas properties that are located almost exclusively in the Hugoton field in Oklahoma and Kansas. Because of this geographic concentration, any regional events, including natural disasters that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production may impact the net proceeds payable under the NPIs more than if the properties were more geographically diversified. The number of prospective natural gas purchasers and methods of delivery are considerably less than would otherwise exist from a more geographically diverse group of properties. As a result, natural gas sales after gathering and compression tend to be sold to one buyer in each state, thereby increasing credit risk. Under the terms of the NPIs, much of the economic risk of the underlying properties is passed along to us. Under the terms of the NPIs, virtually all costs that may be incurred in connection with the properties, including overhead costs that are not subject to an annual reimbursement limit, are deducted as production costs or excess production costs in determining amounts payable to us. Therefore, to the extent of the revenues from the burdened properties, we bear 96.97% of the costs of the working interest properties. If costs exceed revenues, we do not receive any payments under the NPIs. However, except as described below, we are not required to pay any excess costs. The terms of the NPIs provide for excess costs that cannot be charged currently because they exceed current revenues to be accumulated and charged in future periods, which could result in us not receiving any payments under the NPIs until all prior uncharged costs have been recovered by the operating partnership. Damages associated with the production and gathering of our oil and natural gas properties could affect our cash flow. The operating partnership owns and operates gathering systems and compression facilities. Casualty losses or damages from these operations would be production costs under the terms of the NPIs and could adversely affect our cash flow. We may indirectly experience costs from repair or replacement of aging equipment. Some of the operating partnership's current working interest wells were drilled and have been producing since prior to 1954. The 132-mile Oklahoma gas pipeline gathering system was originally installed in or about 1948 and because of its age is in need of periodic repairs and upgrades. Should major components of this system require significant repairs or replacement, the operating partnership may incur substantial capital expenditures in the operation of the Oklahoma properties, which, as production costs, would reduce our cash flow from these properties. Our cash flow is subject to operating hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be fully insured. Neither we nor the operating partnership are fully insured against certain risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. Operations that affect the properties are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the oil and natural gas business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial decreases in the cash flow from our royalty interests and other interests due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Any uninsured costs relating to the properties underlying the NPIs will be deducted as a production cost in calculating the net proceeds payable to us. Governmental policies, laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and cash distributions. Our business and the properties in which we hold interests are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry as well as regulations relating to safety matters. These laws and regulations can have a significant impact on production and costs of production. For example, both Oklahoma and Kansas, where properties that are subject to the NPIs are located, have the ability, directly or indirectly, to limit production from those properties, and such limitations or changes in those limitations could negatively impact us in the future.   9   As another example, Oklahoma regulations currently require administrative hearings to change the concentration of the operating partnership’s gas production wells from one well for each 640 acres in the Guymon-Hugoton field. Previously, certain interested parties have sought regulatory changes in Oklahoma for ""infill,"" or increased density drilling similar to that which is available in Kansas, which allows one well for each 320 acres. Should Oklahoma change its existing regulations to readily permit infill drilling, it is possible that a number of producers will commence increased density drilling in areas adjacent to the properties in Oklahoma that are subject to the NPIs. If the operating partnership or other operators of our properties do not do the same, our production levels relating to these properties may decrease, or mineral owners may demand increased density drilling. Capital expenditures relating to increased density on the properties underlying the NPIs would be deducted from amounts payable to us under the NPIs. Environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could affect our cash flow. As with other companies engaged in the ownership and production of oil and natural gas, we always expect to have some risk of exposure to environmental costs and liabilities because the costs associated with environmental compliance or remediation could reduce the amount we would receive from our properties. The properties in which we hold interests are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs, health and safety and waste management. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits, which could increase production costs on our properties and affect their cash flow. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance. It is likely that expenditures in connection with environmental matters, individually or as part of normal capital expenditure programs, will affect the net cash flow from our properties. Future environmental law developments, such as stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies, could significantly increase the costs of production from our properties and reduce our cash flow. The potential adoption of federal and state hydraulic fracturing legislation could delay or restrict development of our oil and natural gas properties. During the last Congressional Session, several bills were proposed that would have subjected the process of hydraulic fracturing to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Similar legislation may be proposed by the current Congress.  In addition, the EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) is conducting a scientific study to investigate the possible relationships between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The ORD expects to have the initial study results available by late 2012 and final results by 2014.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate production. The use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas from many reservoirs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the ORD’s study and any resulting legislation, any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could significantly increase operating, capital and compliance costs. Such cost increases could delay or restrict development by operators of our oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, certain states in which our properties are located, including Texas and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.  For example, Texas adopted a law in June 2011 requiring disclosure to the Railroad Commission of Texas, or the RCT, and the public disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process.  In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.  In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our properties are located, the cost of the operators of our oil and natural gas properties complying with such requirements may be significant in nature, which may cause delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even preclude the operators from drilling wells. The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas production from our properties. To date, Congress has not passed a bill specifically addressing greenhouse gas (GHG) regulation.  However, the EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect January 1, 2010, and require reporting by regulated facilities by March 2011 and annually thereafter. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an “Endangerment Finding” under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The EPA has issued final regulations requiring petroleum and natural gas operators meeting a certain emission threshold to report their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA.  The EPA has indicated that it will use data collected through the reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future greenhouse gas emission limits. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs could require the operating partnership and oil and natural gas operators that develop our properties to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Our oil and natural gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain. Estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues are projections based on engineering data and reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers hired for that purpose. The process of estimating reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. Therefore, those estimates should not be construed as being accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, our business may be adversely affected by lower revenues. We are affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. Oil prices and natural gas prices may experience inverse price changes.   10   Risks Inherent In An Investment In Our Common Units Cost reimbursement due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available to distribute to our unitholders. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for reasonable costs and expenses of management. The reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Our general partner has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses, subject to the annual limit of 5% of an amount primarily based on our distributions to partners for that fiscal year. The annual limit includes carry-forward and carry-back features, which could allow costs in a year to exceed what would otherwise be the annual reimbursement limit. In addition, our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner. Our net income as reported for tax and financial statement purposes may differ significantly from our cash flow that is used to determine cash available for distributions. Net income as reported for financial statement purposes is presented on an accrual basis in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Unitholder K-1 tax statements are calculated based on applicable tax conventions, and taxable income as calculated for each year will be allocated among unitholders who hold units on the last day of each month. Distributions, however, are calculated on the basis of actual cash receipts, changes in cash reserves, and disbursements during the relevant reporting period. Consequently, due to timing differences between the receipt of proceeds of production and the point in time at which the production giving rise to those proceeds actually occurs, net income reported on our consolidated financial statements and on unitholder K-1's will not reflect actual cash distributions during that reporting period. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our general partner, and their ability to remove our general partner is limited. Our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. The general partner of our general partner manages our activities. Our unitholders only have the right to annually elect the managers comprising the Advisory Committee of the Board of Managers of the general partner of our general partner. Our unitholders do not have the right to elect the other managers of the general partner of our general partner on an annual or any other basis. Our general partner may not be removed as our general partner except upon approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units (including common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Our general partner and its affiliates do not own sufficient common units to be able to prevent its removal as general partner, but they do own sufficient common units to make the removal of our general partner by other unitholders difficult. These provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or acquire control of us without the consent of our general partner. As a result of these provisions, the price at which our common units trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. Our general partner may withdraw or transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Other than some transfer restrictions agreed to among the owners of our general partner relating to their interests in our general partner, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement or otherwise for the benefit of our limited partners on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interests to a third party. The new owner of the general partner would then be in a position to replace the management of our Partnership with its own choices. Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interests, which may permit our general partner and its affiliates to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders. We and our general partner and its affiliates share, and therefore compete for, the time and effort of general partner personnel who provide services to us. Officers of our general partner and its affiliates do not, and are not required to, spend any specified percentage or amount of time on our business. In fact, our general partner has a duty to manage our Partnership in the best interests of our unitholders, but it also has a duty to operate its business for the benefit of its partners. Some of our officers are also involved in management and ownership roles in other oil and natural gas enterprises and have similar duties to them and devote time to their businesses. Because these shared officers function as both our representatives and those of our general partner and its affiliates and of third parties, conflicts of interest could arise between our general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, or between us or our unitholders on the one hand and the third parties for which our officers also serve management functions. As a result of these conflicts, our general partner and its affiliates may favor their own interests over the interests of unitholders.   11   We may issue additional securities, diluting our unitholders' interests. We can and may issue additional common units and other capital securities representing limited partnership units, including options, warrants, rights, appreciation rights and securities with rights to distributions and allocations or in liquidation equal or superior to our common units; however, a majority of the unitholders must approve such issuance if (i) the partnership securities to be issued will have greater rights or powers than our common units or (ii) if after giving effect to such issuance, such newly issued partnership securities represent over 20% of the outstanding limited partnership interests. If we issue additional common units, it will reduce our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us. This could cause the market price of the common units to fall and reduce the per unit cash distributions paid to our unitholders. In addition, if we issued limited partnership units with voting rights superior to the common units, it could adversely affect our unitholders' voting power. Our unitholders may not have limited liability in the circumstances described below and may be liable for the return of certain distributions. Under Delaware law, our unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of unitholders to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business. Our general partner generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of our Partnership, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of our Partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. In addition, Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that, under certain circumstances, a unitholder may be liable for the amount of distribution for a period of three years from the date of distribution. Because we conduct our business in various states, the laws of those states may pose similar risks to our unitholders. To the extent to which we conduct business in any state, our unitholders might be held liable for our obligations as if they were general partners if a court or government agency determined that we had not complied with that state's partnership statute, or if rights of unitholders constituted participation in the ""control"" of our business under that state's partnership statute. In some of the states in which we conduct business, the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established. We are dependent upon key personnel, and the loss of services of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our continued success depends to a considerable extent upon the abilities and efforts of the senior management of our general partner, particularly William Casey McManemin, its Chief Executive Officer, James E. Raley, its Chief Operating Officer, and H. C. Allen, Jr., its Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have not obtained insurance or entered into employment agreements with any of these key personnel. We are dependent on service providers who assist us with providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders. There are a very limited number of service firms that currently perform the detailed computations needed to provide each unitholder with estimated depletion and other tax information to assist the unitholder in various United States income tax computations. There are also very few publicly traded limited partnerships that need these services. As a result, the future costs and timeliness of providing Schedule K-1 tax statements to our unitholders is uncertain. Tax Risks The tax consequences to a unitholder of the ownership and sale of common units will depend in part on the unitholder’s tax circumstances. Each unitholder should, therefore, consult such unitholder’s own tax advisor about the federal, state and local tax consequences of the ownership of common units. We have not received a ruling or assurances from the IRS or any state or local taxing authority on any matters affecting us. We have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or any state or local taxing authority with respect to owning and disposing of our common units or any other matter. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of those conclusions or positions taken or expressed by us, and some or all of those conclusions or positions ultimately may not be sustained. Our unitholders and general partner will bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of any contest with the IRS or other taxing authority.  12   We will be subject to federal income tax and possibly certain state corporate income or franchise taxes if we are classified as a corporation and not as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As stated above, we have not requested, and will not request, any ruling from the IRS as to our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to challenge our federal income tax status, such a challenge could result in an audit of our unitholders’ tax returns and adjustments to items on their tax returns that are unrelated to their ownership of our common units. In addition, our unitholders would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of their personal tax returns. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, our income, gains, losses and deductions would be reflected on our tax return rather than being passed through proportionately to our unitholders, and our net income would be taxed at corporate rates. In addition, some or all of the distributions made to our unitholders would be treated as dividend income without offset for depletion, and distributions would be reduced as a result of the federal, state and local taxes paid by us. If we were taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we may also be subject to additional state-level corporate income or franchise taxes. The IRS could reallocate items of income, gain, deduction and loss between transferors and transferees of common units if the IRS does not accept our monthly convention for allocating such items. In general, each of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will, for federal income tax purposes, be determined annually, and one twelfth of each annual amount will be allocated to those unitholders who hold common units on the last business day of each month in that year. In certain circumstances we may make these allocations in connection with extraordinary or nonrecurring events on a more frequent basis. As a result, transferees of our common units may be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of their acquisition of our common units. There is no specific authority addressing the utilization of this method of allocating items of income, gain, loss and deduction by a publicly traded partnership such as us between transferors and transferees of its common units. If this method is determined to be an unreasonable method of allocation, our income, gain, loss and deduction would be reallocated among our unitholders and our general partner, and our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss. Our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees, as well as among our other unitholders whose common units otherwise vary during a taxable period, to conform to a method permitted or required by the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder. Our unitholders may not be able to deduct losses attributable to their common units. Any losses relating to our unitholders’ common units will be losses related to portfolio income and their ability to use such losses may be limited. Our unitholders’ partnership tax information may be audited. We will furnish our unitholders with a Schedule K-1 tax statement that sets forth their allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing this schedule, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and various depreciation and amortization methods we have adopted. This schedule may not yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, and any such audit could result in an audit of our unitholders’ individual income tax returns as well as increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. An audit of our unitholders’ returns also could be triggered if the tax information relating to their common units is not consistent with the Schedule K-1 that we are required to provide to the IRS. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to their common units if the IRS does not respect our method for determining the adjusted tax basis of their common units. We have adopted a reporting convention that will enable our unitholders to track the basis of their individual common units or unit groups and use this basis in calculating their basis adjustments under Section 743 of the Internal Revenue Code and gain or loss on the sale of common units. This method does not comply with an IRS ruling that requires a portion of the combined tax basis of all common units to be allocated to each of the common units owned by a unitholder upon a sale or disposition of less than all of the common units and may be challenged by the IRS. If such a challenge is successful, our unitholders may have to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss with respect to common units disposed of and common units they continue to hold. Tax-exempt investors may recognize unrelated business taxable income. Generally, unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, can arise from a trade or business unrelated to the exempt purposes of the tax-exempt entity that is regularly carried on by either the tax-exempt entity or a partnership in which the tax-exempt entity is a partner. However, UBTI does not apply to interest income, royalties (including overriding royalties) or net profits interests, whether the royalties or net profits are measured by production or by gross or taxable income from the property. Pursuant to the provisions of our partnership agreement, our general partner shall use all reasonable efforts to prevent us from realizing income that would   13   constitute UBTI. In addition, our general partner is prohibited from incurring certain types and amounts of indebtedness and from directly owning working interests or cost bearing interests and, in the event that any of our assets become working interests or cost bearing interests, is required to assign such interests to the operating partnership subject to the reservation of a net profits overriding royalty interest. However, it is possible that we may realize income that would constitute UBTI in an effort to maximize unitholder value. Tax consequences of certain NPIs are uncertain. We are prohibited from owning working interests or cost-bearing interests. At the time of the creation of the Minerals NPI, we assigned to the operating partnership all rights in any such working interests or cost-bearing interests that might subsequently be created from the mineral properties that were and are subject of the Minerals NPI. As additional working interests and other cost-bearing interests are created out of such mineral properties, they are owned by the operating partnership pursuant to such original assignment, and we have executed various documents since the creation of the Minerals NPI to confirm such treatment under the original assignment. This treatment could be characterized differently by the IRS, and in such a case we are unable to predict, with certainty, all of the income tax consequences relating to the Minerals NPI as it relates to such working interests and other cost-bearing interests. Our unitholders may not be entitled to deductions for percentage depletion with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Our unitholders will be entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise allowable) percentage depletion with respect to the oil and natural gas interests owned by us. However, percentage depletion is generally available to a unitholder only if he qualifies under the independent producer exemption contained in the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, an independent producer is a person not directly or indirectly involved in the retail sale of oil, natural gas, or derivative products or the operation of a major refinery. If a unitholder does not qualify under the independent producer exemption, he generally will be restricted to deductions based on cost depletion. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of allocating depletion deductions. The Internal Revenue Code requires that income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest in the partnership must be allocated so that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as “Built-in Gain” and “Built-in Loss,” respectively, associated with the property at the time of its contribution to the partnership. Our partnership agreement provides that the adjusted tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties contributed to us is allocated to the contributing partners for the purpose of separately determining depletion deductions. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of property contributed to us will be allocated to the partners that contributed the property, in proportion to their percentage interest in the contributed property, to take into account any Built-in Gain or Built-in Loss. This method of allocating Built-in Gain and Built-in Loss is not specifically permitted by United States Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. Our unitholders may have more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis if the IRS does not accept our method of determining a unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property. Our general partner utilizes a method of calculating each unitholder's share of the basis of partnership property that results in an aggregate basis for depletion purposes that reflects the purchase price of common units as paid by the unitholder. This method is not specifically authorized under applicable Treasury regulations, and the IRS may challenge this method. Such a challenge, if successful, could cause our unitholders to recognize more taxable income or less taxable loss on an ongoing basis in respect of their common units. The ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder is uncertain, and cash distributed to a unitholder may not be sufficient to pay tax on the income we allocate to a unitholder. The amount of taxable income realized by a unitholder will be dependent upon a number of factors including: (i) the amount of taxable income recognized by us; (ii) the amount of any gain recognized by us that is attributable to specific asset sales that may be wholly or partially attributable to Built-in Gain and the resulting allocation of such gain to a unitholder, depending on the asset being sold; (iii) the amount of basis adjustment pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code available to a unitholder based on the purchase price for any common units and the amount by which such price was greater or less than a unitholder’s proportionate share of inside tax basis of our assets attributable to the common units when the common units were purchased; and (iv) the method of depletion available to a unitholder. Therefore, it is not possible for us to predict the ratio of the amount of taxable income that will be allocated to a unitholder to the amount of cash that will be distributed to a unitholder.   14   A unitholder may lose his status as a partner of our Partnership for federal income tax purposes if he lends our common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of such common units. If a unitholder loans his common units to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units, he may be considered as having disposed of his ownership of those common units for federal income tax purposes. If so, the unitholder would no longer be a partner of our Partnership for tax purposes with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units would not be reportable, and any cash distributions received for those common units would be fully taxable and may be treated as ordinary income. If we are not notified (either directly or through a broker) of a sale or other transfer of common units, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to such units may not be provided to the purchaser or other transferee of the units and may instead continue to be provided to the original transferor. If our transfer agent or any other nominee holding common units on behalf of a partner is not timely notified of a sale or other transfer of common units, and a proper transfer of ownership is not recorded on the appropriate books and records, some distributions and federal income tax information or reports with respect to these common units may not be made or provided to the transferee of the units and may instead continue to be made or provided to the original transferor. Notwithstanding a transferee's failure to receive distributions and federal income tax information or reports from us with respect to these units, the IRS may contend that such transferee is a partner for federal income tax purposes and that some allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferee. Alternatively, the IRS may contend that the transferor continues to be a partner for federal income tax purposes and that allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction by us should have been reported by such transferor. If the transferor is not treated as a partner for federal income tax purposes, any cash distributions received by such transferor with respect to the transferred units following the transfer would be fully taxable as ordinary income to the transferor. A sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period could result in adverse tax consequences to a unitholder. We will terminate for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. A termination would result in the closing of our taxable year for a unitholder. As a result, if a unitholder has a different taxable year than we have, he may be required to include his allocable share of our income, gain, loss, deduction, credits and other items from both the taxable year ending prior to the year of our termination and the short taxable year ending at the time of our termination in the same taxable year. A termination also could result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination occurred. Foreign, state and local taxes could be withheld on amounts otherwise distributable to a unitholder. A unitholder may be required to file tax returns and be subject to tax liability in the foreign, state or local jurisdictions where he resides and in each state or local jurisdiction in which we have assets or otherwise do business. We also may be required to withhold state income tax from distributions otherwise payable to a unitholder, and state income tax may be withheld by others on royalty payments to us. Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. Both the Proposed Fiscal Year 2012 Federal Budget and the proposed American Jobs Act of 2011 include potential legislation that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration activities. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available to our unitholders and to oil and natural gas operators that we rely upon to develop our properties. Such legislation or changes could negatively impact both our unitholders and our Partnership financially. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), are forward-looking statements.
