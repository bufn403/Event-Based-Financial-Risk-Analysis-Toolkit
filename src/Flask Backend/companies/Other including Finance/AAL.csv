10,AAL,AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC,2010-02-17,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSOur ability to become profitable and our ability to continue to fund our obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond our control.  Some of the factors that may have a negative impact on us are described below:As a result of significant losses in recent years, our financial condition has been materially weakened. We incurred significant losses in recent years, which has materially weakened our financial condition. We lost $893 million in 2005, $781 million in 2004, $1.2 billion in 2003, $3.5 billion in 2002 and $1.8 billion in 2001. Although we earned a profit of $456 million in 2007 and $189 million in 2006, welost $2.1 billion in 2008 (which included a $1.2 billion impairment charge), and, primarily as a result of very weak demand for air travel driven by the severe downturn in the global economy, we lost $1.5 billion in 2009.  Because of our weakened financial condition, we are vulnerable both to the impact of unexpected events (such as terrorist attacks) and to deterioration of the operating environment (such as a deepening of the current global recession, a significant increase in jet fuelprices or significant increased competition). The severe global economic downturn has resulted in very weak demand for air travel and lower investment asset returns, which has had and could continue to have a significant negative impact on us. We are experiencing very weak demand for air travel driven by the severe downturn in the global economy. Many of the countries we serve are experiencing economic slowdowns or recessions. We began to experience weakening demand late in 2008, and this weakness has continued into 2010. We reduced capacity in 2008, and in the first half of2009 we announced additional reductions to our capacity plan. In connection with these capacity reductions, the Company incurred special charges related to aircraft, employee reductions and certain other charges.  If the global economic downturn persists or worsens, demand for air travel may continue to weaken. No assurance can be given that capacity reductions or other steps we may take will be adequate to offset the effects of reduced demand.  Such capacity reductions or other steps mightresult in additional special charges in the future.  Further, other carriers may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity, which may reduce the expected benefits of our capacity reductions. The economic downturn has resulted in broadly lower investment asset returns and values.  Our pension assets suffered a material decrease in value in 2008 related to broader stock market declines, which resulted in higher pension expense in 2009 and will result in higher pension expense and higher required contributions in futureyears. In addition, under these unfavorable economic conditions, we may be required to maintain cash reserves under our credit card processing agreements and the potential obligation to post cash collateral on fuel hedging contracts. These issues individually or collectively may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. Also, disruptions in the capital markets and other sources of funding may make it impossible for us to obtain necessary additional funding or make the cost of that funding prohibitive. We face numerous challenges as we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity, and we will need to raise substantial additional funds. We may not be able to raise those funds, or to do so on acceptable terms. We have significant debt, lease and other obligations in the next several years, including significant pension funding obligations. In 2010, we will be required to make approximately $1.0 billion of principal payments on long-term debt and approximately $90 million in principal payments on capital leases, and we expect to spend approximately$2.1 billion on capital expenditures, including aircraft commitments.  In addition, in 2010, we are required to contribute approximately $525 million to our defined benefit pension plans. Moreover, the global economic downturn, rising fuel prices, the potential obligation to post reserves under credit card processing agreements and the potential obligation to post cash collateral on fuel hedging contracts, among other things, have negatively impacted, and may in the future negatively impact, our liquidity.To meet our commitments and to maintain sufficient liquidity as we continue to implement our revenue enhancement and cost reduction initiatives, we will need continued access to substantial additional funding. Moreover, while we have arranged financings that, subject to certain terms and conditions (including, in the case of financing arrangements covering a significant number of aircraft, a condition that, at the time of borrowing, we have a certain amount of unrestricted cash and short term investments), coverall of our aircraft delivery commitments through 2011, we will continue to need to raise substantial additional funds to meet our commitments.  Our ability to obtain future financing is limited by the value of our unencumbered assets. Almost all of our aircraft assets (including aircraft eligible for the benefits of Section 1110) are encumbered as a result of financing activity in recent years. This financing activity has significantly reduced the quantity of our assetswhich could be used as collateral in future financing.   Also, the market value of our aircraft assets has declined in recent years, and may continue to decline.  In addition, many of the other financing sources traditionally available to us may be difficult to access, and no assurance can be given as to the amount of financing available to us. Since the Terrorist Attacks, our credit ratings have been lowered to significantly below investment grade. These reductions have increased our borrowing costs and otherwise adversely affected borrowing terms, and limited borrowing options. Additional reductions in our credit ratings might have other effects on us, such as further increasingborrowing or other costs or further restricting our ability to raise funds. A number of other factors, including our financial results in recent years, our substantial indebtedness, the difficult revenue environment we face, our reduced credit ratings, recent historically high fuel prices, and the financial difficulties experienced in the airline industry, adversely affect the availability and terms of fundingfor us. In addition, the global economic downturn and recent severe disruptions in the capital markets and other sources of funding have resulted in greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads, and substantially more limited availability of funding.  As a result of these and other factors, although we believe we have or can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obligations, there can be no assurances to that effect. An inability to obtain necessary additional fundingon acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain our operations. We could be required to maintain reserves under our credit card processing agreements, which could materially adversely impact our liquidity. American has agreements with a number of credit card companies and processors to accept credit cards for the sale of air travel and other services. Under certain of these agreements, the related credit card processor may hold back a reserve from American’s credit card receivables following the occurrence of certain events, includingthe failure of American to maintain certain levels of liquidity (as specified in each agreement). Under such agreements, the amount of the reserve that may be required generally is based on the credit card processor’s exposure to the Company under the applicable agreement and, in the case of a reserve required because of American’s failure to maintain a certain level of liquidity, the amount of such liquidity.  Asof December 31, 2009, the Company was not required to maintain any reserve under such agreements.  If circumstances were to occur that would allow the credit card processor to require the Company to maintain a reserve, the Company’s liquidity would be negatively impacted. Our initiatives to generate additional revenues and to reduce our costs may not be adequate or successful. As we seek to improve our financial condition, we must continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and to reduce our costs. Although we have a number of initiatives underway to address our cost and revenue challenges, some of these initiatives involve changes to our business which we may be unable to implement. In addition, ithas become increasingly difficult to identify and implement significant revenue enhancement and cost savings initiatives. The adequacy and ultimate success of our initiatives to generate additional revenues and reduce our costs cannot be assured. Moreover, whether our initiatives will be adequate or successful depends in large measure on factors beyond our control, notably the overall industry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry capacity growth, and fuel prices. It will be very difficultfor us to continue to fund our obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to profitability, if the overall industry revenue environment does not improve substantially or if fuel prices were to increase and persist for an extended period at high levels.   We may be adversely affected by increases in fuel prices, and we would be adversely affected by disruptions in the supply of fuel. Our results are very significantly affected by the cost, volatile price and the availability of jet fuel, which are in turn affected by a number of factors beyond our control.  Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, we may not be able to pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares. Although wehad some success in raising fares and imposing fuel surcharges in reaction to high fuel prices, these fare increases and surcharges did not keep pace with the extraordinary increases in the price of fuel that occurred in 2007 and 2008. Although fuel prices have abated considerably from the record high prices recorded in July 2008, they have steadily increased since the first quarter of 2009 and remain high and extremely volatile by historical standards. Furthermore, reduced demand or increased fare competition,or both, and resulting lower revenues may offset any potential benefit of any reductions in fuel prices.While we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability, dependence on foreign imports of crude oil, limited refining capacity and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel. If there areadditional outbreaks of hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere, or a reduction in refining capacity (due to weather events, for example), or governmental limits on the production or sale of jet fuel (including as a consequence of increased environmental regulation), there could be a reduction in the supply of jet fuel and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel. Major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases in its cost would have a material adverseimpact on us. We have a large number of older aircraft in our fleet, and these aircraft are not as fuel efficient as more recent models of aircraft. We believe it is imperative that we continue to execute our fleet renewal plans. However, there will be significant delays in the deliveries of the Boeing 787-9 aircraft we currently have on order. While we seek to manage the risk of fuel price increases by using derivative contracts, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particular level of protection against increased fuel costs. In addition, a deterioration of our financial position could negatively affect our abilityto enter into derivative contracts in the future. Moreover, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in derivative contracts may require us to post cash collateral to secure the loss positions on such contracts, and if such contracts close when fuel prices are below the applicable levels, we would be required to make payments to close such contracts; these payments would be treated as additional fuel expense. Our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could adversely affect our business and liquidity. We have and will continue to have significant amounts of indebtedness, obligations to make future payments on aircraft equipment and property leases, and obligations under aircraft purchase agreements, as well as a high proportion of debt to equity capital. As of December 31, 2009, we were contractually committed to make approximately $1.1 billionof principal payments on long-term debt and payments on capital leases during 2010. We expect to incur substantial additional debt (including secured debt) and lease obligations in the future. We also have substantial pension funding obligations, and we are required to contribute approximately $525 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2010. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations have important consequences. For example, they:  • limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;        • require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;        • make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and catastrophic external events; and        • limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.  Our business is affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, and our results of operations tend to be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. Our business and our results of operations are affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:  • actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks or political instability;        • changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic trends;        • changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations and other factors;        • actual or potential disruptions to the air traffic control systems;        • increases in costs of safety, security and environmental measures;        • outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and        • weather and natural disasters.As a result, our results of operations tend to be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally greater demand for air travel during the summer, our revenues in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. The airline industry is fiercely competitive and may undergo further consolidation or changes in industry alliances, and we are subject to increasing competition. Service over almost all of our routes is highly competitive and fares remain at low levels by historical standards. We face vigorous, and, in some cases, increasing, competition from major domestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign air carriers, low-cost carriers and, particularly on shorter segments,ground and rail transportation. We also face increasing and significant competition from marketing/operational alliances formed by our competitors. The percentage of routes on which we compete with carriers having substantially lower operating costs than ours has grown significantly over the past decade, and we now compete with low-cost carriers on a large majority of our domestic non-stop mainline network routes.  Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitivecost structure.  If we cannot do so, then our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. Certain airline alliances have been granted immunity from antitrust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to effectively compete may be hindered. Pricing decisions are significantly affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discounting by competitors historically has had a negative effect on our financial results because we must generally match competitors’ fares, since failing to match would result in even less revenue. We have faced increased competition from carrierswith simplified fare structures, which are generally preferred by travelers. Any fare reduction or fare simplification initiative may not be offset by increases in passenger traffic, reduction in cost or changes in the mix of traffic that would improve yields. Moreover, decisions by our competitors that increase or reduce overall industry capacity, or capacity dedicated to a particular domestic or foreign region, market or route, can have a material impact on related fare levels. There have been numerous mergers and acquisitions within the airline industry and numerous changes in industry alliances. Recently, two of our largest competitors, Delta Air Lines, Inc. and Northwest Airlines Corporation, merged, and the combined entity became the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world in terms of available seatmiles and revenue passenger miles. In addition, another two of our largest competitors, United Air Lines, Inc. and Continental Airlines, Inc., announced in 2008 that they had entered into a framework agreement to cooperate extensively and in 2009, Continental joined the global alliance of which United, Lufthansa and certain other airlines are members.   In the future, there may be additional mergers and acquisitions, and changes in airline alliances, including those that may be undertaken in response to the merger of Delta and Northwest or other developments in the airline industry. Any airline industry consolidation or changes in airline alliances, including oneworld, could substantially alter the competitive landscape andresult in changes in our corporate or business strategy. We regularly assess and explore the potential for consolidation in our industry and changes in airline alliances, our strategic position and ways to enhance our competitiveness, including the possibilities for our participation in merger activity. Consolidation involving other participants in our industry could result in the formation of one or more airlines with greater financial resources, more extensive networks, and/or lower cost structures than existcurrently, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations. For similar reasons, changes in airline alliances could have a similar impact on us.In 2008, we entered into a joint business agreement and related marketing arrangements with British Airways and Iberia, providing for commercial cooperation on flights between North America and most countries in Europe, pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, expanded codesharing, enhanced frequent flyer program reciprocity,and cooperation in other areas. Along with these carriers, Finnair and Royal Jordanian, we have applied to DOT for ATI for this planned cooperation and in February 2010, we received tentative approval of that application from DOT.  Final approval from DOT is subject to certain conditions, including a requirement that American and British Airways lease a total of four takeoff and landing slots at London Heathrow (two slot pairs) to other carriers. The carriers are also seeking to address issuesraised by a Statement of Objection issued by the EU which asserts that certain aspects of the joint business agreement would infringe EU competition law.  In February 2010, American and JAL announced the decision to strengthen their relationship.  The carriers, both members of the oneworld alliance, jointly applied to DOT for ATI on certain routes, and jointly notified the MLIT in Tokyo of the proposed cooperation. The Company believesthis application will meet DOT’s pro-consumer and pro-competition criteria for granting ATI.  As a part of the application, American and JAL entered into a joint business agreement which will enhance their scope of cooperation on routes between North America and Asia, through adjustments to their respective networks, flight schedules, and other business activities. This, in turn, will allow both carriers to better complement each other’s operations and to develop and offer competitive productsand quality service to their customers. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information on the JAL joint business application.Any plans to enter into or expand ATI joint business agreements or similar arrangements, including implementation of the joint business agreements referred to above, are subject to various conditions, including various U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals, successful negotiation of certain detailed financial and commercial arrangements,and other approvals. Governmental entities from which such approvals must be obtained, including DOT and foreign governmental authorities or entities such as the EU, have imposed or may impose requirements or limitations as a condition of granting any such approvals, such as requiring divestiture of routes, gates, slots or other assets. No assurances can be given as to any arrangements that may ultimately be implemented or any benefits we may derive from such arrangements.We compete with reorganized carriers, which results in competitive disadvantages for us. We must compete with air carriers that have reorganized under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in recent years, including United, Delta and U.S. Airways. It is possible that other significant competitors may seek to reorganize in or out of Chapter 11. Successful reorganizations by other carriers present us with competitors with significantly lower operating costs and stronger financial positions derived from renegotiated labor, supply, and financing contracts. These competitive pressures may limit our ability to adequately price our services, may require us to further reduce our operatingcosts, and could have a material adverse impact on us. Fares are at low levels and our reduced pricing power adversely affects our ability to achieve adequate pricing, especially with respect to business travel. Our passenger yield remains very low by historical standards. We believe that this is due in large part to a corresponding decline in our pricing power. Our reduced pricing power is the product of several factors including: greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers (particularly business travelers); pricing transparency resultingfrom the use of the internet; greater competition from low-cost carriers and from carriers that have reorganized in recent years under the protection of Chapter 11; other carriers being well hedged against rising fuel costs and able to better absorb high jet fuel prices; fare simplification efforts by certain carriers; and the economy. We believe that our reduced pricing power could persist indefinitely.  Our corporate or business strategy may change. In light of the rapid changes in the airline industry, we evaluate our assets on an ongoing basis with a view to maximizing their value to us and determining which are core to our operations. We also regularly evaluate our corporate and business strategies, and they are influenced by factors beyond our control, including changes in thecompetitive landscape we face. Our corporate and business strategies are, therefore, subject to change. In the future, AMR may consider and engage in discussions with third parties regarding the divestiture of AMR Eagle and other separation transactions, and may decide to proceed with one or more such transactions. There can be no assurance that AMR will complete any separation transactions or that any announced plans or transactions willbe consummated, and no prediction can be made as to the impact of any such transactions on stockholder value or on us.Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which can result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.  In particular, recently enacted and possible future environmentalregulations may adversely affect our business and financial results. Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Many of these requirements result in significant costs. For example, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft. Compliance with those requirements drives significant expendituresand has in the past, and may in the future, cause disruptions to our operations. In addition, the ability of U.S. carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the U.S. and foreign governments may be amended from time to time (such as through the adoption of an open skies policy), or because appropriate slots or facilities are not made available. Anysuch change could adversely impact the value of our international route authorities and related assets. Moreover, additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been enacted from time to time that have significantly increased the costs of airline operations, reduced the demand for air travel or restricted the way we can conduct our business. For example, the ATSA, which became law in 2001, mandated the federalizationof certain airport security procedures and resulted in the imposition of additional security requirements on airlines.The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct our business each may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including:   • changes in law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports;        • the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including foreign government approvals) needed for codesharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines;        • restrictions on competitive practices (for example court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an airline’s ability to respond to a competitor);        • the adoption of regulations that impact customer service standards (for example new passenger security standards, passenger bill of rights);        • restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of takeoff and landing slots at airports or the auction of slot rights currently or previously held by us; or        • the adoption of more restrictive locally imposed noise restrictions. In addition, the U.S. air traffic control (ATC) system, which is operated by the FAA, is not successfully managing the growing demand for U.S. air travel. U.S. airlines carry about 750 million passengers a year and are forecast to accommodate a billion passengers annually by 2021. Air traffic controllers rely on outdatedtechnologies that routinely overwhelm the system and compel airlines to fly inefficient, indirect routes. We support a common sense approach to ATC modernization that would allocate costs to all ATC system users in proportion to the services they consume. Reauthorization of legislation that funds the FAA, which includes proposals regarding upgrades to the ATC system, has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. It is uncertain whether the U.S. Senate will act and whether such legislation will becomelaw. In the meantime, FAA funding continues under temporary periodic extensions.Many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations.  Concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, in particular, may result in the imposition of additional legislation or regulation.  The EU has adopted a directive under which each EU member state is required to extendthe existing EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) to aviation.  This will require us to have emission allowances in order to operate flights to and from EU member states in January 2012 and thereafter, including flights between the U.S. and EU member states.  In December 2009, the ATA, joined by American, Continental and United, filed a legal action in the United Kingdom challenging the implementation of the EU ETS as applied to aviation.  We believe that non-EU governments are alsolikely to consider formal challenges to the EU ETS as applied to aviation.  It is not clear whether the EU ETS will withstand such challenges.  However, unless interim relief is granted, we will be required to continue to comply with the EU ETS during the pendency of the legal challenges.  Although the cost of compliance with the EU ETS is difficult to predict given the uncertainty of a number of variables, such as the number and price of emission allowances we may be required topurchase, such costs could be significant.Other legislative or regulatory actions addressing climate change and emissions from aviation that may be taken in the future by the U.S., state or foreign governments may adversely affect our business and financial results.  Climate change legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress and by certain state legislatures,which include certain provisions that may affect the aviation industry.  In addition, the EPA has found that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.  Although this finding was not applied in the context of aviation, it is possible that the EPA could in the future regulate greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft.  It is currently unknown how climate change legislation or regulation, if enacted, would specifically apply to the aviation industry.  However, theimpact on us of any climate change legislation or regulation is likely to be adverse and related costs of compliance could be significant.  Such legislation or regulation could result in, among other things, increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, the imposition of requirements to purchase emission offsets or credits, and restrictions on the growth of airline operations.  We continue to evaluate ongoing climate change developments at the international, federal and state levels and assessthe potential associated impacts on our business and operations.We could be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks. Actual or threatened U.S. military involvement in overseas operations has, on occasion, had an adverse impact on our business, financial position (including access to capital markets) and results of operations, and on the airline industry in general. The continuing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, or other conflicts or events inthe Middle East or elsewhere, may result in similar adverse impacts. The Terrorist Attacks had a material adverse impact on us. The occurrence of another terrorist attack (whether domestic or international and whether against us or another entity) could again have a material adverse impact on us. Our international operations are subject to economic and political instability and could be adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control. Our current international activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such as reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls, currency and political risks (including changes in exchange rates and currency devaluations), environmental regulation, increases in taxes and fees and changes in internationalgovernment regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots. For example, the open skies air services agreement between the U.S. and the EU which took effect in March 2008 provides airlines from the U.S. and EU member states open access to each other’s markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly beyond the U.S. and any airport in the EU including London’s HeathrowAirport. The agreement has resulted in American facing increased competition in these markets, including Heathrow, where we have lost market share. In addition, in December 2009, the U.S. and Japan reached a tentative open skies air services agreement that provides airlines from the U.S. and Japan open access to each other’s markets.  If ratified, this agreement could significantly increase competition in the U.S. – Japan market.  Final approval of the agreement is contingent uponATI and the resolution of certain other issues.  We could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior. In the second quarter of 2009, there was an outbreak of the H1N1 virus which had an adverse impact throughout our network but primarily on our operations to and from Mexico. In 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which had an adverse impact primarily on our Asia operations. In addition, in the past therehave been concerns about outbreaks or potential outbreaks of other diseases, such as avian flu. Any outbreak of a disease (including a worsening of the outbreak of the H1N1 virus) that affects travel behavior could have a material adverse impact on us. In addition, outbreaks of disease could result in quarantines of our personnel or an inability to access facilities or our aircraft, which could adversely affect our operations. Our labor costs are higher than those of our competitors. Wages, salaries and benefits constitute a significant percentage of our total operating expenses. In 2009, they constituted approximately 33 percent of our total operating expenses. All of the major hub-and-spoke carriers with whom American competes have achieved significant labor cost savings through or outside of bankruptcy proceedings.We believe American’s labor costs are higher than those of its primary competitors, and it is unclear how long this labor cost disadvantage may persist.  These higher labor costs may adversely affect our ability to achieve and sustain profitability while competing with other airlines with lower labor costs.  Additionally, we cannot predict the outcome of our ongoing negotiations with our unionized work groups.  Significant increases in pay and benefits resulting from changesto our collective bargaining agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to have satisfactory relations with any unionized or other employee work group. Our business is labor intensive.  To the extent that we are unable to have satisfactory relations with any unionized or other employee work group, our operations and our ability to execute our strategic plans could be adversely affected. In addition, any disruption by an employee work group (e.g., sick-out, slowdown, full or partialstrike, or other job action) may materially adversely affect our operations and impair our financial performance.American is currently in mediated negotiations under the auspices of the NMB with each of its three major unions to amend their respective labor agreements. These negotiations are governed by the RLA, which prescribes no set timetable for the negotiations and mediation process. The negotiations and mediation process in the airline industrytypically is slow and sometimes contentious. The RLA prohibits the parties from engaging in self-help prior to the exhaustion of the RLA’s bargaining process.  That process is not exhausted until the NMB has declared the parties are at a bargaining impasse, one or both parties has declined the NMB’s proffer of binding arbitration, and a 30-day cooling off period has expired without the appointment of a Presidential Emergency Board.  If we are unable to reach agreement with anyof our unionized work groups, and the RLA’s bargaining process has been fully exhausted, we may be subject to lawful strikes, work stoppages or other job actions.    In addition, the union that represents American’s pilots has filed a number of grievances, lawsuits and complaints, most of which American believes are part of a corporate campaign related to the union’s labor agreement negotiations with American. While American is vigorously defending these claims, unfavorable outcomes of oneor more of them could require American to incur additional costs, change the way we conduct some parts of our business, or otherwise adversely affect us. Our insurance costs have increased substantially and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have an adverse impact on us. We carry insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage and all-risk coverage for damage to our aircraft. As a result of the Terrorist Attacks, aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers forclaims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in general. While the price of commercial insurance has declined since the period immediately after the Terrorist Attacks, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to us, or significantly increase its cost, we would be adversely affected.   The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines through August 31, 2010, covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. If the U.S. government were to cease providing such insurance in whole or in part, it is likely that we could obtain comparablecoverage in the commercial market, but we could incur substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if such coverage is available at all.  If we are unable to obtain adequate war-risk coverage at commercially reasonable rates, we would be adversely affected. We may be unable to retain key management personnel. We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our key management employees, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain them. Any inability to retain our key management employees, or attract and retain additional qualified management employees, could have a negative impact on us. We are increasingly dependent on technology and could be adversely affected by a failure or disruption of our computer, communications or other technology systems. We are heavily and increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business, reduce our costs and enhance customer service.  The computer and communications systems on which we rely could be disrupted due to various events, some of which are beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks,equipment failures, system implementation failures, software failures and computer viruses and hackers. We have taken certain steps to help reduce the risk of some (but not all) of these potential disruptions. There can be no assurance, however, that the measures we have taken are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions or failures of these systems. Any substantial or repeated failure of these systems could impact our operations and customer service, result in the loss of important data, loss of revenues, andincreased costs, and generally harm our business. Moreover, a failure of certain of our vital systems could limit our ability to operate our flights for an extended period of time, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and our business.  In addition, we will need to continue to make significant investments in technology to pursue initiatives to reduce costs and enhance customer service.  If we are unable to make these investments, our business could be negatively impacted. We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity which might result from an accident involving any of our aircraft. If one of our aircraft were to be involved in an accident, we could be exposed to significant tort liability. The insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate. In the event that our insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accidentinvolving an aircraft operated by us could adversely affect the public’s perception of us.Interruptions or disruptions in service at one or more of our primary market airports could have an adverse impact on us.Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at our primary market airports in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Chicago, Miami, New York City and Los Angeles.  Each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region around the primary market to other major cities.  Asignificant interruption or disruption in service at one or more of our primary markets could adversely impact our operations.The airline industry is heavily taxed.The airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue.  The U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries.  These fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights and various U.S. fees and taxes also areassessed on international flights.  In addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us, various fees and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent years.  Certain of these fees and taxes must be included in the fares we advertise or quote to our customers.  Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry ratherthan being passed on to the passenger.  Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel, and thus our revenues.  "
5,AAL,AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC,2007-02-23,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur ability to become consistently profitable and our ability to continue to fund our obligationson an ongoing basis will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond ourcontrol. Some of the factors that may have a negative impact on us are described below:As a result of significant losses in recent years, our financial condition has been materiallyweakened.Although we earned a profit in 2006, we incurred significant losses in recent prior years: $857million in 2005, $751 million in 2004, $1.2 billion in 2003, $3.5 billion in 2002 and $1.8 billionin 2001. As a result, our financial condition was materially weakened, and we remain vulnerableboth to unexpected events (such as additional terrorist attacks or a sudden spike in jet fuelprices) and to general declines in the operating environment (such as that resulting from arecession or significant increased competition).Our initiatives to generate additional revenues and to reduce our costs may not be adequate orsuccessful.As we seek to improve our financial condition, we must continue to take steps to generateadditional revenues and to reduce our costs. Although we have a number of initiatives underway toaddress our cost and revenue challenges, some of these initiatives involve changes to our businesswhich we may be unable to implement. In addition, we expect that, as time goes on, it may beprogressively more difficult to identify and implement significant revenue enhancement and costsavings initiatives. The adequacy and ultimate success of our initiatives to generate additionalrevenues and reduce our costs are not known at this time and cannot be assured. Moreover, whetherour initiatives will be adequate or successful depends in large measure on factors beyond ourcontrol, notably the overall industry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industrycapacity growth, and fuel prices. Given the competitive challenges we face and other factors, suchas high fuel prices, that are beyond our control, we must continue to aggressively pursue profitimprovement initiatives to achieve long-term success.Our business is affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, and ourresults of operations tend to be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality.Our business and our results of operations are affected by many changing economic and otherconditions beyond our control, including among others:  actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic,business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation and higher interestrates, war, terrorist attacks or political instability;   changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic trends;   changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other factors;   actual or potential disruptions to the air traffic control system;   increases in costs of safety, security and environmental measures;   outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; or   weather and natural disasters.As a result, our results of operations tend to be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpectedchange. In addition, due to generally greater demand for air travel during the summer, ourrevenues in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be stronger than revenues in thefirst and fourth quarters of the year.Our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could adversely affect our business andliquidity.We have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness and obligations to makefuture payments on aircraft equipment and property leases, and a high proportion of debt to equitycapital. We may incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and lease obligationsin the future. We also have substantial pension funding obligations. Our substantial indebtednessand other obligations could have important consequences. For example, they could:11Table of Contents  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capitalexpenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes, or adversely affect the terms onwhich such financing could be obtained;   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations topayments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds availablefor other purposes;   make us more vulnerable to economic downturns;   limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility inresponding to changing business and economic conditions; or   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and theindustry in which we operate.We may be unable to comply with our financial covenants.American has a fully drawn $740 million Credit Facility, which consists of a $295 million RevolvingFacility with a final maturity on June 17, 2009 and a $445 million Term Loan Facility with a finalmaturity on December 17, 2010. The Credit Facility contains a liquidity covenant and a ratio ofcash flow to fixed charges covenant. We complied with these covenants as of December 31, 2006 andexpect to be able to continue to comply with these covenants. However, given fuel prices that arehigh by historical standards and the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, it is difficult toassess whether we will, in fact, be able to continue to comply with these covenants, and there areno assurances that we will be able to do so. Failure to comply with these covenants would resultin a default under the Credit Facility which  if we did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, orotherwise mitigate, the default  could result in a default under a significant amount of ourother debt and lease obligations, and otherwise have a material adverse impact on us.We are being adversely affected by increases in fuel prices, and we would be adversely affected bydisruptions in the supply of fuel.Our results are very significantly affected by the price and availability of jet fuel, which are inturn affected by a number of factors beyond our control. Although fuel prices have moderatedsomewhat from the record high prices reached in July and August 2006, they are volatile and remainhigh by historical standards.Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, we may not be able to pass on increased fuelprices to customers by increasing fares. In fact, recent history would indicate that we havelimited ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel. If fuel prices decline in the future,increased fare competition and lower revenues may offset any potential benefit of lower fuelprices.While we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability, dependency onforeign imports of crude oil, limited refining capacity and the possibility of changes ingovernment policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible topredict the future availability of jet fuel. If there are additional outbreaks of hostilities orother conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere, or a reduction in refining capacity (due toweather events, for example), or governmental limits on the production or sale of jet fuel, therecould be reductions in the supply of jet fuel and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel.Major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases in its cost, or acontinuation of current high prices for a significant period of time, would have a material adverseimpact on us.While we seek to manage the price risk of fuel costs by using derivative contracts, there can be noassurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particularlevel of protection against increased fuel costs. In addition, a deterioration of our financialposition could negatively affect our ability to enter into derivative contracts in the future.12Table of ContentsThe airline industry is fiercely competitive and we are subject to increasing competition.Service over almost all of our routes is highly competitive and fares remain at low levels byhistorical standards. We face vigorous, and in some cases, increasing competition from majordomestic airlines, national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign air carriers,low-cost carriers and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation. We alsoface increasing and significant competition from marketing/operational alliances formed by ourcompetitors. The percentage of routes on which we compete with carriers having substantially loweroperating costs than ours has grown significantly over the past decade, and, as of December 31,2006, we now compete with low-cost carriers on approximately 82 percent of our domestic network.Certain alliances have been granted immunity from anti-trust regulations by governmentalauthorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extentalliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, ourability to effectively compete may be hindered.Pricing decisions are significantly affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discountingby competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we mustgenerally match competitors fares, since failing to match would result in even less revenue. Morerecently, we have faced increased competition from carriers with simplified fare structures, whichare generally preferred by travelers. Any fare reduction or fare simplification initiative may notbe offset by increases in passenger traffic, a reduction in costs or changes in the mix of trafficthat would improve yields. Moreover, decisions by our competitors that increase  or reduce overall industry capacity, or capacity dedicated to a particular domestic or foreign region, marketor route, can have a material impact on related fare levels.There have been numerous mergers and acquisitions within the U.S. airline industry since itsderegulation in 1978, and there may be additional mergers and acquisitions in the future. USAirways recent bid to purchase Delta, and other factors, could spur consolidation within theindustry in the near term. Any airline industry consolidation could substantially alter thecompetitive landscape and may result in changes in our corporate or business strategy. We cannotreliably predict the impact on us of, and our role in or response to, airline industryconsolidation.We compete with reorganized and reorganizing carriers, which may result in competitivedisadvantages for us or fare discounting.We must compete with air carriers that have recently reorganized or are reorganizing, includingunder the protection of Chapter 11, including United, the second largest U.S. air carrier, Delta,the third largest U.S. air carrier and Northwest, the fourth largest U.S. air carrier. It ispossible that other competitors may seek to reorganize in or out of Chapter 11. With the Chapter11 filings of Delta and Northwest, two out of the four largest U.S. air carriers are now operatingunder the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, with United having emerged from Chapter 11 in thefirst quarter of 2006. We cannot predict the outcome of any airline bankruptcy proceedings or theconsequences of such a large portion of the airline industrys capacity being provided by bankruptor recently reorganized air carriers.Successful reorganizations by other carriers present us with competitors with significantly loweroperating costs and a stronger financial position derived from renegotiated labor, supply, andfinancing contracts, which could lead to fare reductions. These competitive pressures may limitour ability to adequately price our services, may require us to further reduce our operating costs,and could have a material adverse impact on us.13Table of ContentsFares are at low levels and our reduced pricing power adversely affects our ability to achieveadequate pricing, especially with respect to business travel.While we have recently been able to implement some fare increases on certain domestic andinternational routes, our passenger yield remains low by historical standards. We believe this isdue in large part to a corresponding decline in our pricing power. Our reduced pricing power isthe product of several factors including: greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers(particularly business travelers); pricing transparency resulting from the use of the Internet;greater competition from low-cost carriers and from carriers that have recently reorganized or arereorganizing including under the protection of Chapter 11; other carriers being well hedged againstrising fuel costs and able to better absorb the current high jet fuel prices; and, more recently,fare simplification efforts by certain carriers. We believe that our reduced pricing power couldpersist indefinitely.We may need to raise additional funds to maintain sufficient liquidity, but we may be unable to doso on acceptable terms.To maintain sufficient liquidity as we continue to implement our restructuring and cost reductioninitiatives, and because we have significant debt, lease, pension and other obligations in the nextseveral years, we may need continued access to additional funding.Our ability to obtain future financing has been reduced because we have fewer unencumbered assetsavailable than in years past. A very large majority of our aircraft assets (including virtuallyall of our aircraft eligible for the benefits of Section 1110 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) havebeen encumbered. Also, the market value of our aircraft assets has declined in recent years andthose assets may not maintain their current market value.Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, which we refer to as the Terrorist Attacks, ourcredit ratings have been lowered to significantly below investment grade. These reductions haveincreased our borrowing costs and otherwise adversely affected borrowing terms, and limitedborrowing options. Additional reductions in our credit ratings could further increase borrowing orother costs and further restrict the availability of future financing.A number of other factors, including our financial results in recent years, our substantialindebtedness, the difficult revenue environment we face, our reduced credit ratings, high fuelprices, and the financial difficulties experienced in the airline industry, adversely affect theavailability and terms of financing for us. As a result, there can be no assurance that financingwill be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to obtain additionalfinancing on acceptable terms could have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability tosustain our operations over the long term.Our corporate or business strategy may change.In light of the rapid changes in the airline industry, we evaluate our assets on an ongoing basiswith a view to maximizing their value to us and determining which are core to our operations. Wealso regularly evaluate our corporate and business strategies, and they are influenced by factorsbeyond our control, including changes in the competitive landscape we face. Our corporate andbusiness strategies are, therefore, subject to change.Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which can result in increases in ourcosts, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, andcompetitive disadvantages.Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Many ofthese requirements result in significant costs. For example, the FAA from time to time issuesdirectives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft, andcompliance with those requirements drives significant expenditures. In addition, the ability ofU.S. carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicablearrangements between the United States and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, orbecause appropriate slots or facilities are not made available.14Table of ContentsMoreover, additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been enacted fromtime to time that have significantly increased the costs of airline operations, reduced the demandfor air travel or restricted the way we can conduct our business. For example, the Aviation andTransportation Security Act, which became law in 2001, mandated the federalization of certainairport security procedures and resulted in the imposition of additional security requirements onairlines. In addition, many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringentenvironmental regulations, and concerns about climate change, in particular, may result in theimposition of additional regulation. For example, the European Commission is currently seeking toimpose emissions controls on all flights coming into Europe. Laws or regulations similar to thosedescribed above or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions in the future may adversely affectour business and financial results.The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct ourbusiness each may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies,including:  changes in law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particularmarkets and at particular airports;   the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including foreign governmentapprovals) needed for codesharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines;   restrictions on competitive practices (for example court orders, or agency regulationsor orders, that would curtail an airlines ability to respond to a competitor);   the adoption of regulations that impact customer service standards (for example newpassenger security standards); or   the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions.In November 2005, the United States and the European Union reached a tentative air servicesagreement that would provide airlines from the United States and E.U. member states open access toeach others markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly beyond the United Statesand both within and beyond the E.U. The tentative agreement is subject to approval by the E.U.Transport Council of Ministers. Under the agreement, every U.S. and E.U. airline would beauthorized to operate between airports in the United States and Londons Heathrow Airport. Onlythree airlines besides American are currently allowed to provide that service and Heathrow routeshave historically been among our most profitable. The agreement, if approved, would result in ourfacing increased competition in serving Heathrow if additional carriers are able to obtainnecessary slots and terminal facilities.We could be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks.Actual or threatened U.S. military involvement in overseas operations has, on occasion, had anadverse impact on our business, financial position (including access to capital markets) andresults of operations, and on the airline industry in general. The continuing conflict in Iraq, orother conflicts or events in the Middle East or elsewhere, may result in similar adverse impacts.The Terrorist Attacks had a material adverse impact on us. The occurrence of another terroristattack (whether domestic or international and whether against us or another entity) could againhave a material adverse impact on us.Our international operations could be adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances orgovernment actions beyond our control.Our current international activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such asreversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls, currency and politicalrisks, taxation and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including theinability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots.15Table of ContentsWe could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior.In 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which primarily had anadverse impact on our Asia operations. More recently, there have been concerns about a potentialoutbreak of avian flu. If there were another outbreak of a disease (such as SARS or avian flu)that affects travel behavior, it could have a material adverse impact on us.Our labor costs are higher than our competitors.Wages, salaries and benefits constitute a significant percentage of our total operating expenses.In 2006, they constituted approximately 32 percent of our total operating expenses. All of themajor hub-and-spoke carriers with whom American competes have achieved significant labor costsavings through or outside of bankruptcy proceedings. We believe Americans labor costs are higherthan those of its primary competitors, and it is unclear how long this labor cost disadvantage maypersist.We could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relations with anyunionized or other employee work group.Our operations could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with anylabor union representing our employees. In addition, any significant dispute we have with, or anydisruption by, an employee work group could adversely impact us. Moreover, one of the fundamentaltenets of our strategic Turnaround Plan is increased union and employee involvement in ouroperations. To the extent that we are unable to maintain satisfactory relations with any unionizedor other employee work group, our ability to execute our strategic plans could be adverselyaffected.Our insurance costs have increased substantially and further increases in insurance costs orreductions in coverage could have an adverse impact on us.We carry insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage and all-risk coveragefor damage to our aircraft. As a result of the Terrorist Attacks, aviation insurers significantlyreduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability topersons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war orsimilar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these insurers significantly increased thepremiums for aviation insurance in general.The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlinesuntil August 31, 2007, covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. Ifthe U.S. government does not extend the policy beyond August 31, 2007, or if the U.S. government atanytime thereafter ceases to provide such insurance, or reduces the coverage provided by suchinsurance, we will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower scope from commercialinsurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is not available at commerciallyreasonable rates, we would be adversely affected.While the price of commercial insurance has declined since the period immediately after theTerrorist Attacks, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount ofinsurance coverage available to us, or significantly increase its cost, we would be adverselyaffected.We may be unable to retain key management personnel.Since the Terrorist Attacks, a number of our key management employees have elected to retire earlyor leave for more financially favorable opportunities at other companies, both within and outsideof the airline industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our keymanagement employees. Any inability to retain our key management employees, or attract and retainadditional qualified management employees, could have a negative impact on us.16Table of ContentsWe could be adversely affected by a failure or disruption of our computer, communications or othertechnology systems.We are heavily and increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business. The computer andcommunications systems on which we rely could be disrupted due to various events, some of which arebeyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipmentfailures, software failures and computer viruses and hackers. We have taken certain steps to helpreduce the risk of some (but not all) of these potential disruptions. There can be no assurance,however, that the measures we have taken are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions or failuresof these systems. Any substantial or repeated failure of these systems could impact our operationsand customer service, result in the loss of important data, loss of revenues, and increased costs,and generally harm our business. Moreover, a catastrophic failure of certain of our vital systems(which we believe is unlikely) could limit our ability to operate our flights for an extendedperiod of time, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and our business.17Table of Contents"
1,AAL,AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC,2006-02-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur ability to become profitable and our ability to continue to fund our obligations on an ongoingbasis will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond our control. Someof the factors that may have a negative impact on us are described below:As a result of significant losses in recent years, our financial condition has been materiallyweakened.We have incurred significant losses in recent years: $861 million in 2005, $761 million in 2004,$1.2 billion in 2003, $3.5 billion in 2002 and $1.8 billion in 2001. As a result, our financialcondition has been materially weakened, and we remain vulnerable both to unexpected events (such asadditional terrorist attacks or a sudden spike in jet fuel prices) and to general declines in theoperating environment (such as that resulting from a recession or significant increasedcompetition).Our initiatives to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce our costs may not beadequate or successful.As we seek to improve our financial condition, we must continue to take steps to generateadditional revenues and to significantly reduce our costs. Although we have a number ofinitiatives underway to address our cost and revenue challenges, a number of these initiativesinvolve significant changes to our business which we may be unable to implement. The adequacy andultimate success of our initiatives to generate additional revenues and significantly reduce ourcosts are not known at this time and cannot be assured. Moreover, whether our initiatives will beadequate or successful depends in large measure on factors beyond our control, notably the overallindustry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry capacity growth, and fuelprices. It will be very difficult, absent continued restructuring of our operations, for us tocontinue to fund our obligations on an ongoing basis, or to become profitable, if the overallindustry revenue environment does not continue to improve and fuel prices remain at historicallyhigh levels for an extended period.Our business is affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, and ourresults of operations tend to be volatile.Our business, and that of the rest of the airline industry, is affected by many changing economicand other conditions largely outside of our control, including among others:  actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic,business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation and higher interestrates, war, terrorist attacks or political instability;   changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic trends;   actual or potential disruptions to the air traffic control system;   increases in costs of safety, security and environmental measures;   outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; or   weather and natural disasters.As a result, our results of operations tend to be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpectedchange. In addition, many of the factors that can have a material impact on our business and ourresults of operations are beyond our control.11Table of ContentsOur indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could adversely affect our business andliquidity.We have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness and obligations to makefuture payments on aircraft equipment and property leases. We may incur substantial additionaldebt, including secured debt, and lease obligations in the future. We also have substantial, andincreasing, pension funding obligations. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations couldhave important consequences. For example, they could:  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capitalexpenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes, or adversely affect the terms onwhich such financing could be obtained;   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations topayments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds availablefor other purposes;   make us more vulnerable to economic downturns;   limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility inresponding to changing business and economic conditions; or   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and theindustry in which we operate.We may be unable to comply with our financial covenants.American has a fully drawn $788 million Credit Facility, which consists of a $540 million RevolvingFacility with a final maturity on June 17, 2009 and a $248 million Term Loan Facility with a finalmaturity on December 17, 2010. The Credit Facility contains a liquidity covenant and a ratio ofcash flow to fixed charges covenant. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31,2005 and expect to be able to continue to comply with these covenants for the period ending March31, 2006. However, given the historically high price of fuel and the volatility of fuel prices andrevenues, it is difficult to assess whether we will, in fact, be able to continue to comply withthese covenants, and there are no assurances that we will be able to comply with these covenants.Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the Credit Facility which -- - if we did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default  - couldresult in a default under a significant amount of our other debt and lease obligations, andotherwise adversely affect our business.We are being adversely affected by increases in fuel prices, and we would be adversely affected bydisruptions in the supply of fuel.Our results are very significantly affected by the price and availability of jet fuel. Fuel pricesincreased significantly in 2005 and remain high.Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, we may not be able to pass on increased fuelprices to customers by increasing fares. In fact, recent history would indicate that we havelimited ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel. If fuel prices decline in the future,increased fare competition and lower revenues may offset any potential benefit of lower fuelprices.While we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability, dependency onforeign imports of crude oil, limited refining capacity and the possibility of changes ingovernment policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible topredict the future availability of jet fuel. If there is an outbreak of hostilities or otherconflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere or a reduction in refining capacity (due to weatherevents, for example), there could be reductions in the supply of jet fuel and significant increasesin the cost of jet fuel. Major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increasesin its cost, or a continuation of current high prices for a significant period of time, wouldadversely affect our business.While we seek to manage the price risk of fuel costs by using derivative contracts, there can be noassurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in place to provide any particularlevel of protection against increased fuel costs. In addition, a deterioration of our financialposition could negatively affect our ability to enter into derivative contracts in the future.12Table of ContentsThe airline industry is fiercely competitive and fares are at historically low levels.Service over almost all of our routes is highly competitive and fares remain at historically lowlevels. We face vigorous, and in some cases, increasing competition from major domestic airlines,national, regional, all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign air carriers, LCCs, and, particularlyon shorter segments, ground and rail transportation. We also face increasing and significantcompetition from marketing/operational alliances formed by our competitors. In addition, thecompetitive landscape we face would be altered substantially by industry consolidation, includingmerger, equity investment and joint venture transactions. The percentage of routes on which wecompete with carriers having substantially lower operating costs than ours has grown significantlyover the past decade, and we now compete with LCCs on 75 percent of our domestic network.Certain alliances have been granted immunity from anti-trust regulations by governmentalauthorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extentalliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, ourability to effectively compete may be hindered.Pricing decisions are significantly affected by competition from other airlines. Fare discountingby competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we mustgenerally match competitors fares, since failing to match would result in even less revenue. Morerecently, we have faced increased competition from carriers with simplified fare structures, whichare generally preferred by travelers. Any fare reduction or fare simplification initiative may notbe offset by increases in passenger traffic, a reduction in costs or changes in the mix of trafficthat would improve yields. Moreover, decisions by our competitors that increase  or reduce overall industry capacity, or capacity dedicated to a particular domestic or foreign region, marketor route, can have a material impact on related fare levels.We compete with reorganized and reorganizing carriers, which may result in competitivedisadvantages for us or fare discounting.We must compete with air carriers that have recently reorganized or are reorganizing, includingunder the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, including United, the second largestU.S. air carrier, Delta, the third largest U.S. air carrier and Northwest, the fourth largest U.S.air carrier. It is possible that other competitors may seek to reorganize in or out of Chapter 11.With the Chapter 11 filings of Delta and Northwest, two out of the four largest U.S. air carriersare now operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, with United just having emerged fromChapter 11. We cannot reliably predict the outcome of these proceedings or the consequences ofsuch a large portion of the airline industrys capacity being provided by bankrupt or recentlyreorganized air carriers.Successful reorganizations by other carriers present us with competitors with significantly loweroperating costs and a stronger financial position derived from renegotiated labor, supply, andfinancing contracts, which could lead to fare reductions. These competitive pressures may limitour ability to adequately price our services, may require us to further reduce our operating costs,and could have a material adverse impact on us.Our reduced pricing power adversely affects our ability to achieve adequate pricing, especiallywith respect to business travel.Our passenger yield remains depressed by historical standards. We believe this depressed passengeryield is due in large part to a corresponding decline in our pricing power. Our reduced pricingpower is the product of several factors including: greater cost sensitivity on the part oftravelers (particularly business travelers); pricing transparency resulting from the use of theInternet; greater competition from LCCs and from carriers that have recently reorganized or arereorganizing including under the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; other carriersbeing well hedged against rising fuel costs and able to better absorb the current high jet fuelprices; and, more recently, fare simplification efforts by certain carriers. We believe that ourreduced pricing power will persist indefinitely and possibly permanently.13Table of ContentsWe need to raise additional funds to maintain sufficient liquidity, but we may be unable to do soon acceptable terms.To maintain sufficient liquidity as we continue to implement our restructuring and cost reductioninitiatives, and because we have significant debt, lease, pension and other obligations in the nextseveral years, we will need continued access to additional funding.Our ability to obtain future financing has been reduced because we have fewer unencumbered assetsavailable than in years past. A very large majority of our aircraft assets (including virtuallyall of the aircraft eligible for the benefits of Section 1110 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) havebeen encumbered. Also, the market value of our aircraft assets has declined in recent years andthose assets may not maintain their current market value.Since the Terrorist Attacks, our credit ratings have been lowered to significantly below investmentgrade. These reductions have increased our borrowing costs and otherwise adversely affectedborrowing terms, and limited borrowing options. Additional reductions in our credit ratings couldfurther increase borrowing or other costs and further restrict the availability of futurefinancing.A number of other factors, including our recent financial results, our substantial indebtedness,the difficult revenue environment we face, our reduced credit ratings, high fuel prices, and thefinancial difficulties experienced in the airline industry, adversely affect the availability andterms of financing for us. As a result, there can be no assurance that financing will be availableto us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to obtain additional financing on acceptableterms would have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain our operations overthe long term.Our business strategy may change.We evaluate our assets on an ongoing basis with a view to maximizing their value to us anddetermining which are core to our operations. We also regularly evaluate our business strategy.We may change our business strategy in the future and may not pursue our current goals.Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which can result in increases in ourcosts, limits on our operating flexibility and competitive disadvantages.Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Many ofthese requirements result in significant costs. For example, the FAA from time to time issuesdirectives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft, andcompliance with those requirements drives significant expenditures. In addition, the ability ofU.S. carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicablearrangements between the United States and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, orbecause appropriate slots or facilities are not made available.Moreover, additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been enacted fromtime to time that have significantly increased the costs of airline operations, reduced the demandfor air travel or restricted the way we can conduct our business. For example, the Aviation andTransportation Security Act, which became law in 2001, mandates the federalization of certainairport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airlines. Similar lawsor regulations or other governmental actions in the future may adversely affect our business andfinancial results.14Table of ContentsOur results of operations may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken bygovernmental agencies having jurisdiction over our operations, including:  changes in the law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines inparticular markets and at particular airports;   the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including foreign governmentapprovals) needed for codesharing alliances and other arrangements with other airlines;   restrictions on competitive practices (for example court orders, or agency regulationsor orders, that would curtail an airlines ability to respond to a competitor);   the adoption of regulations that impact customer service standards (for example newpassenger security standards); or   the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions.In November 2005, the United States and the European Union reached a tentative air servicesagreement that would provide airlines from the United States and E.U. member states open access toeach others markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly beyond the United Statesand both within and beyond the E.U. The tentative agreement is subject to approval by the E.U.Transport Council of Ministers. Under the agreement, every U.S. and E.U. airline would beauthorized to operate between airports in the United States and Londons Heathrow Airport. Onlythree airlines besides American are currently allowed to provide that service and Heathrow routeshave historically been among our most profitable. The agreement, if approved, would result in ourfacing increased competition in serving Heathrow if additional carriers are able to obtainnecessary slots and terminal facilities.We currently serve the Dallas/Fort Worth area solely from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport(DFW). Southwest Airlines is actively seeking repeal of the Wright Amendment, which is a law thatauthorizes flight operations at Dallas Love Field within limited geographic areas. In November2005, legislation was passed that added the State of Missouri to the areas that may be served toand from Love Field, and we subsequently announced that we plan to provide service at Love Field inorder to protect market share. Splitting our Dallas/Fort Worth operations between DFW and LoveField impairs the efficiency and profitability of our hub operations at DFW, and further expansionof the authorized geographic service areas could have an adverse financial impact on us.We could be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks.The increased threat of U.S. military involvement in overseas operations has, on occasion, had anadverse impact on our business, financial position (including access to capital markets) andresults of operations, and on the airline industry in general. Furthermore, during 2003, the warin Iraq had a significant adverse impact on international and domestic revenues and futurebookings. The continuing conflict in Iraq, or other conflicts or events in the Middle East orelsewhere, may result in similar adverse impacts.The Terrorist Attacks had a material adverse impact on us. The occurrence of another terroristattack (whether domestic or international and whether against us or another entity) could againhave a material adverse impact on us.Our international operations could be adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances orgovernment actions beyond our control.Our current international activities and prospects could be adversely affected by factors such asreversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange controls, currency and politicalrisks, taxation and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including theinability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots.15Table of ContentsWe could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior.In 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which primarily had anadverse impact on our Asia operations. More recently, there have been concerns about a potentialoutbreak of avian flu. If there were another outbreak of a disease (such as SARS or avian flu)that affects travel behavior, it could have a material adverse impact on us.We could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relations with anyunionized or other employee work group.Our operations could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with anylabor union representing our employees. In addition, any dispute we have with, or any disruptionby, an employee work group (outside the confines of a collective bargaining agreement) couldadversely impact us. Moreover, one of the fundamental tenets of our strategic Turnaround Plan isincreased union and employee involvement in our operations. To the extent we are unable tomaintain satisfactory relations with any unionized or other employee work group, our ability toexecute our strategic plans would be adversely affected.Our insurance costs have increased substantially and further increases in insurance costs orreductions in coverage could have an adverse impact on us.We carry insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage and all-risk coveragefor damage to our aircraft. As a result of the Terrorist Attacks, aviation insurers significantlyreduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability topersons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war orsimilar events (war-risk coverage). At the same time, these insurers significantly increased thepremiums for aviation insurance in general.The U.S. government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlinesuntil August 31, 2006, covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. Inaddition, the Secretary of Transportation may extend the policy until December 31, 2006, at hisdiscretion. However, there is no assurance that it will be extended. If the U.S. government doesnot extend the policy beyond August 31, 2006, we will attempt to purchase similar coverage withnarrower scope from commercial insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this coverage is notavailable at commercially reasonable rates, we would be adversely affected.While the price of commercial insurance has declined since the premium increase immediately afterthe Terrorist Attacks, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount ofinsurance coverage available to us, or significantly increase its cost, we would be adverselyaffected.We may be unable to retain key management personnel.Since the Terrorist Attacks, several of our key management employees have elected to retire earlyor leave for more financially favorable opportunities at other companies. There can be no assurancethat we will be able to retain our key management employees. Any inability to retain our keymanagement employees, or attract and retain additional qualified management employees, could have anegative impact on us.We could be adversely affected by a failure or disruption of our computer, communications or othertechnology systems.We are increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business. The computer andcommunications systems on which we rely could be disrupted due to events beyond our control,including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment failures, softwarefailures and computer viruses and hackers. We have taken certain steps to help reduce the risk ofsome (but not all) of these potential disruptions. There can be no assurance, however, that themeasures we have taken are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions or failures of these systems.Any substantial or repeated failure of these systems could impact our operations and customerservice, result in the loss of important data, loss of revenues, increased costs and generally harmour business. Moreover, a catastrophic failure of certain of our vital systems (which we believeis a remote possibility) could limit our ability to operate our flights for an indefinite period oftime, which would have a material adverse impact on our operations and our business.16Table of Contents"
