General  We are an equity real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in theownership, management, development and redevelopment of retail and mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2005, we owned or had a majority interest in 103 community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties comprisingapproximately 17.6 million square feet, located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States, as well as in California, and one apartment complex in Maryland. In total, the 103commercial properties were 96.3% leased at December 31, 2005. A joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned four neighborhood shopping centers totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet as of December 31, 2005. In total,the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 97.4% leased at December 31, 2005. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for38 consecutive years. Revenue, profit, total assets and other financial information of each reportable segment are described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in thefinancial statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.  We were founded in1962 as a real estate investment trust under the laws of the District of Columbia and reformed as a real estate investment trust in the state of Maryland in 1999. Our principal executive offices are located at 1626 East Jefferson Street, Rockville,Maryland 20852 and our telephone number is (301) 998-8100. Our Web site address is www.federalrealty.com. The information contained on our Web site is not a part of this report.  Business Objectives and Strategies  Our primarybusiness objective is to own, manage, acquire and redevelop a portfolio of quality retail properties, with the dominant property type being grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers, that will:     generate higher internal growth than our peers;     protect investor capital;     provide increasing cash flow for distributions to shareholders; and     provide potential for capital appreciation.  Ourtraditional focus has been and remains on grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers. Late in 1994, recognizing a trend of increased consumer acceptance of retailer expansion to main streets, we expanded our investment strategy toinclude street retail and mixed-use properties. The mixed-use properties are typically centered around a retail component but also include office, residential and/or hotel components.  Operating Strategies  Our core operating strategy isto actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker, underperforming tenants with stronger ones. Our properties are generallylocated in some of the most densely   3 populated and affluent areas of the country. In addition, because of the in-fill nature of our locations, our properties generally face less competition percapita than properties owned by our peers. These strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales, which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates, charge higher rental rates, and maintain steady rent growth, all of which increasethe value of our portfolio. Our operating strategies also include:     maintaining a diversified tenant base, thereby limiting exposure to any one tenants financial difficulties;     monitoring the merchandising mix of our tenant base to achieve a balance of strong national and regional tenants with local specialty tenants;     minimizing overhead and operating costs;     monitoring the physical appearance of our properties and the construction quality, condition and design of the buildings and other improvements located on our properties to maximizeour ability to generate higher rents and occupancy rates;     developing local and regional market expertise in order to capitalize on market and retailing trends;     leveraging the contacts and experience of our management team to build and maintain long-term relationships with tenants, investors and financing sources;    increasing rental rates through the renewal of expiring leases or the leasing of space to new tenants at higher rental rates while limiting vacancy and down-time; and    providing exceptional customer service.  Investing Strategies Our investment strategy is to deploy capital at risk-adjusted rates of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital inprojects that have potential for future income growth.  Our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories:    renovating, expanding, reconfiguring and/or retenanting our existing properties to take advantage of under-utilized land or existing square footage to increase our internal growthrate;     acquiring community and neighborhood shopping centers, located in densely populated or growing affluent areas where barriers to entry for further development are high, and that havepossibilities for enhancing operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration and/or retenanting;     renovating or expanding tenant spaces for tenants capable of producing higher sales, and therefore, paying higher rents, including expanding space available to an existing tenantthat is performing well but is operating out of an old or otherwise inefficient store format; and     acquiring, in partnership with longer term investors who contribute a substantial portion of the equity needed to acquire those properties, stabilized community and neighborhoodshopping centers, located in densely populated or growing affluent areas where barriers to entry for further development are high and that have limited potential for significant growth.  Investment Criteria  When we evaluate potentialredevelopment, retenanting, expansion and acquisition opportunities, we consider such factors as:     the expected returns in relation to our cost of capital as well as the anticipated risk we will face in achieving the expected returns;   4   the anticipated growth rate of operating income generated by the property;     the tenant mix at the property, tenant sales performance and the creditworthiness of those tenants;     the geographic area in which the property is located, including the population density and household incomes, as well as the population and income trends in that geographic area;    competitive conditions in the vicinity of the property, including competition for tenants and the ability to create competing properties through redevelopment, new construction orrenovation;     access to and visibility of the property from existing roadways and the potential for new, widened or realigned, roadways within the propertys trade area, which may affectaccess and commuting and shopping patterns;     the level and success of our existing investments in the market area;     the current market value of the land, buildings and other improvements and the potential for increasing those market values; and     the physical condition of the land, buildings and other improvements, including the structural and environmental condition.  Financing Strategies  Our financing strategy isdesigned to enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most cost-efficient way possible. Our financing strategy includes:     maintaining a prudent level of overall leverage and an appropriate pool of unencumbered properties that is sufficient to support our unsecured borrowings;    managing our exposure to variable-rate debt;     taking advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt, reduce interest costs and manage our debt maturity schedule;     selling properties that have limited growth potential or are not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio and redeploying the proceeds to redevelop, renovate, retenant and/orexpand our existing properties, acquire new properties or reduce debt; and     utilizing the most advantageous long-term source of capital available to us to finance redevelopment and acquisition opportunities, which may include:     the sale of our equity or debt securities through public offerings or private placements,     the incurrence of indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings,     the issuance of operating units in a new or existing downREIT partnership that is controlled and consolidated by us (generally operating units in a downREITpartnership are issued in exchange for a tax deferred contribution of property and these units receive the same distributions as our common shares and the holders have the right to exchange their units for cash or the same number of our commonshares, at our option), or     the use of joint venture arrangements.  Employees  At December 31, 2005, we had 278 full-time employees and 116 part-time employees. None of the employees is represented by a collective bargainingunit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.  Tax Status  We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1962. Asa REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on REIT   5 taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders. Under the internal revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, REITs are subjectto numerous organizational and operational requirements, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain) each year. We will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income (includingany applicable alternative minimum tax) at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less than 100% of REIT taxable income. We will also not be permitted to qualifyfor treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to certain state and local income andfranchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed REIT taxable income.  We have elected to treat certain of oursubsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Code. A TRS is subject tofederal and state income taxes. The sales of condominiums at Santana Row beginning in August 2005 are being conducted through a TRS. As a result of these condominium sales, our TRS incurred approximately $3.5 million of income taxes in 2005. Priorto 2005, our TRS activities were limited and they did not incur any significant income taxes.  Governmental Regulations Affecting Our Properties We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and similar laws, including:    the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA;     the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act;     the Federal Clean Water Act;     the Federal Clean Air Act;     the Toxic Substances Control Act;     the Occupational Safety & Health Act; and     the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The application ofthese laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of property-specific circumstances, including the current and former uses of the property, the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property. Undercertain environmental laws, principally CERCLA, we, as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned, may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances, asbestos-containing materials, or petroleumproduct releases at the property. We may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination, whether or not we knew of, or wereresponsible for, the contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. As the owner or operator of real estate,we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate. Such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. The presence ofcontamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  Neither existing environmental, health, safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and managementdoes not believe they will in the future. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past.   6 However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future. We have no currentplans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental, health, safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties.  Competition  Numerous commercial developers and realestate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties. Some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do, although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitorsin any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market. This competition may:     reduce the number of properties available for acquisition;     increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;     interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents, and     adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.  Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, and other forms of marketing of goods and services, such as direct mail, electronic commerce and telemarketing. This competition couldcontribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants.

ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS  This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-lookingstatements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Also, documents that we incorporate byreference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including documents that we subsequently file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the SEC, will contain forward-looking statements. When we refer to forward-lookingstatements or information, sometimes we use words such as may, will, could, should, plans, intends, expects, believes, estimates,anticipates and continues. In particular, the below risk factors describe forward-looking information. The risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not all-inclusive,   7 particularly with respect to possible future events. Many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe. Thesefactors include, but are not limited to the following:  Revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenantsare not successful.  Revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent andother charges due under their leases on a timely basis. Some of our leases provide for the payment, in addition to base rent, of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenantsand for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property. The amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants generally will depend in part on the success of our tenants retail operations, makingus vulnerable to general economic downturns and other conditions affecting the retail industry. Any reduction in our tenants ability to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcyprotection, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Our net income depends on the success and continued presence of ouranchor tenants.  Our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business, or the bankruptcy orinsolvency, of any anchor store or anchor tenant. Anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significantamounts of customers to a property. The closing of one or more anchor stores prior to the expiration of the lease for that store, or the termination of a lease by one or more of a propertys anchor tenants, could adversely affect that propertyand result in lease terminations by, or reductions in rent from, other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result. This could reduce our net income. We may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.  We derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants. We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, whether by their terms, as a result of a tenantbankruptcy or otherwise, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than currentlease terms. As a result, our results of operations and our net income could be reduced.  The amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed bythat debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition.  We have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31,2005, we had approximately $1.4 billion of debt outstanding. Of that outstanding debt, approximately $271 million was secured by 13 of our properties and approximately $149 million represented capital lease obligations on 11 of our properties. Inaddition, we own a 30% interest in a joint venture that had $47.2 million of debt secured by four properties as of December 31, 2005. In total, approximately $1.2 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2005, which includes all of ourproperty secured debt (including the property secured debt of the joint venture) and our capital lease obligations, is fixed rate debt. Our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur. We do not have a policylimiting the ratio of our debt to total capitalization or assets. The amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders. For example, it could:     require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, property acquisitions,redevelopments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future;     limit our ability to make distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares;   8   make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements;     require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on our variable rate, unhedged debt if interest rates rise;     limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business;     limit our ability to obtain any additional debt or equity financing we may need in the future for working capital, debt refinancing, capital expenditures, acquisitions,redevelopment or other general corporate purposes or to obtain such financing on favorable terms; and     limit our flexibility in conducting our business, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness will dependprimarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow fromoperations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs. If we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets or obtain additionalfinancing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs, including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust. We cannot assure you that any such refinancing, sale of assets or additional financingwould be possible on terms that we would find acceptable.  We are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt that could restrictour operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt.  Our credit facility and term loans include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. We are also required to comply with additional covenants that include, among other things, provisions:     relating to the maintenance of property securing a mortgage;     restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens;     restricting our ability to incur additional debt;     restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage;     restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates; and     restricting our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.  As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all of our other financial covenants. If we were to breach any of our debt covenants, including the covenants listed above, and did not cure the breach withinany applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. Many of our debt arrangements, includingour public notes and our credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain ofour other debt obligations. As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares.  Our development activities are inherently risky.  General. The ground-up development of improvements on real property, as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements, presents substantial risks. We generally do not intend to undertake  9 construction of any new large-scale mixed-use, ground-up development projects; however, we do intend to complete the development and construction ofremaining phases of projects we already have started, such as Bethesda Row in Bethesda, Maryland and Santana Row in San Jose, California, and may undertake development of other projects if it is justifiable on a risk-adjusted basis. If additionalphases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful, it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere, the risks associated with our remaining development activities include:     significant time lag between commencement and completion subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuation in the general economy;     failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms;     expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed;     inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of lease-up;     higher-than-estimated construction costs, including labor and material costs; and     possible delay in completion of the project because of a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or otherregulatory approvals, or acts of God (such as fires, earthquakes or floods).  Santana Row. Santana Row is our largestsingle investment, and if it is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2005, we had more than $450 million (net of fire insurance proceeds from the 2002fire at Santana Row) invested at Santana Row. That amount includes the costs associated with the construction of 256 residential units currently under development. We continue to develop a master plan for the remaining parcels at Santana Row. The success of Santana Row will depend on many factors which cannot be assured and are not entirely within our control. These factorsinclude, among others, the demand for retail and residential space, the cost of operations, including utilities and insurance, the availability and cost of capital and the general economy, particularly in and around the Silicon Valley. In addition,our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by delays or cost overruns in completing future phases of Santana Row, by an inability to achieve the market rents that were projected when the project was commenced, or byslower than projected lease-up of the project.  Of the residential units at Santana Row, 219 have either been sold or currently areclassified as held for sale. Our costs of operating the project could increase as a result of the sale of these units, which would reduce our net income from the project. In addition, the condominium associations governing those units have somerights to vote on budgets for Santana Row and some ability to impact the manner in which the project is operated which could adversely impact the success of the project or reduce our net income.  Redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected.  Our investment strategy is focused on the redevelopment and acquisition of community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by grocery stores, drugstores or high volume, value-oriented retailers thatprovide consumer necessities. The redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:     our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopmentmay be too short. As a result, the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer time;   10   we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify;     we may not be able to integrate any acquisitions into our existing operations successfully;     properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve within the time frames we project the occupancy or rental rates we project at the time we make the decision to invest, whichmay result in the properties failure to achieve the returns we projected;     our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired,which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs; and     our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail to reveal variousliabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost.  Our ability to grow will be limited ifwe cannot obtain additional capital.  Our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and theacquisition of additional properties. We believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because, in addition to other requirements, we are required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% ofour REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains) each year to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. As a result, we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital,which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. The debt could include mortgage loans from third parties or the sale of debt securities. Equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares. We cannot guarantee thatadditional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. Our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors, including the markets perception of our growth potential,our ability to pay dividends, and our current and potential future earnings. Depending on the outcome of these factors, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement thisstrategy.  Rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares. Of our approximately $1.4 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005, approximately $165 million bears interest at variable ratesand was unhedged. We also may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow, which could adversely affect ourability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders. Although we have in the past and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions as toa portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates, the amounts we are required to pay under the variable rate debt to which the hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of non-performance bythe counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market priceof our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost of issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares.  Our performance andvalue are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry.  Our economic performance and the value of our real estateassets, and, consequently, the value of our investments, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability topay distributions to our   11 shareholders will be adversely affected. As a real estate company, we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks:     economic downturns in the areas where our properties are located;     adverse changes in local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply or reduction in demand;     changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;     zoning or regulatory restrictions;     decreases in market rental rates;     weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses;     costs associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; and     increases in the cost of adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, associated with one or more properties, which may occur even whencircumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties, although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues.  Many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from our properties decreases.  Our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us. Costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs,generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. As a result, cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if atenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms. Under those circumstances, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs. Additionally, newproperties that we may acquire or develop may not produce any significant revenue immediately, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties untilthey are fully leased.  Competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants.  Numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition.This competition may:     reduce properties available for acquisition;     increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;     reduce rents payable to us;     interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants;     lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties; and     adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.  Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, and other forms of marketing of goods, such as direct mail, internet marketing and telemarketing. This competition could contribute tolease defaults and insolvency of tenants. If we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties, or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets, it could materially affect our ability to generate net income,service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders.   12 We may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.  Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In addition, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estateand to REITs in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets. We may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in theperformance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.  Ourinsurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.  We currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties, includinginsurance for liability, fire, flood, rental loss and acts of terrorism. We also currently carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties in California and environmental insurance on most of our properties. All of these policies containcoverage limitations. We believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located. We intend to obtain similarinsurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties.  The availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurancemay increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry. As a result, we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices. In addition, insurance companiesmay no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold, or, if offered, the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified. We therefore may cease to have insurancecoverage against certain types of losses and/or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in aproperty, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceedswill not occur in the future. If any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt seriously our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Also, due to inflation, changesin codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed. Events such as these could adversely affect our results ofoperations and our ability to meet our obligations, including distributions to our shareholders.  We may have limited flexibility in dealing with ourjointly owned investments.  Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assetsjointly with other persons or entities and as of February 28, 2006, excluding our joint venture with Clarion Lion Properties Fund, we hold eight shopping centers and five urban retail and mixed-use properties jointly with other persons. We maymake additional joint investments in the future. Our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks, including the possibility that our partners or co-investors might become bankrupt, that those partners or co-investors mighthave economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals, and that those partners or co-investors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions, orin opposition to our policies or objectives. Although we hold the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing co-investments as of February 28, 2006, we must obtain the consent of the co-investor or meet definedcriteria to sell or to finance five of these properties. Joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to ourshareholders. We may also be liable for the actions of our co-investors.  In addition, on July 1, 2004, we entered into a new jointventure with affiliates of Clarion Lion Properties Fund for purposes of acquiring properties. Although we are the managing general partner of that entity, we have only a 30% ownership interest in that entity. Our partners consent is requiredto take certain actions with respect   13 to the properties acquired by the venture, and as a result, we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect orincrease the value of the property or the propertys income stream. Pursuant to the terms of our partnership, we must obtain our partners consent to do the following:     enter into new anchor tenant leases, modify existing anchor tenant leases or enforce remedies against anchor tenants;     make certain repairs, renovations or other changes or improvements to properties; and     sell or finance the property with secured debt.  The terms of ourpartnership require that certain acquisition opportunities be presented first to the joint venture, which limits our ability to acquire properties for our own account which could, in turn, limit our ability to grow. Our investment in this jointventure is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments. As of December 31, 2005, this joint venture owned four properties.  Environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties.  All real property and theoperations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials, environmental protection and human health and safety. Under various federal, state and local laws,ordinances and regulations, we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate, and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous ortoxic substances. This liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release. The presence of contamination or the failure properly to remediatecontamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral. The costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. We arenot aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations taken as a whole. The uses of any of our properties priorto our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the property-specific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties. If we are subject to any material environmentalliabilities, the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations.  We cannot predictwhat other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future.Compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems. Our tenants, like many of their competitors, have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operatingexpenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations, which will adversely affect their potential profitability.  Generally, our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements. Our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmentalconditions on the property caused by the tenant. If a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply, we could be forced to pay these costs. If not addressed, environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell orre-lease the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments.  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 couldrequire us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties.  Our existing properties, as well as propertieswe may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with this Act. The requirements of this Act, or of other federal,state or local laws, also may   14 change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons. Future compliance with this Act mayrequire expensive changes to the properties.  The revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal, state and locallaws to which they are subject.  We and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, suchas local licensing requirements, consumer protection laws and state and local fire, life-safety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties. The leases typically require that each tenant comply with all regulations. Failure tocomply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties. Non-compliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant, couldrequire us to pay penalties or fines relating to any non-compliance, and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property.  Failure toqualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions.  We believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us tocontinue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). However, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future.  Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have beenissued under the Code. Certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived fromqualifying rents and other income. Satisfying this requirement could be difficult, for example, if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents. Also, we must make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90%of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains). In addition, new legislation, new regulations, new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or thefederal income tax consequences of such qualification.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT:     we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income;     we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;     we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax;     unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we weredisqualified;     we could be required to pay significant income taxes, which would substantially reduce the funds available for investment or for distribution to our shareholders for each year inwhich we failed or were not permitted to qualify; and     we would no longer be required by law to make any distributions to our shareholders.  We may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a REIT.  As a REIT, we must make annualdistributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains). We are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain. In addition, we would be subject to a 4%excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income, capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years.   15 We intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the Codes distribution provisionsand to avoid federal income and excise tax. We may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because:     our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income; and     non-deductible capital expenditures, creation of reserves, or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income.  In these circumstances, we might have to borrow funds on unfavorable terms and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the marketconditions make borrowing financially unattractive.  To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own. The Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of ouroutstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code). To protect our REIT status, our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning (actually orconstructively) more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares. The constructive ownership rules are complex. Shares of our capital stock owned, actually or constructively, by agroup of related individuals and/or entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares and/or a class or series ofpreferred shares (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity (or another) to own constructively more than 9.8% in value of theoutstanding stock. If that happened, either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 9.8% ownership limit.  The Board of Trustees may waive these restrictions on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the Board of Trustees and two-thirds of our shareholderseligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The 9.8% ownership restrictions may delay, defer or preventa transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders best interest.  We cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.  Our ability to continue to pay dividends on ourcommon shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate, and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities, will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:    our financial condition and results of future operations;     the performance of lease terms by tenants;     the terms of our loan covenants; and     our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.  If we do not maintain or increase the dividend rate on our common shares, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities.Any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares. Conversely, payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment infull of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer.   16 Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law, as applicable to MarylandREITs, may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay orprevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:     the REIT ownership limit described above;     authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers, preferences or rights to be determined by the Board of Trustees;     a staggered, fixed-size Board of Trustees consisting of three classes of trustees;     special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, by one-third of the trustees or by shareholderspossessing no less than 25% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;     the Board of Trustees, without a shareholder vote, can classify or reclassify unissued shares of beneficial interest, including the reclassification of common shares into preferredshares and vice-versa;     a two-thirds shareholder vote is required to approve some amendments to the declaration of trust;     advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings; and     a shareholder rights plan that provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, our shareholders will be entitled to purchase from us a number of common shares equalin value to two times the purchase price, which initially will be equal to $65 per share, subject to certain adjustments.  Inaddition, if we elect to be governed by it in the future, the Maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control. Under Maryland law, unless a REIT elects not to be subject to this law, control sharesacquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers ortrustees who are employees of the REIT. Control shares are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power. A control share acquisition meansthe acquisition of control shares, with some exceptions.  Our bylaws state that the Maryland control share acquisition law will not applyto any acquisition by any person of our common shares. This bylaw provision may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares, by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote,and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition.  We may amend orrevise our business policies without your approval, and we have adopted a business plan that involves changes in our operational policies.  Our Board of Trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval. Our investment, financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities, such as growth, debt, capitalization andoperations, are determined by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion. A change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and resultsof operations, and the market price of our securities.  The current business plan adopted by our Board of Trustees focuses on ourinvestment in neighborhood and community shopping centers, principally through redevelopments and acquisitions. If this business plan is not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  17 Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-lookingstatements that we make, including those in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as may be required by law, we make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
