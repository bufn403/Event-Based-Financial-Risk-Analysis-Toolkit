The information on our website is available for information purposes only and is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.4Overnight Air Cargo.The Company’s Overnight Air Cargo segment comprises the operations of MAC, CSA and WASI. MAC and CSA have a relationship with FedEx spanning over 40 years and represent two of nine companies in the U.S. that have North American feeder airlines under contract with FedEx. MAC and CSA operate and maintain Cessna Caravan, Sky Courier, ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft that fly daily small-package cargo routes throughout the eastern United States and upper Midwest, and in the Caribbean. MAC and CSA’s revenues are derived principally pursuant to “dry-lease” service contracts with FedEx. In these “dry- lease"" contracts, FedEx provides the aircraft while MAC and CSA provide their own crew and exercise operational control of their flights.On June 1, 2021, MAC and CSA entered into new dry-lease agreements with FedEx which together cover all of the aircraft operated by MAC and CSA and replaced all prior dry-lease service contracts. These dry-lease agreements provide for the lease of specified aircraft by MAC and CSA in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased, which monthly rent reflected an estimate of a fair market rental rate. These dry-lease agreements provide that FedEx determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by MAC and CSA, with all other operational decisions made by MAC and CSA, respectively. The current dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement of MAC and CSA’s costs by FedEx, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. The current dry-lease agreement was most recently renewed on June 1, 2021 and is set to expire on August 31, 2026. The dry-lease agreements may be terminated by FedEx or MAC and CSA, respectively, at any time upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, each of the dry-lease agreements provides that FedEx may terminate the agreement upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes MAC or CSA’s only customer, or MAC or CSA employs fewer than six employees. As of the date of this report, FedEx would be permitted to terminate each of the dry-lease agreements under this provision. The Company believes that the short-term nature of its agreements with FedEx is standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry, where performance is measured on a daily basis.As of March 31, 2023, MAC and CSA had an aggregate of 85 aircraft under its dry-lease agreements with FedEx. Included within the 85 aircraft, 2 Cessna Caravan aircraft are considered soft-parked. Soft-parked aircraft remain covered under our agreements with FedEx although at a reduced administrative fee compared to aircraft that are in operation. MAC and CSA continue to perform maintenance on soft-parked aircraft, but they are not crewed and do not operate on scheduled routes.Revenues from MAC and CSA’s contracts with FedEx accounted for approximately 36% and 41% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The loss of FedEx as a customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. MAC and CSA are not contractually precluded from providing services to other parties and MAC occasionally provides third-party maintenance services to other airline customers and the U.S. military.MAC and CSA operate under separate aviation certifications. MAC is certified to operate under Part 121, Part 135 and Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA. These certifications permit MAC to operate and maintain aircraft that can carry a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds on the Cessna Caravan 208B under Part 135 and a maximum cargo capacity of 14,000 pounds for the ATR-42 and 17,800 pounds for the ATR-72 aircraft under Part 121. The maximum payload (cargo capacity) for the Cessna 408 operated under Part 135 is 6,000 pounds. The maximum structural payload (cargo capacity) for the ATR72-600F operated under Part 121 is 20,281 pounds. CSA is certified to operate and maintain aircraft under Part 135 of the FAA regulations. This certification permits CSA to operate aircraft with a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds.MAC and CSA, together, operated the following FedEx-owned cargo aircraft as of March 31, 2023:Type of AircraftModel YearForm of OwnershipNumberofAircraftCessna Caravan 208B (single turbo prop)1985-1996Dry lease61 Cessna SkyCourier 408 (twin turbo prop)2022-2023Dry lease4 ATR-42 (twin turbo prop)1992Dry lease9 ATR-72 (twin turbo prop)1992Dry lease10 ATR-72-600 (twin turbo prop)2022-2023Dry lease1 85 The Cessna Caravan 208B aircraft are maintained under an FAA Approved Aircraft Inspection Program (“AAIP”). The inspection intervals range from 100 to 200 hours. The current engine overhaul period on the Cessna aircraft is 8,000 hours.5The ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft are maintained under a FAA Part 121 continuous airworthiness maintenance program. The program consists of A and C service checks as well as calendar checks ranging from weekly to 12 years in duration. The engine overhaul period is 6,000 hours.The Cessna Caravan 408 aircraft are maintained under an FAA Approved AAIP.  The inspection program consists of 400 to 5,600 flight hour checks and 18 month to 120 month calendar checks.MAC and CSA operate in a niche market within a highly competitive contract cargo carrier market. MAC and CSA are two of  nine carriers that operate within the United States as FedEx feeder carriers. MAC and CSA are benchmarked against the other five FedEx feeders based on safety, reliability, compliance with federal, state and applicable foreign regulations, price and other service-related measurements. The Company believes accurate industry data is not available to indicate the Company’s position within its marketplace (in large measure because all of the Company’s direct competitors are privately held), but management believes that MAC and CSA, combined, constitute the largest contract carrier of the type described.FedEx conducts periodic audits of MAC and CSA, and these audits are an integral part of the relationship between the carrier and FedEx. The audits test adherence to the dry-lease agreements and assess the carrier’s overall internal control environment, particularly as related to the processing of invoices of FedEx-reimbursable costs. The scope of these audits typically extends beyond simple validation of invoice data against the third-party supporting documentation. The audit teams generally investigate the operator’s processes and internal control procedures. The Company believes satisfactory audit results are critical to maintaining its relationship with FedEx. The audits conducted by FedEx are not designed to provide any assurance with respect to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and investors, in evaluating the Company’s consolidated financial statements, should not rely in any way on any such examination of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.On January 31, 2023, the Company acquired WASI, an aircraft repair station that began operating in 1986. WASI is a certified FAA/EASA part 145 repair station (no. OWRF547L) and specializes in medium passenger regional jets, regional/commuter turboprops, cargo and special mission operators. It maintains a fully equipped engine shop with tooling and engine run stands. Services of WASI include inspections, contract maintenance, refurbishment, structural repairs and modifications, avionics, engine service refurbishment and upgrades.The Company’s overnight air cargo operations are not materially seasonal.Ground Equipment Sales.GGS is located in Olathe, Kansas and manufactures, sells and services aircraft deicers and other specialized equipment sold to domestic and international passenger and cargo airlines, ground handling companies, the United States Air Force (“USAF”), airports and industrial customers. GGS’s product line includes aircraft deicers, scissor-type lifts, military and civilian decontamination units, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other specialized equipment. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, sales of deicing equipment accounted for approximately 85% of GGS’s revenues, compared to 88% in the prior fiscal year.GGS designs and engineers its products. Components acquired from third-party suppliers are used in the assembly of its finished products. Components are sourced from a diverse supply chain. The primary components for mobile deicing equipment are the chassis (which is a commercial medium or heavy-duty truck), the fluid storage tank, a boom system, the fluid delivery system and heating equipment. The price of these components is influenced by raw material costs, principally high-strength carbon steels and stainless steel. GGS utilizes continuous improvements and other techniques to improve efficiencies and designs to minimize product price increases to its customers, to respond to regulatory changes, such as emission standards, and to incorporate technological improvements to enhance the efficiency of GGS’s products. Improvements have included the development of single operator mobile deicing units to replace units requiring two operators, a patented premium deicing blend system and a more efficient forced-air deicing system.GGS manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from 700 to 2,800 gallons. GGS also offers fixed-pedestal-mounted deicers. Each model can be customized as requested by the customer, including single operator configuration, fire suppressant equipment, open basket or enclosed cab design, a patented forced-air deicing nozzle, on-board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage, and color and style of the exterior finish. GGS also manufactures five models of scissor-lift equipment, for catering, cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft, and has developed a line of decontamination equipment, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other special purpose mobile equipment. GGS competes primarily on the basis of the quality and reliability of its products, prompt delivery, service and price. The market for aviation ground service equipment is highly competitive. Certain of GGS' competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do. These entities or investors may be able to accept more risk than the Company believes is in our best interest. In addition, the market for aviation ground services in the past has typically been directly related to the financial health of the aviation industry, weather patterns and changes in technology.GGS’s mobile deicing equipment business has historically been seasonal, with revenues typically being lower in the fourth and first fiscal quarters as commercial deicers are typically delivered prior to the winter season. The Company has continued its 6efforts to reduce GGS’s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its international and domestic customer base and its product line.In October 2021, GGS was awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF. This agreement renewed GGS' original agreement with the USAF entered in July 2009. Per the contract, GGS had to provide annual pricing for each one-year period during the duration of the contract. Further, based upon volume of commercial items purchased during that year, there may be discounts calculated into the pricing and are reflective of the submitted pricing. With all option years expected to be executed by the government, this contract would expire on October 21, 2027.GGS sold a total of 14 and 7 deicers under the current contract with the USAF including both GL 1800 and ER 2875 models during fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively and all the units were accepted by the USAF. GGS has already received confirmed orders of 6 deicers for fiscal 2024’s delivery order and currently expects the delivery of both GL 1800 and ER 2875 models to begin in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.Commercial Jet Engines and Parts.Contrail and Jet Yard (acquired during fiscal year 2017), AirCo (formed in May 2017), Worthington (acquired in May 2018),  Jet Yard Solutions (formed in January 2021), Air'Zona (acquired in March 2021), LGSS (formed March 2022), and Crestone Air Partners (""Crestone"", formed April 2022) comprises the commercial jet engines and parts segment of the Company’s operations. Contrail is a commercial aircraft trading, leasing and parts solutions provider. Its primary focus revolves around the CFM International CFM56-3/-5/-7 engines and the International Aero Engines V2500A5 engine, which power the two most prevalent narrow body, single aisle aircraft that are currently flown commercially—the Boeing 737 Classic / 737 NG and the Airbus A320 family. Contrail acquires commercial aircraft, jet engines and components for the purposes of sale, trading, leasing and disassembly/overhaul. Contrail holds an ASA-100 accreditation from the Aviation Suppliers Association.Jet Yard and Jet Yard Solutions offer commercial aircraft storage, storage maintenance and aircraft disassembly/part-out services at facilities leased at the Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona. The prevailing climate in this area of Arizona provides conditions conducive to long-term storage of aircraft. Jet Yard Solutions is registered to operate a repair station under Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA. Jet Yard leases approximately 48.5 acres of land under a lease agreement with Pinal County, Arizona. Jet Yard was organized in 2014, entered into the lease in June 2016 and had maintained de minimus operations from formation through the date it was acquired by the Company. Effective January 1, 2021, Jet Yard subleased the aforementioned lease with Pinal County to Jet Yard Solutions.AirCo operates an established business offering commercial aircraft parts sales, exchanges, procurement services, consignment programs and overhaul and repair services. AirCo Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AirCo (""AirCo Services""), holds FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency certifications covering aircraft instrumentation, avionics and a range of electrical accessories for civilian, military transport, regional/commuter and business/commercial jet and turboprop aircraft. Customers of AirCo include airlines and commercial aircraft leasing companies. Worthington Aviation, like AirCo, operates an established business which supplies spare parts, repair programs and aircraft maintenance services to the global aviation community of regional and business aircraft fleets. Worthington offers a globally networked infrastructure and 24/7 support, ensuring fast delivery of spare parts and service, with four locations strategically located in the United States, United Kingdom & Australia. In addition, Worthington operates two FAA and EASA Certificated repair stations. The Tulsa maintenance, repair and overhaul (""MRO"") facility provides composite aircraft structures, repair and support services. As a strategic resource for flight control, exhaust system and line replacement components, Worthington offers a wide array of services for complex operations. At the Eagan, Minnesota-based Repair Station, Worthington repair services offers a wide range of capabilities for repair and overhaul of airframe, accessories and power plant components in support of external as well as internal sales.Air'Zona is a full service Fixed Base Operator, located on field at Kingman Airport (IGM) in Kingman, Arizona that provides aircraft service and maintenance. LGSS delivers landing gear focused asset management and technical and commercial services worldwide. Crestone invests in commercial jet aircraft and engines on behalf of capital partners and provides full-service aviation asset management. The revenues of Air'Zona, LGSS, and Crestone are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company’s commercial jet engines and parts operations are not materially seasonal.Backlog.GGS’s backlog consists of “firm” orders supported by customer purchase orders for the equipment sold by GGS. At March 31, 2023, GGS’s backlog of orders was $13.6 million, all of which GGS expects to be filled in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. At March 31, 2022, GGS’s backlog of orders was $14.0 million. Backlog is not meaningful for the Company’s other business segments.Governmental Regulation.7The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies.The Department of Transportation (“DOT”) has the authority to regulate air service. The DOT has authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations, and may, in certain circumstances, assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority and seek criminal sanctions.Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires MAC and CSA to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.The FAA has safety jurisdiction over flight operations generally, including flight equipment, flight and ground personnel training, examination and certification, certain ground facilities, flight equipment maintenance programs and procedures, examination and certification of mechanics, flight routes, air traffic control and communications and other matters. The FAA is concerned with safety and the regulation of flight operations generally, including equipment used, ground facilities, maintenance, communications and other matters. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness. The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations. The Company, through its subsidiaries, holds all operating airworthiness and other FAA certificates that are currently required for the conduct of its business, although these certificates may be suspended or revoked for cause. The FAA periodically conducts routine reviews of MAC and CSA’s operating procedures and flight and maintenance records.The FAA has authority under the Noise Control Act of 1972, as amended, to monitor and regulate aircraft engine noise. The aircraft operated by the Company are in compliance with all such regulations promulgated by the FAA. Moreover, because the Company does not operate jet aircraft, noncompliance is not likely. Aircraft operated by us also comply with standards for aircraft exhaust emissions promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended.Jet Yard, Jet Yard Solutions, AirCo, and WASI, like Worthington, operate repair stations licensed under Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA. These certifications must be renewed annually, or in certain circumstances within 24 months. Certified repair stations are subject to periodic FAA inspection and audit. The repair station may not be relocated without written approval from the FAA.Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft operations, the Company is also subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended.Maintenance and Insurance.The Company, through its subsidiaries, is required to maintain the aircraft it operates under the appropriate FAA and manufacturer standards and regulations.The Company has secured public liability and property damage insurance in excess of minimum amounts required by the United States Department of Transportation.The Company maintains cargo liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance and fire and extended coverage insurance for owned and leased facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company maintains product liability insurance with respect to injuries and loss arising from use of products sold and services provided.In March 2014, the Company formed SAIC, a captive insurance company licensed in Utah. SAIC insures risks of the Company and its subsidiaries that were not previously insured by the various Company insurance programs (including the risk of loss of key customers and contacts, administrative actions and regulatory changes); and may from time to time underwrite third-party risk through certain reinsurance arrangements. SAIC is included within the Company's Corporate and other segment.Employees and Human Capital Resources.As of March 31, 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries had 584 full-time and full-time-equivalent employees. None of the employees of the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries are represented by labor unions. The Company believes its relations with its employees are good.We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. As it relates to our employees:Oversight and Management8Our executive officers are tasked with leading our organization in managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, talent management and development. We are committed to providing team members with the training and resources necessary to continually strengthen their skills. Our executive team is responsible for periodically reviewing team member programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices. Management periodically reports to the Board regarding our human capital measures and results that guide how we attract, retain and develop a workforce to enable our business strategies.Diversity, Equity and InclusionWe believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to monitor and improve the application of our hiring, retention, compensation and advancement processes for women and underrepresented populations across our workforce, including persons of color, veterans and LGBTQ to enhance our inclusive and diverse culture. We plan to invest in recruiting diverse talent.Workplace Safety and HealthA vital part of our business is providing our workforce with a safe, healthy and sustainable working environment. We focus on implementing change through workforce observation and feedback channels to recognize risk and continuously improve our processes.Importantly during fiscal years 2020 through 2022, our focus on providing a positive work environment on workplace safety have enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. We took immediate action at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to enact rigorous safety protocols in our facilities by improving sanitation measures, implementing mandatory social distancing, use of facing coverings, reducing on-site workforce through staggered shifts and schedules, remote working where possible, and restricting visitor access to our locations. We believe these actions helped minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce.Item 1B.    Risk Factors
General Business RisksMarket fluctuations may affect our operations.Market fluctuations may affect our ability to obtain funds necessary for the operation of our businesses from current lenders or new borrowings. In addition, we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. Third-party reports relating to market studies or demographics we obtained previously also may no longer be accurate or complete. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events or any other related matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and the overall value of our assets.Rising inflation may result in increased costs of operations and negatively impact the credit and securities markets generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.Inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally due in part to global supply chain issues, the increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, the Ukraine-Russia war, a rise in energy prices, and strong consumer demand. An inflationary environment can increase our cost of labor, as well as our other operating costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, economic conditions could impact and reduce the number of customers who purchase our products or services as credit becomes more expensive or unavailable. Although interest rates have increased and may increase further, inflation may continue. Further, increased interest rates could have a negative effect on the securities markets generally which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our ability to sell additional trust preferred securities.We could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses.We compete with many other organizations for skilled management and staff employees, including organizations that operate in different market sectors than us. Costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations.Legacy technology systems require a unique technical skillset which is becoming scarcer.The Company deploys legacy technology systems in several significant business units. As technology continues to rapidly change, the available pool of individuals technically trained in and able to repair or perform maintenance on these legacy systems shrinks. As this scarcity increases, the Company’s ability to efficiently and quickly repair its legacy systems becomes increasingly difficult, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s day-to-day operations.Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.9We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business. We store sensitive data and proprietary information on these systems. Threats to these systems, and the laws and regulations governing security of data, including personal data, on information systems and otherwise held by companies is evolving and adding layers of complexity in the form of new requirements and increasing costs of attempting to protect information systems and data and complying with new cybersecurity regulations. Information systems are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our information systems, computer technology, and business. Global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information systems and computer technology to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats and ransomware. The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions, ransom payments, and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations. Further, our technology resources may be strained due to an increase in the number of remote users. In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We sustained a cybersecurity attack in May 2022 involving ransomware that caused a network disruption and impacted certain of our systems. Upon detection, we undertook steps to address the incident, including engaging a team of third-party forensic experts and notifying law enforcement. We restored network systems and resumed normal operations. We have taken actions to improve our existing systems such as adding multi-factor authentication and to improve employee training and security competency. While we do not believe this event or resultant actions will have a material adverse effect on our business, this or similar incidents, or any other such breach of our data security infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Although we maintain cybersecurity liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify us for any liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability or litigation costs that are not covered by insurance could harm our business.We may not be able to insure certain risks adequately or economically.We cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur, or if we are required to pay a deductible for an insured loss, results of operations could be adversely affected.Legal liability may harm our business.Many aspects of our businesses involve substantial risks of liability, and, in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our businesses, including expansions into new products or markets, impose greater risks of liability. In addition, unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our businesses and our prospects. Although our current assessment is that there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact, if our assessment proves to be in error, then the outcome of such litigation could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Our business might suffer if we were to lose the services of certain key employees.Our business operations depend upon our key employees, including our executive officers. Loss of any of these employees, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses as our key employees have knowledge of our businesses, the industries they operate in and customers that would be difficult to replace.Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by global public health issues or similar events.During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, and to a lesser extent during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, the Company’s operations were impacted by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Company has had to navigate the impact it had on employees, supply chains and the economy in general and the aviation industry in particular. The Company is unable at this time to predict the impact that a global health crisis or similar event would have on its businesses, financial position and operating results in future periods due to numerous uncertainties. A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our centers could adversely impact our business.If a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, including new COVID-19 variants, or other public health crisis were to affect the areas in which we operate, our business, including our revenue, profitability and cash flows, could be 10adversely affected. Further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease might adversely impact our business by causing temporary shutdowns of our businesses or by causing staffing shortages. We may be unable to locate replacement supplies, and ongoing delays could require us to reduce business operations. Although we have disaster plans in place, the extent to which new COVID-19 variants or other public health crisis will impact our business is difficult to predict and will depend on many factors beyond our control, including the speed of contagion, the development and implementation of effective preventative measures and possible treatments, the scope of governmental and other restrictions on travel and other activity, and public reactions to these factors.Risks Related to Our Segment OperationsThe operating results of our four segments may fluctuate, particularly our commercial jet engine and parts segment.The operating results of our four segments have varied from period to period and comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful. Due to a number of factors, including the risks described in this section, our operating results may fluctuate. These fluctuations may also be caused by, among other things:a.the economic health of the economy and the aviation industry in general;b.FedEx’s demand for the use of the services of our Air Cargo segment; c.the timing and number of purchases and sales of engines or aircraft;d.the timing and amount of maintenance reserve revenues recorded resulting from the termination of long term leases, for which significant amounts of maintenance reserves may have accumulated;e.the termination or announced termination of production of particular aircraft and engine types;f.the retirement or announced retirement of particular aircraft models by aircraft operators;g.the operating history of any particular engine, aircraft or engine or aircraft model;h.the length of our operating leases; andi.the timing of necessary overhauls of engines and aircraft.These risks may reduce our operating segment’s results including particularly our commercial jet engines and parts segment.  These risks may reduce the commercial jet engines and parts segment’s engine utilization rates, lease margins, maintenance reserve revenues and proceeds from engine sales, and result in higher legal, technical, maintenance, storage and insurance costs related to repossession and the cost of engines being off-lease. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the availability of engines for lease or sale periodically experiences cycles of oversupply and undersupply of given engine models and generally. The incidence of an oversupply of engines may produce substantial decreases in engine lease rates and the appraised and resale value of engines and may increase the time and costs incurred to lease or sell engines. We anticipate that supply fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. As a result, comparisons to results from preceding periods may not be meaningful and results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.Our Air Cargo Segment is dependent on a significant customer.Our Air Cargo business is significantly dependent on a contractual relationship with FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”), the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, 36% of our consolidated operating revenues, and 98% of the operating revenues for our overnight air cargo segment, arose from services we provided to FedEx. While FedEx has been our customer since 1980 under similar terms, our current agreements may be terminated by FedEx upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, FedEx may terminate the dry-lease agreement with MAC or CSA upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes its only customer, or either MAC or CSA employs less than six employees. As of the date of issuance of this report, FedEx would be permitted to terminate each of the dry-lease agreements under this provision. The loss of these contracts with FedEx would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Our dry-lease agreements with FedEx subject us to operating risks.Our dry-lease agreements with FedEx provide for the lease of specified aircraft by us in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased. The dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of our costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Under the dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by us in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are borne solely by us.  An increase in unreimbursed operational costs would negatively affect our results of operations.Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations.Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. These risks are discussed in FedEx’s periodic reports filed with the SEC including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. These risks include but are not limited to the following:•Economic conditions and anti-trade measures/trade policies and relations in the global markets in which it operates;•Additional changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally and adversely affect its business and results of operations.•The price and availability of fuel.11•Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand;•Potential disruption to operations resulting from a significant data breach or other disruption to FedEx’s technology infrastructure;•The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;•The impact of being self-insured for certain costs;•The transportation infrastructure continues to be a target for terrorist activities; •Failure to successfully implement its business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences.•Any inability to execute and effectively operate, integrate, leverage and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances;•FedEx's ability to manage capital and its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes;•Intense competition; •Its autonomous delivery strategy is dependent upon the ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational and regulatory risks. •The failure to successfully implement its business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences;•Failure to attract and maintain employee talent or maintain company culture, as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation cost;•Labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so.•FedEx Ground relies on service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and the status of these service providers as direct employers of drivers providing these services is being challenged.•Disruptions, modifications in service or changes in the business or financial soundness of the United States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx;•The impact of proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations;•Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits;•The impact of global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change;•Potentially being unable to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for its global operations by calendar 2040;•Any inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography;•Evolving Government regulation and enforcement;•Any adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to its tax positions;•Complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection; •The regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights;•Other risks and uncertainties, including:▪widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis;▪the increasing costs of compliance with federal, state and foreign governmental agency mandates (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act) and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other actions by such agencies;▪changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Japanese yen and Brazilian real, which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency sales prices;▪any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action, derivative and other litigation, such as wage-and-hour, joint employment, securities and discrimination and retaliation claims, and any other legal or governmental proceedings;▪the impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services, and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary information-technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization;▪governmental underinvestment in transportation infrastructure, which could increase our costs and adversely impact our service levels due to traffic congestion, prolonged closure of key thoroughfares or sub-optimal routing of our vehicles and aircraft;▪disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs;▪stockholder activism, which could divert the attention of management and our board of directors from our business, hinder execution of our business strategy, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future and cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly; and,▪constraints, volatility or disruption in the capital markets, our ability to maintain our current credit ratings, commercial paper ratings, and senior unsecured debt and pass-through certificate credit ratings, and our ability to meet credit agreement financial covenants.A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly and FedEx may reduce the number of aircraft we lease and operate upon 10 days’ written notice.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction in any period could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period. 12Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions.Our ground equipment sales segment’s deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units.We are affected by the risks faced by commercial aircraft operators and MRO companies because they are our customers.Commercial aircraft operators are engaged in economically sensitive, highly cyclical and competitive businesses. We are a supplier to commercial aircraft operators and MROs. As a result, we are indirectly affected by all of the risks facing commercial aircraft operators and MROs, with such risks being largely beyond our control. Our results of operations depend, in part, on the financial strength of our customers and our customers’ ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and manage their risks. Our engine values and lease rates, which are dependent on the status of the types of aircraft on which engines are installed, and other factors, could decline.The value of a particular model of engine depends heavily on the types of aircraft on which it may be installed and the available supply of such engines. Values of engines generally tend to be relatively stable so long as there is sufficient demand for the host aircraft. However, the value of an engine may begin to decline rapidly once the host aircraft begins to be retired from service and/or used for spare parts in significant numbers. Certain types of engines may be used in significant numbers by commercial aircraft operators that are currently experiencing financial difficulties. If such operators were to go into liquidation or similar proceedings, the resulting over-supply of engines from these operators could have an adverse effect on the demand for the affected engine types and the values of such engines.Upon termination of a lease, we may be unable to enter into new leases or sell the airframe, engine or its parts on acceptable terms.We directly or indirectly own the engines or aircraft that we lease to customers and bear the risk of not recovering our entire investment through leasing and selling the engines or aircraft. Upon termination of a lease, we seek to enter a new lease or to sell or part-out the engine or aircraft. We also selectively sell engines on an opportunistic basis. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to find, in a timely manner, a lessee or a buyer for our engines or aircraft coming off-lease or for their associated parts. If we do find a lessee, we may not be able to obtain satisfactory lease rates and terms (including maintenance and redelivery conditions), and we cannot guarantee that the creditworthiness of any future lessee will be equal to or better than that of the existing lessees of our engines. Because the terms of engine leases may be less than 12 months, we may frequently need to remarket engines. We face the risk that we may not be able to keep our engines on lease consistently.Failures by lessees to meet their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations under our leases could adversely affect the value of our leased engines and aircraft which could affect our ability to re-lease the engines and aircraft in a timely manner following termination of the leases.The value and income producing potential of an engine or aircraft depends heavily on it being maintained in accordance with an approved maintenance system and complying with all applicable governmental directives and manufacturer requirements. In addition, for an engine or aircraft to be available for service, all records, logs, licenses and documentation relating to maintenance and operations of the engine or aircraft must be maintained in accordance with governmental and manufacturer specifications.  Under our leases, our lessees are primarily responsible for maintaining our aircraft and engines and complying with all governmental requirements applicable to the lessee and the aircraft and engines, including operational, maintenance, government agency oversight, registration requirements and airworthiness directives. However, over time, certain lessees have experienced, and may experience in the future, difficulties in meeting their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations as specified by the terms of our leases.  Failure by our lessees to maintain our assets in accordance with requirements could negatively affect the value and desirability of our assets and expose us to increased maintenance costs that may not be sufficiently covered by supplemental maintenance rents paid by such lessees.Our ability to determine the condition of the engines or aircraft and whether the lessees are properly maintaining our assets is generally limited to the lessees’ reporting of monthly usage and any maintenance performed, confirmed by periodic inspections performed by us and third-parties. A lessee’s failure to meet its maintenance or recordkeeping obligations under a lease could result in:a.a grounding of the related engine or aircraft;b.a repossession that would likely cause us to incur additional and potentially substantial expenditures in restoring the engine or aircraft to an acceptable maintenance condition;c.a need to incur additional costs and devote resources to recreate the records prior to the sale or lease of the engine or aircraft;d.a decline in the market value of the aircraft or engine resulting in lower revenues upon a subsequent lease or sale; e.loss of lease revenue while we perform refurbishments or repairs and recreate records; andf.a lower lease rate and/or shorter lease term under a new lease entered into by us following repossession of the engine or aircraft.Any of these events may adversely affect the value of the engine, unless and until remedied, and reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. If an engine is damaged during a lease and we are unable to recover from the lessee or though insurance, we may incur a loss.13We may experience losses and delays in connection with repossession of engines or aircraft when a lessee defaults.We may not be able to repossess an engine or aircraft when the lessee defaults, and even if we are able to repossess the engine or aircraft, we may have to expend significant funds in the repossession, remarketing and leasing of the asset. When a lessee defaults and such default is not cured in a timely manner, we typically seek to terminate the lease and repossess the engine or aircraft. If a defaulting lessee contests the termination and repossession or is under court protection, enforcement of our rights under the lease may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. We may not realize any practical benefits from our legal rights and we may need to obtain consents to export the engine or aircraft. As a result, the relevant asset may be off-lease or not producing revenue for a prolonged period of time. In addition, we will incur direct costs associated with repossessing our engine or aircraft, including, but not limited to, legal and similar costs, the direct costs of transporting, storing and insuring the engine or aircraft, and costs associated with necessary maintenance and recordkeeping to make the asset available for lease or sale. During this time, we will realize no revenue from the leased engine or aircraft, and we will continue to be obligated to pay any debt financing associated with the asset. If an engine is installed on an airframe, the airframe may be owned by an aircraft lessor or other third party. Our ability to recover engines installed on airframes may depend on the cooperation of the airframe owner.Our commercial jet engine and parts segment and its customers operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell our engines or aircraft.Certain of the laws and regulations applicable to our business, include:Licenses and consents.  A number of our leases require specific governmental or regulatory licenses, consents or approvals. These include consents for certain payments under the leases and for the export, import or re-export of our engines or aircraft. Consents needed in connection with future leasing or sale of our engines or aircraft may not be received timely or have economically feasible terms. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to lease or sell engines or aircraft.Export/import regulations.  The U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Commerce Department”) regulates exports. We are subject to the Commerce Department’s and the U.S. Department of State’s regulations with respect to the lease and sale of engines and aircraft to foreign entities and the export of related parts. These Departments may, in some cases, require us to obtain export licenses for engines exported to foreign countries. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, enforces regulations related to the import of engines and aircraft into the United States for maintenance or lease and imports of parts for installation on our engines and aircraft.Restriction Lists.  We are prohibited from doing business with persons designated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) on its “Specially Designated Nationals List,” and must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with OFAC’s rules. Similarly, sanctions issued by the United Nations, the U.S. government, the European Union or other foreign governments could prohibit or restrict us from doing business in certain countries or with certain persons. As a result, we must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with such sanctions.Anti-corruption Laws. As a U.S. corporation with international operations, we are required to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations which combat corruption. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any official act or decision or securing any improper advantage. The scope and enforcement of such anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. Although our policies expressly mandate compliance with the FCPA and similarly applicable laws, there can be no assurance that none of our employees or agents will take any action in violation of our policies. Violations of such laws or regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties. Actual or alleged violations could also damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business.Civil aviation regulation. Users of engines and aircraft are subject to general civil aviation authorities, including the FAA and the EASA, who regulate the maintenance of engines and issue airworthiness directives. Airworthiness directives typically set forth special maintenance actions or modifications to certain engine and aircraft types or a series of specific engines that must be implemented for the engine or aircraft to remain in service. Also, airworthiness directives may require the lessee to make more frequent inspections of an engine, aircraft or particular engine parts. Each lessee of an engine or aircraft generally is responsible for complying with all airworthiness directives. However, if the engine or aircraft is off lease, we may be forced to bear the cost of compliance with such airworthiness directives. Additionally, even if the engine or aircraft is leased, subject to the terms of the lease, if any, we may still be forced to share the cost of compliance.Our aircraft, engines and parts could cause damage resulting in liability claims.  Our aircraft, engines or parts could cause bodily injury or property damage, exposing us to liability claims. Our leases require our lessees to indemnify us against these claims and to carry insurance customary in the air transportation industry, including general liability and property insurance at agreed upon levels. However, we cannot guarantee that one or more catastrophic events will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that lessees’ insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Any insurance coverage deficiency or default by lessees under their indemnification or insurance obligations may reduce our recovery of losses upon an event of loss.We have risks in managing our portfolio of aircraft and engines to meet customer needs.14The relatively long life cycles of aircraft and jet engines can be shortened by world events, government regulation or customer preferences. We seek to manage these risks by trying to anticipate demand for particular engine and aircraft types, maintaining a portfolio mix of engines that we believe is diversified, has long-term value and will be sought by lessees in the global market for jet engines, and by selling engines and aircraft that we expect will not experience obsolescence or declining usefulness in the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that the engine and aircraft types owned or acquired by us will meet customer demand.Liens on our engines or aircraft could exceed the value of such assets, which could negatively affect our ability to repossess, lease or sell a particular engine or aircraft.Liens that secure the payment of repairers’ charges or other liens may, depending on the jurisdiction, attach to engines and aircraft. Engines also may be installed on airframes to which liens unrelated to the engines have attached. These liens may secure substantial sums that may, in certain jurisdictions or for certain types of liens, exceed the value of the particular engine or aircraft to which the liens have attached. In some jurisdictions, a lien may give the holder the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the engine or aircraft. Such liens may have priority over our interest as well as our creditors’ interest in the engines or aircraft. These liens and lien holders could impair our ability to repossess and lease or sell the engines or aircraft. We cannot give assurance that our lessees will comply with their obligations to discharge third-party liens on our assets. If they do not, we may, in the future, find it necessary to pay the claims secured by such liens to repossess such assets.In certain countries, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an addition to the aircraft and we may not be able to exercise our ownership rights over the engine. In certain jurisdictions, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an addition to the aircraft such that the ownership rights of the owner of the aircraft supersede the ownership rights of the owner of the engine. If an aircraft is security for the owner’s obligations to a third-party, the security interest in the aircraft may supersede our rights as owner of the engine. Such a security interest could limit our ability to repossess an engine located in such a jurisdiction in the event of a lessee bankruptcy or lease default. We may suffer a loss if we are not able to repossess engines leased to lessees in these jurisdictions.Higher or volatile fuel prices could affect the profitability of the aviation industry and our lessees’ ability to meet their lease payment obligations to us. Historically, fuel prices have fluctuated widely depending primarily on international market conditions, geopolitical and environmental factors and events and currency exchange rates. Natural and other disasters can also significantly affect fuel availability and prices. The cost of fuel represents a major expense to airlines that is not within their control, and significant increases in fuel costs or hedges that inaccurately assess the direction of fuel costs can materially and adversely affect their operating results. Due to the competitive nature of the aviation industry, operators may be unable to pass on increases in fuel prices to their customers by increasing fares in a manner that fully offsets the increased fuel costs they may incur. In addition, they may not be able to manage this risk by appropriately hedging their exposure to fuel price fluctuations. The profitability and liquidity of those airlines that do hedge their fuel costs can also be adversely affected by swift movements in fuel prices if such airlines are required to post cash collateral under hedge agreements. Therefore, if for any reason fuel prices return to historically high levels or show significant volatility, our lessees are likely to incur higher costs or generate lower revenues, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.Interruptions in the capital markets could impair our lessees’ ability to finance their operations, which could prevent the lessees from complying with payment obligations to us. The global financial markets can be highly volatile and the availability of credit from financial markets and financial institutions can vary substantially depending on developments in the global financial markets. Our lessees depend on banks and the capital markets to provide working capital and to refinance existing indebtedness. To the extent such funding is unavailable, or available only on unfavorable terms, and to the extent financial markets do not provide equity financing as an alternative, our lessees’ operations and operating results may be materially and adversely affected and they may not comply with their respective payment obligations to us.Our lessees may fail to adequately insure our aircraft or engines which could subject us to additional costs. While an aircraft or engine is on lease, we do not directly control its operation. Nevertheless, because we hold title to the aircraft or engine, we could, in certain jurisdictions, be held liable for losses resulting from its operation. At a minimum, we may be required to expend resources in our defense. We require our lessees to obtain specified levels of insurance and indemnify us for, and insure against, such operational liabilities. However, some lessees may fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage during a lease term, which, although constituting a breach of the lease, would require us to take some corrective action, such as terminating the lease or securing insurance for the aircraft or engines. Therefore, our lessees’ insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims that could be asserted against us arising from the operation of our aircraft or engines. Inadequate insurance coverage or default by lessees in fulfilling their indemnification or insurance obligations to us will reduce the insurance proceeds that we would otherwise be entitled to receive in the event we are sued and are required to make payments to claimants. Moreover, our lessees’ insurance coverage is dependent on the financial condition of insurance companies and their ability to pay claims. A reduction in insurance proceeds otherwise payable to us as a result of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results.If our lessees fail to cooperate in returning our aircraft or engines following lease terminations, we may encounter obstacles and are likely to incur significant costs and expenses conducting repossessions. 15Our legal rights and the relative difficulty of repossession vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction in which an aircraft or engines are located. We may need to obtain a court order or consents for de-registration or re-export, a process that can differ substantially from county to country. When a defaulting lessee is in bankruptcy, protective administration, insolvency or similar proceedings, additional limitations may also apply. For example, certain jurisdictions give rights to the trustee in bankruptcy or a similar officer to assume or reject the lease, to assign it to a third party, or to entitle the lessee or another third party to retain possession of the aircraft or engines without paying lease rentals or performing all or some of the obligations under the relevant lease. Certain of our lessees are partially or wholly owned by government-related entities, which can further complicate our efforts to repossess our aircraft or engines in that government’s jurisdiction. If we encounter any of these difficulties, we may be delayed in, or prevented from, enforcing certain of our rights under a lease and in re-leasing the affected aircraft or engines.When conducting a repossession, we are likely to incur significant costs and expenses that are unlikely to be recouped. These include legal and other expenses related to legal proceedings, including the cost of posting security bonds or letters of credit necessary to effect repossession of the aircraft or engines, particularly if the lessee is contesting the proceedings or is in bankruptcy. We must absorb the cost of lost revenue for the time the aircraft or engines are off-lease. We may incur substantial maintenance, refurbishment or repair costs that a defaulting lessee has failed to pay and are necessary to put the aircraft or engines in suitable condition for re-lease or sale. We may also incur significant costs in retrieving or recreating aircraft records required for registration of the aircraft and in obtaining the certificate of airworthiness for an aircraft. It may be necessary to pay to discharge liens or pay taxes and other governmental charges on the aircraft to obtain clear possession and to remarket the aircraft effectively, including, in some cases, liens that the lessee may have incurred in connection with the operation of its other aircraft. We may also incur other costs in connection with the physical possession of the aircraft or engines.If our lessees fail to discharge aircraft liens for which they are responsible, we may be obligated to pay to discharge the liens. In the normal course of their businesses, our lessees are likely to incur aircraft and engine liens that secure the payment of airport fees and taxes, custom duties, Eurocontrol and other air navigation charges, landing charges, crew wages, and other liens that may attach to our aircraft. Aircraft may also be subject to mechanic’s liens as a result of routine maintenance performed by third parties on behalf of our customers. Some of these liens can secure substantial sums, and if they attach to entire fleets of aircraft, as permitted for certain kinds of liens, they may exceed the value of the aircraft itself. Although the financial obligations relating to these liens are the contractual responsibility of our lessees, if they fail to fulfill their obligations, the liens may ultimately become our financial responsibility. Until they are discharged, these liens could impair our ability to repossess, re-lease or sell our aircraft or engines. In some jurisdictions, aircraft and engine liens may give the holder thereof the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the aircraft. If we are obliged to pay a large amount to discharge a lien, or if we are unable take possession of our aircraft subject to a lien in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could materially and adversely affect our financial results.If our lessees encounter financial difficulties and we restructure or terminate our leases, we are likely to obtain less favorable lease terms. If a lessee delays, reduces, or fails to make rental payments when due, or has advised us that it will do so in the future, we may elect or be required to restructure or terminate the lease. A restructured lease will likely contain terms that are less favorable to us. If we are unable to agree on a restructuring and we terminate the lease, we may not receive all or any payments still outstanding, and we may be unable to re-lease the aircraft or engines promptly and at favorable rates, if at all.Withdrawal, suspension or revocation of governmental authorizations or approvals could negatively affect our business.We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business. Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and operation of aircraft operated in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, such as the EASA in Europe, regulate aircraft operated in those countries. With the aircraft, engines and related parts that we purchase, lease and sell to our customers, we include documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. With respect to a particular engine or engine component, we utilize FAA and/or EASA certified repair stations to repair and certify engines and components to ensure marketability. The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New and more stringent government regulations, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries require approval or licensing from the U.S. government. Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Our Structure and Financing/Liquidity RisksOur holding company structure may increase risks related to our operations.Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon those of our individual businesses, and our aggregate investment in particular industries. We are a holding company with investments in businesses and assets in a number of industries. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon our various businesses and investments and their management teams. Each of our businesses generally operate independently and in a decentralized manner.  Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we guarantee the obligations of entities that we manage and/or invest 16in.  Any material adverse change in one of our businesses, investments or management teams, or in a particular industry in which we operate or invest, may cause material adverse changes to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The more capital we devote to a particular investment or industry may increase the risk that such investment could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations, possibly in a material adverse way.A small number of stockholders has the ability to control the Company.We have a very concentrated stockholder base. As of March 31, 2023, our three largest stockholders beneficially owned or had the ability to direct the voting of shares of our common stock representing approximately 65% of the outstanding shares. As a result, these stockholders have the power to determine the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our board of directors. In addition, future sales by these stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the potential for such sales, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our securities.Although we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption, we may soon become a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards, and we would qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. A “controlled company,” as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards, is a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company. Controlled companies are not required to comply with certain Nasdaq listing standards relating to corporate governance, including:•the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;•the requirement that its nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and•the requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.As of May 4, 2023, Nicolas Swenson, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,340,799 shares of our common stock, which represents 47.84% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock.  Our President, CEO/Chairman could soon own a majority of the voting power for the election of our directors, and thus we would meet the definition of a “controlled company.” As a result, these requirements would not apply to us as long as we remain a “controlled company.”Although we may soon qualify as a “controlled company,” we currently do not, and we do not expect to, rely on this exemption and we currently comply with, and we expect to continue to comply with, all relevant corporate governance requirements under the Nasdaq listing standards. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq listing standards that relate to corporate governance.An increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our cash flow and negatively affect the results of our business operations.A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. In addition, if we refinance our indebtedness or it matures and interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced or matures, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could limit our operational flexibility and also impact our ability to make payments on our obligations as they come due.In addition to being capital intensive and highly leveraged, our aircraft and engine business requires that we maintain sufficient liquidity to enable us to contribute the non-financed portion of engine and aircraft purchases as well as to service our payment obligations to our creditors as they become due, despite the fact that the timing and amounts of our revenues do not match the timing under our debt service obligations. Our restricted cash is unavailable for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and maintain our operations depends on our ability to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity, cash and available credit under our credit facilities. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are subjected to one or more of the following:•a significant decline in revenues,•a material increase in interest expense that is not matched by a corresponding increase in revenues,•a significant increase in operating expenses,  •a reduction in our available credit under our credit facilities, or•general economic or national events. If we do not maintain sufficient liquidity, our ability to meet our payment obligations to creditors or to borrow additional funds could become impaired.Future cash flows from operations or through financings may not be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its obligations.17Future cash flow of the Company’s operations can fluctuate significantly.  If future cash flows are not sufficient to permit the Company to meet its obligations, this would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company, its businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt. There can be no assurance that the Company or its subsidiaries will continue to have access to their lines of credit if their financial performance does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in the applicable financing agreements. If the Company or its subsidiaries do not meet certain of its financial covenants, and if they are unable to secure necessary waivers or other amendments from the respective lenders on terms acceptable to management and to renew or replace financing arrangements that mature during the current fiscal year, their ability to access available lines of credit could be limited, their debt obligations could be accelerated by the respective lenders and liquidity could be adversely affected.The Company and/or its subsidiaries may be required to seek additional or alternative financing sources if the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ cash needs are significantly greater than anticipated or they do not materially meet their business plans, or there are unanticipated downturns in the markets for the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ products and services. Future disruption and volatility in credit market conditions could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability, or that of its subsidiaries, to refinance debt when it comes due on terms similar to our current credit facilities, to draw upon existing lines of credit or to incur additional debt if needed. There can be no assurance therefore that such financing will be available or available on acceptable terms. The inability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or through financings or disruptions in the credit markets could impair the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ liquidity and would likely have a material adverse effect on their businesses, financial condition and results of operations.A large proportion of our capital is invested in physical assets and securities that can be hard to sell, especially if market conditions are poor. Because our investment strategy can involve public company securities, we may be restricted in our ability to effect sales during certain time periods. A lack of liquidity could limit our ability to vary our portfolio or assets promptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. Additionally, if financial or operating difficulties of other competitors result in distress sales, such sales could depress asset values in the markets in which we operate. The restrictions inherent in owning physical assets could reduce our ability to respond to changes in market conditions and could adversely affect the performance of our investments, our financial condition and results of operations. Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of illiquid or non-public investments, the fair values of such investments do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained when such investments are realized. To service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available. Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, will depend largely upon our future operating performance. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on our maintaining specified financial ratios and satisfying financial condition tests and other covenants in the agreements governing our debt. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available in amounts sufficient to pay our debt and to satisfy our other liquidity needs.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to seek alternatives.If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and aircraft or engine purchases, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and might require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or to meet our aircraft or engine purchase commitments as they come due.The transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our cost to obtain financing and may potentially negatively impact our interest rate swap agreements.It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR"") to alternative rates  may have a material adverse impact on the availability and cost of our financing, including LIBOR-based loans, as well as our interest rate swap agreements. We currently anticipate phasing out of our LIBOR based loans and swaps in the foreseeable future but uncertainty remains with respect to the implementation of the phase out and what revisions will be required and implemented, which will depend heavily on the current market conditions.  It therefore remains uncertain how such changes will be implemented and the effects such changes would have on us and the financial markets generally. These changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing and on our financing costs. Also, increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense and the cost of refinancing existing debt and incurring new debt, unless we make arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates, which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to equity holders.Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may incur significantly more debt, and cash may not be available to meet our financial obligations when due or enable us to capitalize on investment opportunities when they arise. 18We employ debt and other forms of leverage in the ordinary course of business to enhance returns to our investors and finance our operations, and despite our current indebtedness levels, we expect to incur additional debt in the future to finance our operations, including purchasing aircraft and engines and meeting our contractual obligations as the agreements relating to our debt, including our junior subordinated debentures, indentures, term loan facilities, revolving credit facilities, and other financings do not entirely prohibit us from incurring additional debt. We also enter into financing commitments in the normal course of business, which we may be required to fund. If we are required to fund these commitments and are unable to do so, we could be liable for damages pursued against us or a loss of opportunity through default under contracts that are otherwise to our benefit could occur.  We are therefore subject to the risks associated with debt financing and refinancing, including but not limited to the following: (i) our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; (ii) payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pay operating expenses and dividends; (iii) if we are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at high interest rates or on other unfavorable terms, we may have difficulty completing acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case; (iv) we may not be able to refinance indebtedness at maturity due to company and market factors such as the estimated cash flow produced by our assets, the value of our assets, liquidity in the debt markets, and/or financial, competitive, business and other factors; and (v) if we are able to refinance our indebtedness, the terms of a refinancing may not be as favorable as the original terms for such indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we may need to utilize available liquidity, which would reduce our ability to pursue new investment opportunities, dispose of one or more of our assets on disadvantageous terms, or raise equity, causing dilution to existing stockholders.The terms of our various credit agreements and other financing documents also require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios, and adequate insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in conducting our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, even if we have satisfied and continue to satisfy our payment obligations. Regulatory and market changes may also result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to credit.Our current financing arrangements require compliance with financial and other covenants and a failure to comply with such covenants could adversely affect our ability to operate.The terms of our various credit agreements and other financing documents require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and adequate insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in conducting our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, even if we have satisfied and continue to satisfy our payment obligations. Regulatory and market changes may also result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to credit.Future acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and investments are possible, changing the components of our assets and liabilities, and if unsuccessful or unfavorable, could reduce the value of the Company and its securities.Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities, as well as our business mix and prospects. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time.We face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business.We expect the growth and development of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions, investments, and strategic partnering. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that financial controls, the level and knowledge of personnel, operational abilities, legal and compliance controls and other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, if we acquire new businesses and/or introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties concerning the integration of their controls and systems, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls, other operations and adequate security. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.Our business strategy includes acquisitions, and acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the risk of management diversion and increased costs and expenses, all of which could negatively affect the Company’s ability to operate profitably.Our business strategy includes, among other things, strategic and opportunistic acquisitions. This element of our strategy entails several risks, including, but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the need to finance such acquisitions with additional equity and/or debt. In addition, once completed, acquisitions entail further risks, including: unanticipated costs and liabilities of the acquired businesses, including environmental liabilities, that could materially adversely affect our results of operations; difficulties in assimilating acquired businesses, preventing the expected benefits from the transaction from being realized or achieved within the anticipated time frame; negative effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and losing key employees of the acquired businesses. If our acquisition strategy is not successful or if acquisitions are not well integrated into our existing operations, the Company’s operations and business results could be negatively affected.Strategic ventures may increase risks applicable to our operations.19We may enter into strategic ventures that pose risks, including a lack of complete control over the enterprise, and other potential unforeseen risks, any of which could adversely impact our financial results. We may occasionally enter into strategic ventures or investments with third parties in order to take advantage of favorable financing opportunities, to share capital or operating risk, or to earn aircraft management fees. These strategic ventures and investments may subject us to various risks, including those arising from our possessing limited decision-making rights in the enterprise or over the related aircraft. If we were unable to resolve a dispute with a strategic partner in such a venture that retains material managerial veto rights, we might reach an impasse which may lead to operational difficulties in the venture and increases costs or the liquidation of our investment at a time and in a manner that would result in our losing some or all of our original investment and/or the occurrence of other losses, which could adversely impact our financial results.Rapid business expansions or new business initiatives may increase risk.Certain business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses such as the relatively recent expansion at our commercial jet engines and parts segment and the establishment of an aircraft asset management business and an aircraft capital joint venture, may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes, new business plans and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks, and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held. There is no assurance that prior year activity and results will occur in future periods.Our policies and procedures may not be effective in ensuring compliance with applicable law.Our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. We could become subject to various governmental investigations, audits and inquiries, both formal and informal. Such investigations, regardless of their outcome, could be costly, divert management attention, and damage our reputation. The unfavorable resolution of such investigations could result in criminal liability, fines, penalties or other monetary or non-monetary sanctions and could materially affect our business or results of operations.Compliance with the regulatory requirements imposed on us as a public company results in significant costs that may have an adverse effect on our results.As a public company, we are subject to various regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, compliance with the rulesand regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Compliance with these rules and regulations results in significant additional costs to us both directly, through increased audit and consulting fees, and indirectly, through the time required by our limited resources to address such regulations.Deficiencies in our public company financial reporting and disclosures could adversely impact our reputation. As we expand the size and scope of our business, there is a greater susceptibility that our financial reporting and other public disclosure documents may contain material misstatements and that the controls we maintain to attempt to ensure the complete accuracy of our public disclosures may fail to operate as intended. The occurrence of such events could adversely impact our reputation and financial condition. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to give our stakeholders assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). However, the process for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial disclosures on a timely basis, or at all. Some of these processes may be new for certain subsidiaries in our structure, and in the case of acquisitions, may take time to be fully implemented. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under U.S. securities laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. Our policies and procedures governing disclosures may not ensure that all material information regarding us is disclosed in a proper and timely fashion or that we will be successful in preventing the disclosure of material information to a single person or a limited group of people before such information is generally disseminated.Risks Related to Environmental, Social, and Governance IssuesClimate change, related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, and the transition to a lower carbon economy may adversely affect our business.There is increasing concern that a gradual rise in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, an increase in the frequency, severity, and duration of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and water scarcity and poor water quality. These events could also compound adverse economic conditions. To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our businesses are located or operate, we may experience extreme weather and/or changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to, or a decrease in demand for, our properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions and could negatively impact our operations. In addition, changes in federal, state, and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change, including regulations aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of “green” building codes, could result in increased capital expenditures without a corresponding increase in revenue. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations, or 20industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change.We are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather (the frequency and severity of which may be impacted by climate change), which may include more frequent or severe storms, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, hurricanes, flooding, rising sea levels, shortages of water, droughts and wildfires, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Natural disasters, severe weather such as earthquakes, tornadoes, wind, or floods, and wildfires may result in significant damage to our properties or disruption of our operations. The extent of casualty losses and loss of income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area. Additional consequences of severe weather could include increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage.Environmentally hazardous conditions could potentially adversely affect us.Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on such property. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by applicable environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, natural resources, or property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances on one of our properties, or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property, could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated. A property owner who violates environmental laws may be subject to sanctions which may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, private parties. The cost of defending against environmental claims, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, or of remediating any contaminated property could materially and adversely affect us.We are subject to increasing scrutiny from investors and others regarding our environmental, social, governance, or sustainability responsibilities, which could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation, associate retention, and ability to raise capital from such investors.Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, and stakeholders have focused increasingly on the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG” or “sustainability”) practices of companies, including those associated with climate change. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation and associate retention may be negatively impacted based on an assessment of our ESG practices. Any sustainability disclosures we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, associate health and safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. In addition, investors may decide to refrain from investing in us as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of the ESG factors"

.General Business Risks8Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health issues, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic.Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected if the COVID-19 pandemic, or another global health crisis, impacts our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others’ ability to conduct business or negatively affects consumer and business confidence or the global economy. The COVID-19 health crisis has affected large segments of the global economy, including the markets we operate in, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, and created significant disruption of the financial markets. Economic uncertainty as a result of any global health crisis could negatively affect our business, suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, including as a result of business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, reduced operations, restrictions on shipping, fabricating or installing products, reduced consumer demand or customers’ ability to make payments. We have and may continue to experience additional operating costs due to increased challenges with our workforce (including as a result of illness, absenteeism or government orders), implementing further precautionary measures to protect the health of our workforce, orders put on hold or reduced access to supplies, capital, and fundamental support services (such as shipping and transportation). Furthermore, we do operate and compete globally and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by domestic and foreign governments has been and may continue to be varied and those differences may impact our competitiveness. Any resulting financial impact cannot be fully estimated at this time, but may materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or any global health situation will depend largely on future developments which are highly uncertain and we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Even while government restrictions and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have lessened, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting supply chain disruptions, economic recession or depression. Furthermore, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown. Our management team has, and will likely continue to, spend significant time, attention and resources monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to manage its effects on our business and workforce.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this section, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. This pandemic is still ongoing and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.Market fluctuations may affect our operations.Market fluctuations may affect our ability to obtain necessary funds for the operation of our businesses from current lenders or new borrowings. In addition, we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. Third-party reports relating to market studies or demographics we obtained previously may no longer be accurate or complete. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events or any other related matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and the overall value of our assets.Rising inflation may result in increased costs of operations and negatively impact the credit and securities markets generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.Inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally due in part to global supply chain issues, the Ukraine-Russia war, a rise in energy prices, and strong consumer demand as economies continue to reopen from restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. An inflationary environment can increase our cost of labor, as well as our other operating costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, economic conditions could impact and reduce the number of customers who purchase our products or services as credit becomes more expensive or unavailable. Although interest rates have increased and are expected to increase further, inflation may continue. Further, increased interest rates could have a negative effect on the securities markets generally which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.We could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses.We compete with many other organizations for skilled management and staff employees, including organizations that operate in different market sectors than us. Costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations.Legacy technology systems require a unique technical skillset which is becoming scarcer.The Company deploys legacy technology systems in several significant business units. As technology continues to rapidly change, the available pool of individuals technically trained in and able to repair or perform maintenance on these legacy systems shrinks. As this scarcity increases, the Company’s ability to efficiently and quickly repair its legacy systems becomes increasingly difficult, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s day-to-day operations.9Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business. We store sensitive data and proprietary information on these systems. Threats to these systems, and the laws and regulations governing security of data, including personal data, on information systems and otherwise held by companies is evolving and adding layers of complexity in the form of new requirements and increasing costs of attempting to protect information systems and data and complying with new cybersecurity regulations. Information systems are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our information systems, computer technology, and business. Global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information systems and computer technology to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats and ransomware. The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions, ransom payments, and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations. Further, our technology resources may be strained due to an increase in the number of remote users. In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We sustained a cybersecurity attack in May 2022 involving ransomware that caused a network disruption and impacted certain of our systems. Upon detection, we undertook steps to address the incident, including engaging a team of third-party forensic experts and notifying law enforcement. We restored network systems and resumed normal operations. We are continuing to assess all actions that we will take to improve our existing systems. While we do not believe this event or resultant actions will have a material adverse effect on our business, this or similar incidents, or any other such breach of our data security infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Although we maintain cybersecurity liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify us for any liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability or litigation costs that are not covered by insurance could harm our business.We may not be able to insure certain risks adequately or economically.We cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur, or if we are required to pay a deductible for an insured loss, results of operations could be adversely affected.Legal liability may harm our business.Many aspects of our businesses involve substantial risks of liability, and, in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our businesses, including expansions into new products or markets, impose greater risks of liability. In addition, unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our businesses and our prospects. Although our current assessment is that there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact, if our assessment proves to be in error, then the outcome of such litigation could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Our business might suffer if we were to lose the services of certain key employees.Our business operations depend upon our key employees, including our executive officers. Loss of any of these employees, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses as our key employees have knowledge of our industry and customers that would be difficult to replace.Risks Related to Our Segment OperationsThe operating results of our four segments may fluctuate, particularly our commercial jet engine and parts segment.The operating results of our four segments have varied from period to period and comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful. Due to a number of factors, including the risks described in this section, our operating results may fluctuate. These fluctuations may also be caused by, among other things:a.the economic health of the economy and the aviation industry in general;b.FedEx’s demand for the use of the services of our Air Cargo segment; c.the timing and number of purchases and sales of engines or aircraft;10d.the timing and amount of maintenance reserve revenues recorded resulting from the termination of long term leases, for which significant amounts of maintenance reserves may have accumulated;e.the termination or announced termination of production of particular aircraft and engine types;f.the retirement or announced retirement of particular aircraft models by aircraft operators;g.the operating history of any particular engine, aircraft or engine or aircraft model;h.the length of our operating leases; andi.the timing of necessary overhauls of engines and aircraft.These risks may reduce our operating segment’s results including particularly our commercial jet engines and parts segment.  These risks may reduce the commercial jet engines and parts segment’s engine utilization rates, lease margins, maintenance reserve revenues and proceeds from engine sales, and result in higher legal, technical, maintenance, storage and insurance costs related to repossession and the cost of engines being off-lease. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the availability of engines for lease or sale periodically experiences cycles of oversupply and undersupply of given engine models and generally. The incidence of an oversupply of engines may produce substantial decreases in engine lease rates and the appraised and resale value of engines and may increase the time and costs incurred to lease or sell engines. We anticipate that supply fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. As a result, comparisons to results from preceding periods may not be meaningful and results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.Our Air Cargo Segment is dependent on a significant customer.Our Air Cargo business is significantly dependent on a contractual relationship with FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”), the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, 41% of our consolidated operating revenues, and 97% of the operating revenues for our overnight air cargo segment, arose from services we provided to FedEx. While FedEx has been our customer since 1980 under similar terms, our current agreements may be terminated by FedEx upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, FedEx may terminate the dry-lease agreement with MAC or CSA upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes its only customer, or either MAC or CSA employs less than six employees. As of the date of issuance of this report, FedEx would be permitted to terminate each of the dry-lease agreements under this provision. The loss of these contracts with FedEx would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Our dry-lease agreements with FedEx subject us to operating risks.Our dry-lease agreements with FedEx provide for the lease of specified aircraft by us in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased. The dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of our costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Under the dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by us in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are borne solely by us.Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations.Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. These risks are discussed in FedEx’s periodic reports filed with the SEC including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. These risks include but are not limited to the following:•Economic conditions and anti-trade measures/trade policies and relations in the global markets in which it operates;•Additional changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally and adversely affect our business and results of operations.•The price and availability of fuel.•Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand;•Potential disruption to operations resulting from a significant data breach or other disruption to FedEx’s technology infrastructure;•The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;•The impact of being self-insured for certain costs;•The transportation infrastructure continues to be a target for terrorist activities; •Any inability to execute and effectively operate, integrate, leverage and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances;•FedEx's ability to manage capital and its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes;•Intense competition; •Its autonomous delivery strategy is dependent upon the ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational and regulatory risks.•The failure to successfully implement its business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences;•Failure to attract and maintain employee talent or maintain company culture, as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation cost;•Labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so.•FedEx Ground relies on service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and the status of these service providers as direct employers of drivers providing these services is being challenged.11•Disruptions, modifications in service or changes in the business or financial soundness of the United States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx;•The impact of proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations;•Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits;•The impact of global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change;•Potentially being unable to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for its global operations by calendar 2040;•Any inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography;•Evolving Government regulation and enforcement;•Any adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to its tax positions;•Complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection; •The regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights;•Other risks and uncertainties, including:◦widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis;◦the increasing costs of compliance with federal, state and foreign governmental agency mandates (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act) and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other actions by such agencies;◦changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the euro, Chinese yuan, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Mexican peso, Japanese yen and Brazilian real, which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency sales prices;◦any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action, derivative and other litigation, such as wage-and-hour, joint employment, securities and discrimination and retaliation claims, and any other legal or governmental proceedings;◦the impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services, and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary information-technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization;◦governmental underinvestment in transportation infrastructure, which could increase our costs and adversely impact our service levels due to traffic congestion, prolonged closure of key thoroughfares or sub-optimal routing of our vehicles and aircraft;◦disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of FedEx and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs;◦stockholder activism, which could divert the attention of management and our board of directors from our business, hinder execution of our business strategy, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future and cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly;◦constraints, volatility or disruption in the capital markets, our ability to maintain our current credit ratings, commercial paper ratings, and senior unsecured debt and pass-through certificate credit ratings, and our ability to meet credit agreement financial covenants; and◦the alternative interest rates we are able to negotiate with counterparties pursuant to the relevant provisions of our credit agreements following cessation of the publication of the London Interbank Offered Rate in the event the euro interbank offered rate also ceases to exist and we make borrowings under the agreements.A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly and FedEx may reduce the number of aircraft we lease and operate upon 10 days’ written notice.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction in any period could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period. Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions.Our ground equipment sales segment’s deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units.We are affected by the risks faced by commercial aircraft operators and MRO companies because they are our customers.Commercial aircraft operators are engaged in economically sensitive, highly cyclical and competitive businesses. We are a supplier to commercial aircraft operators and MROs. As a result, we are indirectly affected by all of the risks facing commercial aircraft operators and MROs, with such risks being largely beyond our control. Our results of operations depend, in part, on the financial strength of our customers and our customers’ ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and manage their risks. Our engine values and lease rates, which are dependent on the status of the types of aircraft on which engines are installed, and other factors, could decline.12The value of a particular model of engine depends heavily on the types of aircraft on which it may be installed and the available supply of such engines. Values of engines generally tend to be relatively stable so long as there is sufficient demand for the host aircraft. However, the value of an engine may begin to decline rapidly once the host aircraft begins to be retired from service and/or used for spare parts in significant numbers. Certain types of engines may be used in significant numbers by commercial aircraft operators that are currently experiencing financial difficulties. If such operators were to go into liquidation or similar proceedings, the resulting over-supply of engines from these operators could have an adverse effect on the demand for the affected engine types and the values of such engines.Upon termination of a lease, we may be unable to enter into new leases or sell the airframe, engine or its parts on acceptable terms.We directly or indirectly own the engines or aircraft that we lease to customers and bear the risk of not recovering our entire investment through leasing and selling the engines or aircraft. Upon termination of a lease, we seek to enter a new lease or to sell or part-out the engine or aircraft. We also selectively sell engines on an opportunistic basis. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to find, in a timely manner, a lessee or a buyer for our engines or aircraft coming off-lease or for their associated parts. If we do find a lessee, we may not be able to obtain satisfactory lease rates and terms (including maintenance and redelivery conditions), and we cannot guarantee that the creditworthiness of any future lessee will be equal to or better than that of the existing lessees of our engines. Because the terms of engine leases may be less than 12 months, we may frequently need to remarket engines. We face the risk that we may not be able to keep our engines on lease consistently.Failures by lessees to meet their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations under our leases could adversely affect the value of our leased engines and aircraft which could affect our ability to re-lease the engines and aircraft in a timely manner following termination of the leases.The value and income producing potential of an engine or aircraft depends heavily on it being maintained in accordance with an approved maintenance system and complying with all applicable governmental directives and manufacturer requirements. In addition, for an engine or aircraft to be available for service, all records, logs, licenses and documentation relating to maintenance and operations of the engine or aircraft must be maintained in accordance with governmental and manufacturer specifications.  Under our leases, our lessees are primarily responsible for maintaining our aircraft and engines and complying with all governmental requirements applicable to the lessee and the aircraft and engines, including operational, maintenance, government agency oversight, registration requirements and airworthiness directives. However, over time, certain lessees have experienced, and may experience in the future, difficulties in meeting their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations as specified by the terms of our leases.  Failure by our lessees to maintain our assets in accordance with requirements could negatively affect the value and desirability of our assets and expose us to increased maintenance costs that may not be sufficiently covered by supplemental maintenance rents paid by such lessees.Our ability to determine the condition of the engines or aircraft and whether the lessees are properly maintaining our assets is generally limited to the lessees’ reporting of monthly usage and any maintenance performed, confirmed by periodic inspections performed by us and third-parties. A lessee’s failure to meet its maintenance or recordkeeping obligations under a lease could result in:a.a grounding of the related engine or aircraft;b.a repossession that would likely cause us to incur additional and potentially substantial expenditures in restoring the engine or aircraft to an acceptable maintenance condition;c.a need to incur additional costs and devote resources to recreate the records prior to the sale or lease of the engine or aircraft;d.a decline in the market value of the aircraft or engine resulting in lower revenues upon a subsequent lease or sale; e.loss of lease revenue while we perform refurbishments or repairs and recreate records; andf.a lower lease rate and/or shorter lease term under a new lease entered into by us following repossession of the engine or aircraft.Any of these events may adversely affect the value of the engine, unless and until remedied, and reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. If an engine is damaged during a lease and we are unable to recover from the lessee or though insurance, we may incur a loss.We may experience losses and delays in connection with repossession of engines or aircraft when a lessee defaults.We may not be able to repossess an engine or aircraft when the lessee defaults, and even if we are able to repossess the engine or aircraft, we may have to expend significant funds in the repossession, remarketing and leasing of the asset. When a lessee defaults and such default is not cured in a timely manner, we typically seek to terminate the lease and repossess the engine or aircraft. If a defaulting lessee contests the termination and repossession or is under court protection, enforcement of our rights under the lease may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. We may not realize any practical benefits from our legal rights and we may need to obtain consents to export the engine or aircraft. As a result, the relevant asset may be off-lease or not producing revenue for a prolonged period of time. In addition, we will incur direct costs associated with repossessing our engine or aircraft, including, but not limited to, legal and similar costs, the direct costs of transporting, storing and insuring the engine or aircraft, and costs associated with necessary maintenance and recordkeeping to make the asset available for lease or sale. During this time, we will realize no revenue from the leased engine or aircraft, and we will continue to be obligated to pay any debt financing associated with the asset. If an engine is installed on an airframe, the airframe may be owned by an aircraft lessor or other third party. Our ability to recover engines installed on airframes may depend on the cooperation of the airframe owner.Our commercial jet engine and parts segment and its customers operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell our engines or aircraft.13Certain of the laws and regulations applicable to our business, include:Licenses and consents.  A number of our leases require specific governmental or regulatory licenses, consents or approvals. These include consents for certain payments under the leases and for the export, import or re-export of our engines or aircraft. Consents needed in connection with future leasing or sale of our engines or aircraft may not be received timely or have economically feasible terms. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to lease or sell engines or aircraft.Export/import regulations.  The U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Commerce Department”) regulates exports. We are subject to the Commerce Department’s and the U.S. Department of State’s regulations with respect to the lease and sale of engines and aircraft to foreign entities and the export of related parts. These Departments may, in some cases, require us to obtain export licenses for engines exported to foreign countries. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, enforces regulations related to the import of engines and aircraft into the United States for maintenance or lease and imports of parts for installation on our engines and aircraft.Restriction Lists.  We are prohibited from doing business with persons designated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) on its “Specially Designated Nationals List,” and must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with OFAC’s rules. Similarly, sanctions issued by the United Nations, the U.S. government, the European Union or other foreign governments could prohibit or restrict us from doing business in certain countries or with certain persons. As a result, we must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with such sanctions.Anti-corruption Laws. As a U.S. corporation with international operations, we are required to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations which combat corruption. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any official act or decision or securing any improper advantage. The scope and enforcement of such anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. Although our policies expressly mandate compliance with the FCPA and similarly applicable laws, there can be no assurance that none of our employees or agents will take any action in violation of our policies. Violations of such laws or regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties. Actual or alleged violations could also damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business.Civil aviation regulation. Users of engines and aircraft are subject to general civil aviation authorities, including the FAA and the EASA, who regulate the maintenance of engines and issue airworthiness directives. Airworthiness directives typically set forth special maintenance actions or modifications to certain engine and aircraft types or a series of specific engines that must be implemented for the engine or aircraft to remain in service. Also, airworthiness directives may require the lessee to make more frequent inspections of an engine, aircraft or particular engine parts. Each lessee of an engine or aircraft generally is responsible for complying with all airworthiness directives. However, if the engine or aircraft is off lease, we may be forced to bear the cost of compliance with such airworthiness directives. Additionally, even if the engine or aircraft is leased, subject to the terms of the lease, if any, we may still be forced to share the cost of compliance.Our aircraft, engines and parts could cause damage resulting in liability claims.  Our aircraft, engines or parts could cause bodily injury or property damage, exposing us to liability claims. Our leases require our lessees to indemnify us against these claims and to carry insurance customary in the air transportation industry, including general liability and property insurance at agreed upon levels. However, we cannot guarantee that one or more catastrophic events will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that lessees’ insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Any insurance coverage deficiency or default by lessees under their indemnification or insurance obligations may reduce our recovery of losses upon an event of loss.We have risks in managing our portfolio of aircraft and engines to meet customer needs.The relatively long life cycles of aircraft and jet engines can be shortened by world events, government regulation or customer preferences. We seek to manage these risks by trying to anticipate demand for particular engine and aircraft types, maintaining a portfolio mix of engines that we believe is diversified, has long-term value and will be sought by lessees in the global market for jet engines, and by selling engines and aircraft that we expect will not experience obsolescence or declining usefulness in the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that the engine and aircraft types owned or acquired by us will meet customer demand.Liens on our engines or aircraft could exceed the value of such assets, which could negatively affect our ability to repossess, lease or sell a particular engine or aircraft.Liens that secure the payment of repairers’ charges or other liens may, depending on the jurisdiction, attach to engines and aircraft. Engines also may be installed on airframes to which liens unrelated to the engines have attached. These liens may secure substantial sums that may, in certain jurisdictions or for certain types of liens, exceed the value of the particular engine or aircraft to which the liens have attached. In some jurisdictions, a lien may give the holder the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the engine or aircraft. Such liens may have priority over our interest as well as our creditors’ interest in the engines or aircraft. These liens and lien holders could impair our ability to repossess and lease or sell the engines or aircraft. We cannot give assurance that our lessees will comply with their obligations to discharge third-party liens on our assets. If they do not, we may, in the future, find it necessary to pay the claims secured by such liens to repossess such assets.In certain countries, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an addition to the aircraft and we may not be able to exercise our ownership rights over the engine. 14In certain jurisdictions, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an addition to the aircraft such that the ownership rights of the owner of the aircraft supersede the ownership rights of the owner of the engine. If an aircraft is security for the owner’s obligations to a third-party, the security interest in the aircraft may supersede our rights as owner of the engine. Such a security interest could limit our ability to repossess an engine located in such a jurisdiction in the event of a lessee bankruptcy or lease default. We may suffer a loss if we are not able to repossess engines leased to lessees in these jurisdictions.Higher or volatile fuel prices could affect the profitability of the aviation industry and our lessees’ ability to meet their lease payment obligations to us. Historically, fuel prices have fluctuated widely depending primarily on international market conditions, geopolitical and environmental factors and events and currency exchange rates. Natural and other disasters can also significantly affect fuel availability and prices. The cost of fuel represents a major expense to airlines that is not within their control, and significant increases in fuel costs or hedges that inaccurately assess the direction of fuel costs can materially and adversely affect their operating results. Due to the competitive nature of the aviation industry, operators may be unable to pass on increases in fuel prices to their customers by increasing fares in a manner that fully offsets the increased fuel costs they may incur. In addition, they may not be able to manage this risk by appropriately hedging their exposure to fuel price fluctuations. The profitability and liquidity of those airlines that do hedge their fuel costs can also be adversely affected by swift movements in fuel prices if such airlines are required to post cash collateral under hedge agreements. Therefore, if for any reason fuel prices return to historically high levels or show significant volatility, our lessees are likely to incur higher costs or generate lower revenues, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.Interruptions in the capital markets could impair our lessees’ ability to finance their operations, which could prevent the lessees from complying with payment obligations to us. The global financial markets can be highly volatile and the availability of credit from financial markets and financial institutions can vary substantially depending on developments in the global financial markets. Our lessees depend on banks and the capital markets to provide working capital and to refinance existing indebtedness. To the extent such funding is unavailable, or available only on unfavorable terms, and to the extent financial markets do not provide equity financing as an alternative, our lessees’ operations and operating results may be materially and adversely affected and they may not comply with their respective payment obligations to us.Our lessees may fail to adequately insure our aircraft or engines which could subject us to additional costs. While an aircraft or engine is on lease, we do not directly control its operation. Nevertheless, because we hold title to the aircraft or engine, we could, in certain jurisdictions, be held liable for losses resulting from its operation. At a minimum, we may be required to expend resources in our defense. We require our lessees to obtain specified levels of insurance and indemnify us for, and insure against, such operational liabilities. However, some lessees may fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage during a lease term, which, although constituting a breach of the lease, would require us to take some corrective action, such as terminating the lease or securing insurance for the aircraft or engines. Therefore, our lessees’ insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims that could be asserted against us arising from the operation of our aircraft or engines. Inadequate insurance coverage or default by lessees in fulfilling their indemnification or insurance obligations to us will reduce the insurance proceeds that we would otherwise be entitled to receive in the event we are sued and are required to make payments to claimants. Moreover, our lessees’ insurance coverage is dependent on the financial condition of insurance companies and their ability to pay claims. A reduction in insurance proceeds otherwise payable to us as a result of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results.If our lessees fail to cooperate in returning our aircraft or engines following lease terminations, we may encounter obstacles and are likely to incur significant costs and expenses conducting repossessions. Our legal rights and the relative difficulty of repossession vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction in which an aircraft or engines are located. We may need to obtain a court order or consents for de-registration or re-export, a process that can differ substantially from county to country. When a defaulting lessee is in bankruptcy, protective administration, insolvency or similar proceedings, additional limitations may also apply. For example, certain jurisdictions give rights to the trustee in bankruptcy or a similar officer to assume or reject the lease, to assign it to a third party, or to entitle the lessee or another third party to retain possession of the aircraft or engines without paying lease rentals or performing all or some of the obligations under the relevant lease. Certain of our lessees are partially or wholly owned by government-related entities, which can further complicate our efforts to repossess our aircraft or engines in that government’s jurisdiction. If we encounter any of these difficulties, we may be delayed in, or prevented from, enforcing certain of our rights under a lease and in re-leasing the affected aircraft or engines.When conducting a repossession, we are likely to incur significant costs and expenses that are unlikely to be recouped. These include legal and other expenses related to legal proceedings, including the cost of posting security bonds or letters of credit necessary to effect repossession of the aircraft or engines, particularly if the lessee is contesting the proceedings or is in bankruptcy. We must absorb the cost of lost revenue for the time the aircraft or engines are off-lease. We may incur substantial maintenance, refurbishment or repair costs that a defaulting lessee has failed to pay and are necessary to put the aircraft or engines in suitable condition for re-lease or sale. We may also incur significant costs in retrieving or recreating aircraft records required for registration of the aircraft and in obtaining the certificate of airworthiness for an aircraft. It may be necessary to pay to discharge liens or pay taxes and other governmental charges on the aircraft to obtain clear possession and to remarket the aircraft effectively, including, in some cases, liens that the lessee may have incurred in connection with the operation of its other aircraft. We may also incur other costs in connection with the physical possession of the aircraft or engines.If our lessees fail to discharge aircraft liens for which they are responsible, we may be obligated to pay to discharge the liens. 15In the normal course of their businesses, our lessees are likely to incur aircraft and engine liens that secure the payment of airport fees and taxes, custom duties, Eurocontrol and other air navigation charges, landing charges, crew wages, and other liens that may attach to our aircraft. Aircraft may also be subject to mechanic’s liens as a result of routine maintenance performed by third parties on behalf of our customers. Some of these liens can secure substantial sums, and if they attach to entire fleets of aircraft, as permitted for certain kinds of liens, they may exceed the value of the aircraft itself. Although the financial obligations relating to these liens are the contractual responsibility of our lessees, if they fail to fulfill their obligations, the liens may ultimately become our financial responsibility. Until they are discharged, these liens could impair our ability to repossess, re-lease or sell our aircraft or engines. In some jurisdictions, aircraft and engine liens may give the holder thereof the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the aircraft. If we are obliged to pay a large amount to discharge a lien, or if we are unable take possession of our aircraft subject to a lien in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could materially and adversely affect our financial results.If our lessees encounter financial difficulties and we restructure or terminate our leases, we are likely to obtain less favorable lease terms. If a lessee delays, reduces, or fails to make rental payments when due, or has advised us that it will do so in the future, we may elect or be required to restructure or terminate the lease. A restructured lease will likely contain terms that are less favorable to us. If we are unable to agree on a restructuring and we terminate the lease, we may not receive all or any payments still outstanding, and we may be unable to re-lease the aircraft or engines promptly and at favorable rates, if at all.Withdrawal, suspension or revocation of governmental authorizations or approvals could negatively affect our business.We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business. Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and operation of aircraft operated in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, such as the EASA in Europe, regulate aircraft operated in those countries. With the aircraft, engines and related parts that we purchase, lease and sell to our customers, we include documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. With respect to a particular engine or engine component, we utilize FAA and/or EASA certified repair stations to repair and certify engines and components to ensure marketability. The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New and more stringent government regulations, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries require approval or licensing from the U.S. government. Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Our Structure and Financing/Liquidity RisksOur holding company structure may increase risks related to our operations.Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon those of our individual businesses, and our aggregate investment in particular industries. We are a holding company with investments in businesses and assets in a number of industries. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon our various businesses and investments and their management teams. Each of our businesses generally operate independently and in a decentralized manner.  Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we guarantee the obligations of entities that we manage and/or invest in.  Any material adverse change in one of our businesses, investments or management teams, or in a particular industry in which we operate or invest, may cause material adverse changes to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The more capital we devote to a particular investment or industry may increase the risk that such investment could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations, possibly in a material adverse way.A small number of stockholders has the ability to control the Company.We have a very concentrated stockholder base. As of March 31, 2022, our three largest stockholders beneficially owned or had the ability to direct the voting of shares of our common stock representing approximately 64% of the outstanding shares. As a result, these stockholders have the power to determine the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our board of directors. In addition, future sales by these stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the potential for such sales, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our securities.An increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our cash flow and negatively affect the results of our business operations.A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. In addition, if we refinance our indebtedness and interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.16Our inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could limit our operational flexibility and also impact our ability to make payments on our obligations as they come due.In addition to being capital intensive and highly leveraged, our aircraft and engine business requires that we maintain sufficient liquidity to enable us to contribute the non-financed portion of engine and aircraft purchases as well as to service our payment obligations to our creditors as they become due, despite the fact that the timing and amounts of our revenues do not match the timing under our debt service obligations. Our restricted cash is unavailable for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and maintain our operations depends on our ability to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity, cash and available credit under our credit facilities. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are subjected to one or more of the following:•a significant decline in revenues,•a material increase in interest expense that is not matched by a corresponding increase in revenues,•a significant increase in operating expenses,  •a reduction in our available credit under our credit facilities, or•general economic or national events. If we do not maintain sufficient liquidity, our ability to meet our payment obligations to creditors or to borrow additional funds could become impaired.Future cash flows from operations or through financings may not be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its obligations.Future cash flow of the Company’s operations can fluctuate significantly.  If future cash flows are not sufficient to permit the Company to meet its obligations, this would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company, its businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt. There can be no assurance that the Company or its subsidiaries will continue to have access to their lines of credit if their financial performance does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in the applicable financing agreements. If the Company or its subsidiaries do not meet certain of its financial covenants, and if they are unable to secure necessary waivers or other amendments from the respective lenders on terms acceptable to management and to renew or replace financing arrangements that mature during the current fiscal year, their ability to access available lines of credit could be limited, their debt obligations could be accelerated by the respective lenders and liquidity could be adversely affected.The Company and/or its subsidiaries may be required to seek additional or alternative financing sources if the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ cash needs are significantly greater than anticipated or they do not materially meet their business plans, or there are unanticipated downturns in the markets for the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ products and services. Future disruption and volatility in credit market conditions could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability, or that of its subsidiaries, to refinance debt when it comes due on terms similar to our current credit facilities, to draw upon existing lines of credit or to incur additional debt if needed. There can be no assurance therefore that such financing will be available or available on acceptable terms. The inability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or through financings or disruptions in the credit markets could impair the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ liquidity and would likely have a material adverse effect on their businesses, financial condition and results of operations.A large proportion of our capital is invested in physical assets and securities that can be hard to sell, especially if market conditions are poor. Because our investment strategy can involve public company securities, we may be restricted in our ability to effect sales during certain time periods. A lack of liquidity could limit our ability to vary our portfolio or assets promptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. Additionally, if financial or operating difficulties of other competitors result in distress sales, such sales could depress asset values in the markets in which we operate. The restrictions inherent in owning physical assets could reduce our ability to respond to changes in market conditions and could adversely affect the performance of our investments, our financial condition and results of operations. Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of illiquid or non-public investments, the fair values of such investments do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained when such investments are realized. To service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available. Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, will depend largely upon our future operating performance. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on our maintaining specified financial ratios and satisfying financial condition tests and other covenants in the agreements governing our debt. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available in amounts sufficient to pay our debt and to satisfy our other liquidity needs.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to seek alternatives.If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and aircraft or engine purchases, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and might require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. These 17alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or to meet our aircraft or engine purchase commitments as they come due.The transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our cost to obtain financing and may potentially negatively impact our interest rate swap agreements.It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR"") to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and various other authorities have commenced the publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR. The full impact of such reforms and actions, together with any transition away from LIBOR remains unclear.  These changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability and cost of our financing, including LIBOR-based loans, as well as our interest rate swap agreements.Despite our substantial indebtedness, we might incur significantly more debt, and cash may not be available to meet our financial obligations when due or enable us to capitalize on investment opportunities when they arise. We employ debt and other forms of leverage in the ordinary course of business to enhance returns to our investors and finance our operations, and despite our current indebtedness levels, we expect to incur additional debt in the future to finance our operations, including purchasing aircraft and engines and meeting our contractual obligations as the agreements relating to our debt, including our indentures, term loan facilities, revolving credit facilities, and other financings do not entirely prohibit us from incurring additional debt. We also enter into financing commitments in the normal course of business, which we may be required to fund. If we are required to fund these commitments and are unable to do so, we could be liable for damages pursued against us or a loss of opportunity through default under contracts that are otherwise to our benefit could occur.  We are therefore subject to the risks associated with debt financing and refinancing, including but not limited to the following: (i) our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; (ii) payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pay operating expenses and dividends; (iii) if we are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at high interest rates or on other unfavorable terms, we may have difficulty completing acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case; (iv) we may not be able to refinance indebtedness at maturity due to company and market factors such as the estimated cash flow produced by our assets, the value of our assets, liquidity in the debt markets, and/or financial, competitive, business and other factors; and (v) if we are able to refinance our indebtedness, the terms of a refinancing may not be as favorable as the original terms for such indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we may need to utilize available liquidity, which would reduce our ability to pursue new investment opportunities, dispose of one or more of our assets on disadvantageous terms, or raise equity, causing dilution to existing stockholders.The terms of our various credit agreements and other financing documents also require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios, adequate insurance coverage and certain credit ratings. These covenants may limit our flexibility in conducting our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, even if we have satisfied and continue to satisfy our payment obligations. Regulatory changes may also result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to credit.Our current financing arrangements require compliance with financial and other covenants and a failure to comply with such covenants could adversely affect our ability to operate.The terms of our various credit agreements and other financing documents also require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios, adequate insurance coverage and certain credit ratings. These covenants may limit our flexibility in conducting our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, even if we have satisfied and continue to satisfy our payment obligations. Regulatory changes may also result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to credit.Future acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and investments are possible, changing the components of our assets and liabilities, and if unsuccessful or unfavorable, could reduce the value of the Company and its securities.Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities, as well as our business mix and prospects. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time.We face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business.We expect the growth and development of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions, investments, and strategic partnering. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that financial controls, the level and knowledge of personnel, operational abilities, legal and compliance controls and other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, if we acquire new businesses and/or introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties concerning the integration of their controls and systems, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.18Our business strategy includes acquisitions, and acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the risk of management diversion and increased costs and expenses, all of which could negatively affect the Company’s ability to operate profitably.Our business strategy includes, among other things, strategic and opportunistic acquisitions. This element of our strategy entails several risks, including, but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the need to finance such acquisitions with additional equity and/or debt. In addition, once completed, acquisitions entail further risks, including: unanticipated costs and liabilities of the acquired businesses, including environmental liabilities, that could materially adversely affect our results of operations; difficulties in assimilating acquired businesses, preventing the expected benefits from the transaction from being realized or achieved within the anticipated time frame; negative effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and losing key employees of the acquired businesses. If our acquisition strategy is not successful or if acquisitions are not well integrated into our existing operations, the Company’s operations and business results could be negatively affected.Strategic ventures may increase risks applicable to our operations.We may enter into strategic ventures that pose risks, including a lack of complete control over the enterprise, and other potential unforeseen risks, any of which could adversely impact our financial results. We may occasionally enter into strategic ventures or investments with third parties in order to take advantage of favorable financing opportunities, to share capital or operating risk, or to earn aircraft management fees. These strategic ventures and investments may subject us to various risks, including those arising from our possessing limited decision-making rights in the enterprise or over the related aircraft. If we were unable to resolve a dispute with a strategic partner in such a venture that retains material managerial veto rights, we might reach an impasse which may lead to operational difficulties in the venture and increases costs or the liquidation of our investment at a time and in a manner that would result in our losing some or all of our original investment and/or the occurrence of other losses, which could adversely impact our financial results.Rapid business expansions or new business initiatives may increase risk.Certain business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses such as the relatively recent expansion at our commercial jet engines and parts segment and the establishment of a large aircraft asset management business and a new aircraft capital joint venture, may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes, new business plans and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks, and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held. There is no assurance that prior year activity and results will occur in future periods.Our policies and procedures may not be effective in ensuring compliance with applicable law.Our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. We could become subject to various governmental investigations, audits and inquiries, both formal and informal. Such investigations, regardless of their outcome, could be costly, divert management attention, and damage our reputation. The unfavorable resolution of such investigations could result in criminal liability, fines, penalties or other monetary or non-monetary sanctions and could materially affect our business or results of operations.Compliance with the regulatory requirements imposed on us as a public company results in significant costs that may have an adverse effect on our results.As a public company, we are subject to various regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, compliance with the rulesand regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Compliance with these rules and regulations results in significant additional costs to us both directly, through increased audit and consulting fees, and indirectly, through the time required by our limited resources to address such regulations.Deficiencies in our public company financial reporting and disclosures could adversely impact our reputation. As we expand the size and scope of our business, there is a greater susceptibility that our financial reporting and other public disclosure documents may contain material misstatements and that the controls we maintain to attempt to ensure the complete accuracy of our public disclosures may fail to operate as intended. The occurrence of such events could adversely impact our reputation and financial condition. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to give our stakeholders assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). However, the process for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial disclosures on a timely basis, or at all. Some of these processes may be new for certain subsidiaries in our structure, and in the case of acquisitions, may take time to be fully implemented. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under U.S. securities laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. Our policies and procedures governing disclosures may not ensure that all material information regarding us is disclosed in a proper and timely fashion or that we will be successful in preventing the disclosure of material information to a single person or a limited group of people before such information is generally disseminated.19"
5,AIRT,AIR T INC,2021-06-25,"    Risk Factors
.General Business RisksThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and other possible pandemics and similar outbreaks could result in material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in the United States and elsewhere created considerable instability and disruption in the U.S. and world economies. Substantial uncertainty still surrounds COVID-19 and its potential effects, as well as the extent and effectiveness of any responses taken on a national and local level. Measures taken to limit the impact of COVID-19, including shelter-in-place orders, social distancing measures and other restrictions on travel, congregation and business operations resulted in significant negative impacts in the United States and world economies and in relation to our business. The long-term impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and world economies remains uncertain and the duration and scope of the world-wide economic downturn cannot currently be predicted. The extent to which our financial condition, results of operations and overall value will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic, containment and the effectiveness of vaccine measures, among others.As a result of measures taken to limit the impact of COVID-19, self-quarantines or actual viral health issues, we initially experienced a substantial number of disruptions, and experienced a reduction in demand for commercial aircraft, jet engines and parts which negatively affected our sales and materially and adversely affected the financial performance and value of our inventory.  All of the markets in which our businesses are located were subject to some level of restrictions on business operations. Even as travel advisories and restrictions are modified or lifted, demand for air travel could remain weak or not recover to pre-pandemic levels for a significant length of time, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety, unwillingness to travel, and decreased consumer spending due to economic conditions, including job losses. We cannot predict if and when the demand for our commercial aircraft, jet engines and parts will return to pre-outbreak levels of volume and pricing. The market and economic challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures implemented to prevent its spread, adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect our returns and profitability. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease or other health concern, our company may be subject to similar risks as posed by COVID-19.Market fluctuations may affect our operations.Market fluctuations may affect our ability to obtain necessary funds for the operation of our businesses from current lenders or new borrowings.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Third-party reports relating to market studies or demographics we obtained prior to the COVID-19 virus outbreak may no longer be accurate or complete.  The occurrence of any of the foregoing events or any other related matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and the overall value of our assets.Labor inflation could impact our profitability. The Company operates in industries that are heavily impacted by the workforce’s labor rates. Significant examples include mechanics and pilots, both of which expose the Company to the possibility of material increases in labor costs. We could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses.We compete with many other organizations for skilled management and staff employees, including organizations that operate in different market sectors than us. Costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations.Legacy technology systems require a unique technical skillset which is becoming scarcer.The Company deploys legacy technology systems in several significant business units. As technology continues to rapidly change, the available pool of individuals technically trained in and able to repair or perform maintenance on these legacy systems shrinks. As this scarcity increases, the Company’s ability to efficiently and quickly repair its legacy systems becomes increasingly difficult, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s day-to-day operations.Our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.Our business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Although we have adopted certain measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the 9compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The failure of our information technology systems could adversely impact our reputation and financial performance.We operate in businesses that are dependent on information systems and technology. Our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, and/or the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from its current level. Either scenario could have a material adverse effect on us. We rely on third-party service providers to manage certain aspects of our business, including for certain information systems and technology, data processing systems, and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures of their information systems and technology could impair the quality of our operations and could adversely affect our business and reputation.We may not be able to insure certain risks adequately or economically.We cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur, or if we are required to pay a deductible for an insured loss, results of operations could be adversely affected.Legal liability may harm our business.Many aspects of our businesses involve substantial risks of liability, and, in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our businesses, including expansions into new products or markets, impose greater risks of liability. In addition, unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our businesses and our prospects. Although our current assessment is that there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact, if our assessment proves to be in error, then the outcome of such litigation could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Our business might suffer if we were to lose the services of certain key employees. Our business operations depend upon our key employees, including our executive officers. Loss of any of these employees, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our business as our key employees have knowledge of our industry and customers that would be difficult to replace. Risks Related to Our Segment OperationsThe operating results of our four segments may fluctuate, particularly our commercial jet engine and parts segment.The operating results of our four segments have varied from period to period and comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful. Due to a number of factors, including the risks described in this section, our operating results may fluctuate. These fluctuations may also be caused by, among other things:a.the economic health of the economy and the aviation industry in general;b.the timing and number of purchases and sales of engines or aircraft;c.the timing and amount of maintenance reserve revenues recorded resulting from the termination of long term leases, for which significant amounts of maintenance reserves may have accumulated;d.the termination or announced termination of production of particular aircraft and engine types;e.the retirement or announced retirement of particular aircraft models by aircraft operators;f.the operating history of any particular engine, aircraft or engine or aircraft model;g.the length of our operating leases; andh.the timing of necessary overhauls of engines and aircraft.These risks may reduce our commercial jet engines and parts segment's engine utilization rates, lease margins, maintenance reserve revenues and proceeds from engine sales, and result in higher legal, technical, maintenance, storage and insurance costs related to repossession and the cost of engines being off-lease. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the availability of engines for lease or sale periodically experiences cycles of oversupply and undersupply of given engine models and generally. The incidence of an oversupply of engines may produce substantial decreases in engine lease rates and the appraised and resale value of engines and may increase the time and costs incurred to lease or sell engines. We anticipate that supply fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. As a result, comparisons to results from preceding periods may not be meaningful and results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.Our Air Cargo Segment is dependent on a significant customer.Our Air Cargo business is significantly dependent on a contractual relationship with FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”), the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, 37% of our consolidated operating revenues, and 99% of the operating revenues for our overnight air cargo segment, arose from services we provided to FedEx. While FedEx has been our customer since 1980 under similar terms, our current agreements may be terminated by FedEx upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of 10any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, FedEx may terminate the dry-lease agreement with MAC or CSA upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes its only customer, or either MAC or CSA employs less than six employees. As of the date of issuance of this report, FedEx would be permitted to terminate each of the dry-lease agreements under this provision. The loss of these contracts with FedEx would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.Our dry-lease agreements with FedEx subject us to operating risks.Our dry-lease agreements with FedEx provide for the lease of specified aircraft by us in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased. The dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of our costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Under the dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by us in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are borne solely by us.Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations.  These risks are discussed in FedEx’s periodic reports filed with the SEC including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020.  These risks include but are not limited to the following:a.The negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic;b.Economic conditions and anti-trade measures/trade policies and relations in the global markets in which it operates;c.Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand;d.Potential disruption to operations resulting from a significant data breach or other disruption to FedEx’s technology infrastructure;e.The failure to efficiently integrate the business and operations of FedEx Express and TNT Express;f.The price and availability of fuel;g.FedEx's ability to manage capital and its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes;h.Changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally;i.Intense competition from other providers of transportation and business services;j.Changes in governmental regulations that may affect its business;k.FedEx's ability to operate, integrate, leverage and grow acquired businesses;l.Adverse changes in regulations and interpretations and challenges to its tax positions; m.Failure to attract and maintain employee talent or maintain company culture and its ability to maintain good relationships with its employees and prevent attempts by labor organizations to organize groups of its employees;n.Disruptions or modifications in service by the United States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx;o.The continued classification of owner-operators in its ground delivery business as independent contractors rather than as employees;p.The impact of proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations;q.The impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union;r.The impact of terrorist activities including the imposition of stricter governmental security requirements;s.Regulatory actions affecting global aviation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets;t.Global climate change or legal, regulatory or market responses to such change;u.Adverse weather or localized natural or man-made disasters in key locations, including its Memphis, Tennessee super-hub;v.Constraints, volatility or disruption in the capital markets and any failure to maintain credit ratings and to meet credit agreement covenants; andw.Widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis.A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly and FedEx may reduce the number of aircraft we lease and operate upon 10 days’ written notice.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction in any period could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period. Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions.Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units.We are affected by the risks faced by commercial aircraft operators and MRO companies because they are our customers.11Commercial aircraft operators are engaged in economically sensitive, highly cyclical and competitive businesses. We are a supplier to commercial aircraft operators and MROs. As a result, we are indirectly affected by all of the risks facing commercial aircraft operators and MROs, with such risks being largely beyond our control. Our results of operations depend, in part, on the financial strength of our customers and our customers’ ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and manage their risks. Our engine values and lease rates, which are dependent on the status of the types of aircraft on which engines are installed, and other factors, could decline.The value of a particular model of engine depends heavily on the types of aircraft on which it may be installed and the available supply of such engines. Values of engines generally tend to be relatively stable so long as there is sufficient demand for the host aircraft. However, the value of an engine may begin to decline rapidly once the host aircraft begins to be retired from service and/or used for spare parts in significant numbers. Certain types of engines may be used in significant numbers by commercial aircraft operators that are currently experiencing financial difficulties. If such operators were to go into liquidation or similar proceedings, the resulting over-supply of engines from these operators could have an adverse effect on the demand for the affected engine types and the values of such engines.Upon termination of a lease, we may be unable to enter into new leases or sell the airframe, engine or its parts on acceptable terms.We directly or indirectly own the engines or aircraft that we lease to customers and bear the risk of not recovering our entire investment through leasing and selling the engines or aircraft. Upon termination of a lease, we seek to enter a new lease or to sell or part-out the engine or aircraft. We also selectively sell engines on an opportunistic basis. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to find, in a timely manner, a lessee or a buyer for our engines or aircraft coming off-lease or for their associated parts. If we do find a lessee, we may not be able to obtain satisfactory lease rates and terms (including maintenance and redelivery conditions), and we cannot guarantee that the creditworthiness of any future lessee will be equal to or better than that of the existing lessees of our engines. Because the terms of engine leases may be less than 12 months, we may frequently need to remarket engines. We face the risk that we may not be able to keep our engines on lease consistently.Failures by lessees to meet their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations under our leases could adversely affect the value of our leased engines and aircraft which could affect our ability to re-lease the engines and aircraft in a timely manner following termination of the leases.The value and income producing potential of an engine or aircraft depends heavily on it being maintained in accordance with an approved maintenance system and complying with all applicable governmental directives and manufacturer requirements. In addition, for an engine or aircraft to be available for service, all records, logs, licenses and documentation relating to maintenance and operations of the engine or aircraft must be maintained in accordance with governmental and manufacturer specifications.  Under our leases, our lessees are primarily responsible for maintaining our aircraft and engines and complying with all governmental requirements applicable to the lessee and the aircraft and engines, including operational, maintenance, government agency oversight, registration requirements and airworthiness directives. However, over time, certain lessees have experienced, and may experience in the future, difficulties in meeting their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations as specified by the terms of our leases.  Failure by our lessees to maintain our assets in accordance with requirements could negatively affect the value and desirability of our assets and expose us to increased maintenance costs that may not be sufficiently covered by supplemental maintenance rents paid by such lessees.Our ability to determine the condition of the engines or aircraft and whether the lessees are properly maintaining our assets is generally limited to the lessees’ reporting of monthly usage and any maintenance performed, confirmed by periodic inspections performed by us and third-parties. A lessee’s failure to meet its maintenance or recordkeeping obligations under a lease could result in:a.a grounding of the related engine or aircraft;b.a repossession that would likely cause us to incur additional and potentially substantial expenditures in restoring the engine or aircraft to an acceptable maintenance condition;c.a need to incur additional costs and devote resources to recreate the records prior to the sale or lease of the engine or aircraft;d.a decline in the market value of the aircraft or engine resulting in lower revenues upon a subsequent lease or sale; e.loss of lease revenue while we perform refurbishments or repairs and recreate records; andf.a lower lease rate and/or shorter lease term under a new lease entered into by us following repossession of the engine or aircraft.Any of these events may adversely affect the value of the engine, unless and until remedied, and reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. If an engine is damaged during a lease and we are unable to recover from the lessee or though insurance, we may incur a loss.We may experience losses and delays in connection with repossession of engines or aircraft when a lessee defaults.We may not be able to repossess an engine or aircraft when the lessee defaults, and even if we are able to repossess the engine or aircraft, we may have to expend significant funds in the repossession, remarketing and leasing of the asset. When a lessee defaults and such default is not cured in a timely manner, we typically seek to terminate the lease and repossess the engine or aircraft. If a defaulting lessee contests the termination and repossession or is under court protection, enforcement of our rights under the lease may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. We may not realize any practical benefits from our legal rights and we may need to obtain consents to export the engine or aircraft. As a result, the relevant asset may be off-lease or not producing revenue for a prolonged period of time. In addition, we will incur direct costs associated with repossessing our engine or aircraft, including, but not limited to, legal and similar costs, the direct costs of transporting, storing and insuring the engine or aircraft, and costs associated with necessary maintenance and recordkeeping to make the asset available for lease or 12sale. During this time, we will realize no revenue from the leased engine or aircraft, and we will continue to be obligated to pay any debt financing associated with the asset. If an engine is installed on an airframe, the airframe may be owned by an aircraft lessor or other third party. Our ability to recover engines installed on airframes may depend on the cooperation of the airframe owner.Our commercial jet engine and parts segment and its customers operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell our engines or aircraft.Certain of the laws and regulations applicable to our business, include:Licenses and consents.  A number of our leases require specific governmental or regulatory licenses, consents or approvals. These include consents for certain payments under the leases and for the export, import or re-export of our engines or aircraft. Consents needed in connection with future leasing or sale of our engines or aircraft may not be received timely or have economically feasible terms. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to lease or sell engines or aircraft.Export/import regulations.  The U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Commerce Department”) regulates exports. We are subject to the Commerce Department’s and the U.S. Department of State’s regulations with respect to the lease and sale of engines and aircraft to foreign entities and the export of related parts. These Departments may, in some cases, require us to obtain export licenses for engines exported to foreign countries. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, enforces regulations related to the import of engines and aircraft into the United States for maintenance or lease and imports of parts for installation on our engines and aircraft.Restriction Lists.  We are prohibited from doing business with persons designated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) on its “Specially Designated Nationals List,” and must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with OFAC’s rules. Similarly, sanctions issued by the United Nations, the U.S. government, the European Union or other foreign governments could prohibit or restrict us from doing business in certain countries or with certain persons. As a result, we must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with such sanctions.Anti-corruption Laws. As a U.S. corporation with international operations, we are required to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations which combat corruption. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any official act or decision or securing any improper advantage. The scope and enforcement of such anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. Although our policies expressly mandate compliance with the FCPA and similarly applicable laws, there can be no assurance that none of our employees or agents will take any action in violation of our policies. Violations of such laws or regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties. Actual or alleged violations could also damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business.Civil aviation regulation. Users of engines and aircraft are subject to general civil aviation authorities, including the FAA and the EASA, who regulate the maintenance of engines and issue airworthiness directives. Airworthiness directives typically set forth special maintenance actions or modifications to certain engine and aircraft types or a series of specific engines that must be implemented for the engine or aircraft to remain in service. Also, airworthiness directives may require the lessee to make more frequent inspections of an engine, aircraft or particular engine parts. Each lessee of an engine or aircraft generally is responsible for complying with all airworthiness directives. However, if the engine or aircraft is off lease, we may be forced to bear the cost of compliance with such airworthiness directives. Additionally, even if the engine or aircraft is leased, subject to the terms of the lease, if any, we may still be forced to share the cost of compliance.Our aircraft, engines and parts could cause damage resulting in liability claims.  Our aircraft, engines or parts could cause bodily injury or property damage, exposing us to liability claims. Our leases require our lessees to indemnify us against these claims and to carry insurance customary in the air transportation industry, including general liability and property insurance at agreed upon levels. However, we cannot guarantee that one or more catastrophic events will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that lessees’ insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Any insurance coverage deficiency or default by lessees under their indemnification or insurance obligations may reduce our recovery of losses upon an event of loss.We have risks in managing our portfolio of aircraft and engines to meet customer needs.The relatively long life cycles of aircraft and jet engines can be shortened by world events, government regulation or customer preferences. We seek to manage these risks by trying to anticipate demand for particular engine and aircraft types, maintaining a portfolio mix of engines that we believe is diversified, has long-term value and will be sought by lessees in the global market for jet engines, and by selling engines and aircraft that we expect will not experience obsolescence or declining usefulness in the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that the engine and aircraft types owned or acquired by us will meet customer demand.Liens on our engines or aircraft could exceed the value of such assets, which could negatively affect our ability to repossess, lease or sell a particular engine or aircraft.Liens that secure the payment of repairers’ charges or other liens may, depending on the jurisdiction, attach to engines and aircraft. Engines also may be installed on airframes to which liens unrelated to the engines have attached. These liens may secure substantial sums that may, in certain jurisdictions or for certain types of liens, exceed the value of the particular engine or aircraft to which the liens have attached. In some jurisdictions, a lien may give the holder the right to detain or, in limited 13cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the engine or aircraft. Such liens may have priority over our interest as well as our creditors’ interest in the engines or aircraft. These liens and lien holders could impair our ability to repossess and lease or sell the engines or aircraft. We cannot give assurance that our lessees will comply with their obligations to discharge third-party liens on our assets. If they do not, we may, in the future, find it necessary to pay the claims secured by such liens to repossess such assets.In certain countries, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an addition to the aircraft and we may not be able to exercise our ownership rights over the engine. In certain jurisdictions, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an addition to the aircraft such that the ownership rights of the owner of the aircraft supersede the ownership rights of the owner of the engine. If an aircraft is security for the owner’s obligations to a third-party, the security interest in the aircraft may supersede our rights as owner of the engine. Such a security interest could limit our ability to repossess an engine located in such a jurisdiction in the event of a lessee bankruptcy or lease default. We may suffer a loss if we are not able to repossess engines leased to lessees in these jurisdictions.Higher or volatile fuel prices could affect the profitability of the aviation industry and our lessees’ ability to meet their lease payment obligations to us. Historically, fuel prices have fluctuated widely depending primarily on international market conditions, geopolitical and environmental factors and events and currency exchange rates. Natural and other disasters can also significantly affect fuel availability and prices. The cost of fuel represents a major expense to airlines that is not within their control, and significant increases in fuel costs or hedges that inaccurately assess the direction of fuel costs can materially and adversely affect their operating results. Due to the competitive nature of the aviation industry, operators may be unable to pass on increases in fuel prices to their customers by increasing fares in a manner that fully offsets the increased fuel costs they may incur. In addition, they may not be able to manage this risk by appropriately hedging their exposure to fuel price fluctuations. The profitability and liquidity of those airlines that do hedge their fuel costs can also be adversely affected by swift movements in fuel prices if such airlines are required to post cash collateral under hedge agreements. Therefore, if for any reason fuel prices return to historically high levels or show significant volatility, our lessees are likely to incur higher costs or generate lower revenues, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.Interruptions in the capital markets could impair our lessees’ ability to finance their operations, which could prevent the lessees from complying with payment obligations to us. The global financial markets can be highly volatile and the availability of credit from financial markets and financial institutions can vary substantially depending on developments in the global financial markets. Our lessees depend on banks and the capital markets to provide working capital and to refinance existing indebtedness. To the extent such funding is unavailable, or available only on unfavorable terms, and to the extent financial markets do not provide equity financing as an alternative, our lessees’ operations and operating results may be materially and adversely affected and they may not comply with their respective payment obligations to us.Our lessees may fail to adequately insure our aircraft or engines which could subject us to additional costs. While an aircraft or engine is on lease, we do not directly control its operation. Nevertheless, because we hold title to the aircraft or engine, we could, in certain jurisdictions, be held liable for losses resulting from its operation. At a minimum, we may be required to expend resources in our defense. We require our lessees to obtain specified levels of insurance and indemnify us for, and insure against, such operational liabilities. However, some lessees may fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage during a lease term, which, although constituting a breach of the lease, would require us to take some corrective action, such as terminating the lease or securing insurance for the aircraft or engines. Therefore, our lessees’ insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims that could be asserted against us arising from the operation of our aircraft or engines. Inadequate insurance coverage or default by lessees in fulfilling their indemnification or insurance obligations to us will reduce the insurance proceeds that we would otherwise be entitled to receive in the event we are sued and are required to make payments to claimants. Moreover, our lessees’ insurance coverage is dependent on the financial condition of insurance companies and their ability to pay claims. A reduction in insurance proceeds otherwise payable to us as a result of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results.If our lessees fail to cooperate in returning our aircraft or engines following lease terminations, we may encounter obstacles and are likely to incur significant costs and expenses conducting repossessions. Our legal rights and the relative difficulty of repossession vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction in which an aircraft or engines are located. We may need to obtain a court order or consents for de-registration or re-export, a process that can differ substantially from county to country. When a defaulting lessee is in bankruptcy, protective administration, insolvency or similar proceedings, additional limitations may also apply. For example, certain jurisdictions give rights to the trustee in bankruptcy or a similar officer to assume or reject the lease, to assign it to a third party, or to entitle the lessee or another third party to retain possession of the aircraft or engines without paying lease rentals or performing all or some of the obligations under the relevant lease. Certain of our lessees are partially or wholly owned by government-related entities, which can further complicate our efforts to repossess our aircraft or engines in that government’s jurisdiction. If we encounter any of these difficulties, we may be delayed in, or prevented from, enforcing certain of our rights under a lease and in re-leasing the affected aircraft or engines.When conducting a repossession, we are likely to incur significant costs and expenses that are unlikely to be recouped. These include legal and other expenses related to legal proceedings, including the cost of posting security bonds or letters of credit necessary to effect repossession of the aircraft or engines, particularly if the lessee is contesting the proceedings or is in bankruptcy. We must absorb the cost of lost revenue for the time the aircraft or engines are off-lease. We may incur substantial maintenance, refurbishment or repair costs that a defaulting lessee has failed to pay and are necessary to put the aircraft or engines in suitable condition for re-lease or sale. We may also incur significant costs in retrieving or recreating aircraft records 14required for registration of the aircraft and in obtaining the certificate of airworthiness for an aircraft. It may be necessary to pay to discharge liens or pay taxes and other governmental charges on the aircraft to obtain clear possession and to remarket the aircraft effectively, including, in some cases, liens that the lessee may have incurred in connection with the operation of its other aircraft. We may also incur other costs in connection with the physical possession of the aircraft or engines.If our lessees fail to discharge aircraft liens for which they are responsible, we may be obligated to pay to discharge the liens. In the normal course of their businesses, our lessees are likely to incur aircraft and engine liens that secure the payment of airport fees and taxes, custom duties, Eurocontrol and other air navigation charges, landing charges, crew wages, and other liens that may attach to our aircraft. Aircraft may also be subject to mechanic’s liens as a result of routine maintenance performed by third parties on behalf of our customers. Some of these liens can secure substantial sums, and if they attach to entire fleets of aircraft, as permitted for certain kinds of liens, they may exceed the value of the aircraft itself. Although the financial obligations relating to these liens are the contractual responsibility of our lessees, if they fail to fulfill their obligations, the liens may ultimately become our financial responsibility. Until they are discharged, these liens could impair our ability to repossess, re-lease or sell our aircraft or engines. In some jurisdictions, aircraft and engine liens may give the holder thereof the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the aircraft. If we are obliged to pay a large amount to discharge a lien, or if we are unable take possession of our aircraft subject to a lien in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could materially and adversely affect our financial results.If our lessees encounter financial difficulties and we restructure or terminate our leases, we are likely to obtain less favorable lease terms. If a lessee delays, reduces, or fails to make rental payments when due, or has advised us that it will do so in the future, we may elect or be required to restructure or terminate the lease. A restructured lease will likely contain terms that are less favorable to us. If we are unable to agree on a restructuring and we terminate the lease, we may not receive all or any payments still outstanding, and we may be unable to re-lease the aircraft or engines promptly and at favorable rates, if at all.Withdrawal, suspension or revocation of governmental authorizations or approvals could negatively affect our business.We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business. Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and operation of aircraft operated in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, such as the EASA in Europe, regulate aircraft operated in those countries. With the aircraft, engines and related parts that we purchase, lease and sell to our customers, we include documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. With respect to a particular engine or engine component, we utilize FAA and/or EASA certified repair stations to repair and certify engines and components to ensure marketability. The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New and more stringent government regulations, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries require approval or licensing from the U.S. government. Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Our Structure and Financing/Liquidity RisksOur holding company structure may increase risks related to our operations.Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon those of our individual businesses, and our aggregate investment in particular industries. We are a holding company with investments in businesses and assets in a number of industries. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon our various businesses and investments and their management teams. Each of our businesses generally operate independently and in a decentralized manner.  Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we guarantee the obligations of entities that we manage and/or invest in.  Any material adverse change in one of our businesses, investments or management teams, or in a particular industry in which we operate or invest, may cause material adverse changes to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The more capital we devote to a particular investment or industry may increase the risk that such investment could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations, possibly in a material adverse way.A small number of stockholders has the ability to control the Company.We have a very concentrated stockholder base. As of March 31, 2021, our three largest stockholders beneficially owned or had the ability to direct the voting of shares of our common stock representing approximately 62% of the outstanding shares. As a result, these stockholders have the power to determine the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our board of directors. In addition, future sales by these stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the potential for such sales, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our securities.An increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our cash flow and negatively affect the results of our business operations.15A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. In addition, if we refinance our indebtedness and interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could limit our operational flexibility and also impact our ability to make payments on our obligations as they come due.In addition to being capital intensive and highly leveraged, our aircraft and engine business requires that we maintain sufficient liquidity to enable us to contribute the non-financed portion of engine and aircraft purchases as well as to service our payment obligations to our creditors as they become due, despite the fact that the timing and amounts of our revenues do not match the timing under our debt service obligations. Our restricted cash is unavailable for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and maintain our operations depends on our ability to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity, cash and available credit under our credit facilities. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are subjected to one or more of the following:•a significant decline in revenues,•a material increase in interest expense that is not matched by a corresponding increase in revenues,•a significant increase in operating expenses,  •a reduction in our available credit under our credit facilities, or•general economic or national events. If we do not maintain sufficient liquidity, our ability to meet our payment obligations to creditors or to borrow additional funds could become impaired.Future cash flows from operations or through financings may not be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its obligations.Future cash flow of the Company’s operations can fluctuate significantly.  If future cash flows are not sufficient to permit the Company to meet its obligations, this would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company, its businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt - certain of which mature in the next twelve months. There can be no assurance that the Company or its subsidiaries will continue to have access to their lines of credit if their financial performance does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in the applicable financing agreements. If the Company or its subsidiaries do not meet certain of its financial covenants, and if they are unable to secure necessary waivers or other amendments from the respective lenders on terms acceptable to management and to renew or replace financing arrangements that mature during the current fiscal year, their ability to access available lines of credit could be limited, their debt obligations could be accelerated by the respective lenders and liquidity could be adversely affected.The Company and/or its subsidiaries may be required to seek additional or alternative financing sources if the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ cash needs are significantly greater than anticipated or they do not materially meet their business plans, or there are unanticipated downturns in the markets for the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ products and services. Future disruption and volatility in credit market conditions could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability, or that of its subsidiaries, to refinance debt when it comes due on terms similar to our current credit facilities, to draw upon existing lines of credit or to incur additional debt if needed. There can be no assurance therefore that such financing will be available or available on acceptable terms. The inability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or through financings or disruptions in the credit markets could impair the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ liquidity and would likely have a material adverse effect on their businesses, financial condition and results of operations.A large proportion of our capital is invested in physical assets and securities that can be hard to sell, especially if market conditions are poor. Because our investment strategy can involve public company securities, we may be restricted in our ability to effect sales during certain time periods. A lack of liquidity could limit our ability to vary our portfolio or assets promptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. Additionally, if financial or operating difficulties of other competitors result in distress sales, such sales could depress asset values in the markets in which we operate. The restrictions inherent in owning physical assets could reduce our ability to respond to changes in market conditions and could adversely affect the performance of our investments, our financial condition and results of operations. Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of illiquid or non-public investments, the fair values of such investments do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained when such investments are realized. To service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available. Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, will depend largely upon our future operating performance. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on our maintaining specified financial ratios and satisfying financial condition tests and other covenants in the agreements governing our debt. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available in amounts sufficient to pay our debt and to satisfy our other liquidity needs.16If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to seek alternatives.If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and aircraft or engine purchases, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and might require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or to meet our aircraft or engine purchase commitments as they come due.The transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our cost to obtain financing and may potentially negatively impact our interest rate swap agreements.It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR"") to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and various other authorities have commenced the publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR. The full impact of such reforms and actions, together with any transition away from LIBOR remains unclear.  These changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability and cost of our financing, including LIBOR-based loans, as well as our interest rate swap agreements.Despite our substantial indebtedness, we might incur significantly more debt, and cash may not be available to meet our financial obligations when due or enable us to capitalize on investment opportunities when they arise. We employ debt and other forms of leverage in the ordinary course of business to enhance returns to our investors and finance our operations, and despite our current indebtedness levels, we expect to incur additional debt in the future to finance our operations, including purchasing aircraft and engines and meeting our contractual obligations as the agreements relating to our debt, including our indentures, term loan facilities, revolving credit facilities, and other financings do not entirely prohibit us from incurring additional debt. We also enter into financing commitments in the normal course of business, which we may be required to fund. If we are required to fund these commitments and are unable to do so, we could be liable for damages pursued against us or a loss of opportunity through default under contracts that are otherwise to our benefit could occur.  We are therefore subject to the risks associated with debt financing and refinancing, including but not limited to the following: (i) our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; (ii) payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pay operating expenses and dividends; (iii) if we are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at high interest rates or on other unfavorable terms, we may have difficulty completing acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case; (iv) we may not be able to refinance indebtedness at maturity due to company and market factors such as the estimated cash flow produced by our assets, the value of our assets, liquidity in the debt markets, and/or financial, competitive, business and other factors; and (v) if we are able to refinance our indebtedness, the terms of a refinancing may not be as favorable as the original terms for such indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we may need to utilize available liquidity, which would reduce our ability to pursue new investment opportunities, dispose of one or more of our assets on disadvantageous terms, or raise equity, causing dilution to existing stockholders.The terms of our various credit agreements and other financing documents also require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios, adequate insurance coverage and certain credit ratings. These covenants may limit our flexibility in conducting our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, even if we have satisfied and continue to satisfy our payment obligations. Regulatory changes may also result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to credit.Future acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and investments are possible, changing the components of our assets and liabilities, and if unsuccessful or unfavorable, could reduce the value of the Company and its securities.Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities, as well as our business mix and prospects. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time.We face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business.We expect the growth and development of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions, investments, and strategic partnering. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that financial controls, the level and knowledge of personnel, operational abilities, legal and compliance controls and other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, if we acquire new businesses and/or introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties concerning the integration of their controls and systems, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.17Our business strategy includes acquisitions, and acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the risk of management diversion and increased costs and expenses, all of which could negatively affect the Company’s ability to operate profitably.Our business strategy includes, among other things, strategic and opportunistic acquisitions. This element of our strategy entails several risks, including, but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the need to finance such acquisitions with additional equity and/or debt. In addition, once completed, acquisitions entail further risks, including: unanticipated costs and liabilities of the acquired businesses, including environmental liabilities, that could materially adversely affect our results of operations; difficulties in assimilating acquired businesses, preventing the expected benefits from the transaction from being realized or achieved within the anticipated time frame; negative effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and losing key employees of the acquired businesses. If our acquisition strategy is not successful or if acquisitions are not well integrated into our existing operations, the Company’s operations and business results could be negatively affected.Strategic ventures may increase risks applicable to our operations.We may enter into strategic ventures that pose risks, including a lack of complete control over the enterprise, and other potential unforeseen risks, any of which could adversely impact our financial results. We may occasionally enter into strategic ventures or investments with third parties in order to take advantage of favorable financing opportunities, to share capital or operating risk, or to earn aircraft management fees. These strategic ventures and investments may subject us to various risks, including those arising from our possessing limited decision-making rights in the enterprise or over the related aircraft. If we were unable to resolve a dispute with a strategic partner in such a venture that retains material managerial veto rights, we might reach an impasse which may lead to operational difficulties in the venture and increases costs or the liquidation of our investment at a time and in a manner that would result in our losing some or all of our original investment and/or the occurrence of other losses, which could adversely impact our financial results.Rapid business expansions or new business initiatives may increase risk.Certain business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses such as the relatively recent substantial expansion at our commercial jet engines and parts segment and the establishment of a large aircraft asset management business and a new aircraft capital joint venture, may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes, new business plans and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks, and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held. There is no assurance that prior year activity and results will occur in future periods.Our policies and procedures may not be effective in ensuring compliance with applicable law.Our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. We could become subject to various governmental investigations, audits and inquiries, both formal and informal. Such investigations, regardless of their outcome, could be costly, divert management attention, and damage our reputation. The unfavorable resolution of such investigations could result in criminal liability, fines, penalties or other monetary or non-monetary sanctions and could materially affect our business or results of operations.Compliance with the regulatory requirements imposed on us as a public company results in significant costs that may have an adverse effect on our results.As a public company, we are subject to various regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, compliance with the rulesand regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Compliance with these rules and regulations results in significant additional costs to us both directly, through increased audit and consulting fees, and indirectly, through the time required by our limited resources to address such regulations.Deficiencies in our public company financial reporting and disclosures could adversely impact our reputation. As we expand the size and scope of our business, there is a greater susceptibility that our financial reporting and other public disclosure documents may contain material misstatements and that the controls we maintain to attempt to ensure the complete accuracy of our public disclosures may fail to operate as intended. The occurrence of such events could adversely impact our reputation and financial condition. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to give our stakeholders assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). However, the process for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial disclosures on a timely basis, or at all. Some of these processes may be new for certain subsidiaries in our structure, and in the case of acquisitions, may take time to be fully implemented. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under U.S. securities laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. Our policies and procedures governing disclosures may not ensure that all material information regarding us is disclosed in a proper and timely fashion or that we will be successful in preventing the disclosure of material information to a single person or a limited group of people before such information is generally disseminated.18Risks Related to Our Investments in SecuritiesOur results of operations may be affected by the value of securities we hold for investment and we may be unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner or at full value.We invest a significant portion of our capital not needed for operations in marketable securities, including equity securities of publicly-traded companies. At March 31, 2021, the fair value of these marketable securities was approximately $2.9 million. The value of our investment portfolio fluctuates and we have sustained losses in our investment portfolio in the past and could in the future. Such declines in value of available-for-sale securities will be recognized as losses upon the sale of such securities or if such declines are deemed to be other than temporary. Our results of operations may be affected by gains or losses recognized upon such a decline in value of our investments or the sale of these investments and the Company may not be able to realize the fair value of such investments under then-market conditions if liquidation is necessary in a short period of time"

.The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and other possible pandemics and similar outbreaks could result in material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus that has rapidly spread to a growing number of countries, including the United States, has created considerable instability and disruption in the U.S. and world economies. Substantial uncertainty still surrounds COVID-19 and its potential effects, as well as the extent and effectiveness of any responses taken on a national and local level. However, measures taken to limit the impact of COVID-19, including shelter-in-place orders, social distancing measures and other restrictions on travel, congregation and business operations have already resulted in significant negative impacts in the United States and world economies and in relation to our business. The long-term impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and world economies remains uncertain, but is likely to result in a world-wide economic downturn, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted. The extent to which our financial condition, results of operations and overall value will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others.9As a result of measures taken to limit the impact of COVID-19, self-quarantines or actual viral health issues, we initially experienced a substantial number of disruptions, and have experienced and continue to experience a reduction in demand for commercial aircraft, jet engines and parts which have negatively affected our sales and could materially and adversely affect the financial performance and value of our inventory.  All of the markets in which our businesses are located are subject to some level of restrictions on business operations. Even after travel advisories and restrictions are modified or lifted, demand for air travel may remain weak for a significant length of time, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety, unwillingness to travel, and decreased consumer spending due to economic conditions, including job losses. We cannot predict if and when the demand for our commercial aircraft, jet engines and parts will return to pre-outbreak levels of volume and pricing. The market and economic challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures implemented to prevent its spread, have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect our returns and profitability.Additionally, market fluctuations may affect our ability to obtain necessary funds for the operation of our businesses from current lenders or new borrowings.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Third-party reports relating to market studies or demographics we obtained prior to the COVID-19 virus outbreak may no longer be accurate or complete.  The occurrence of any of the foregoing events or any other related matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and the overall value of our assets.The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly, and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures, among others. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease or other health concern, our company may be subject to similar risks as posed by COVID-19.Our Air Cargo Segment is dependent on a significant customer.We are significantly dependent on our contractual relationship with FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”), the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, 30% of our consolidated operating revenues, and 96% of the operating revenues for our overnight air cargo segment, arose from services we provided to FedEx. While FedEx has been our customer since 1980 under similar terms, our current agreements may be terminated by FedEx upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, FedEx may terminate the dry-lease agreement with MAC or CSA upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes its only customer, or either MAC or CSA employs less than six employees. As of the date of issuance of this report, FedEx would be permitted to terminate each of the dry-lease agreements under this provision. The loss of these contracts with FedEx would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.In April 2019, FedEx informed the Company of a strategic realignment in the Caribbean region. The change affected the service provided by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, MAC, in that region and MAC assets and services were transferred to a new carrier. As a result of this realignment approximately 11 aircraft were transitioned to a different carrier resulting in an approximate $1.7 million reduction in revenue and an approximate $0.1 million reduction in net income at this segment during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.Our dry-lease agreements with FedEx subject us to greater operating risks.Our dry-lease agreements with FedEx provide for the lease of specified aircraft by us in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased. The dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of our costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Under the dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by us in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are borne solely by us.Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations.  These risks are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Risk Factors
” in FedEx’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019 (updated as necessary for the Q3 Form 10-Q for the period ended February 29, 2020).  These risks include but are not limited to the following:a.Economic conditions in the global markets in which it operates;b.Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand;10c.Potential disruption to operations resulting from a significant data breach or other disruption to FedEx’s technology infrastructure;d.The price and availability of fuel;e.Its ability to manage capital and its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes;f.Changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally;g.Intense competition from other providers of transportation and business services;h.Changes in governmental regulations that may affect its business;i.Its ability to operate, integrate, leverage and grow acquired businesses;j.Adverse changes in regulations and interpretations and challenges to its tax positions relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;k.Its ability to maintain good relationships with its employees and prevent attempts by labor organizations to organize groups of its employees;l.Disruptions or modifications in service by the United States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx;m.The continued classification of owner-operators in its ground delivery business as independent contractors rather than as employees;n.The impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union;o.The impact of terrorist activities including the imposition of stricter governmental security requirements;p.Regulatory actions affecting global aviation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets;q.Global climate change or legal, regulatory or market responses to such change;r.Adverse weather or localized natural or man-made disasters in key locations, including its Memphis, Tennessee super-hub; ands.Widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis.A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly and FedEx may reduce the number of aircraft we lease and operate upon 10 days’ written notice.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction in any period could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period. Our holding company structure may increase risks related to our operations.Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon those of our individual businesses, and our aggregate investment in particular industries. We are a holding company with investments in businesses and assets in a number of industries. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon our various businesses and investments and these businesses generally operate independently and in a decentralized manner.  Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we guarantee the obligations of other entities that we manage and/or invest in.  Any material adverse change in one of our businesses or investments, or in a particular industry in which we operate or invest, may cause material adverse changes to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The more capital we devote to a particular investment or industry may increase the risk that such investment could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations, possibly in a material adverse way.Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions.Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units.Our results of operations may be affected by the value of securities we hold for investment and we may be unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner or at full value.We invest a significant portion of our capital not needed for operations in marketable securities, including equity securities of publicly-traded companies. At March 31, 2020, the fair value of these marketable securities was approximately $3.2 million. The value of our investment portfolio fluctuates and we have sustained losses in our investment portfolio in the past and could in the future. Such declines in value of available-for-sale securities will be recognized as losses upon the sale of such securities or if such declines are deemed to be other than temporary. Our results of operations may be affected by gains or losses recognized upon such a decline in value of our investments or the sale of these investments and the Company may not be able to realize the fair value of such investments under then-market conditions if liquidation is necessary in a short period of time.Our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.11Our business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Although we have adopted certain measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Labor inflation could impact our profitability. The Company operates in industries that are heavily impacted by the workforce’s labor rates. Significant examples include mechanics and pilots, both of which are exposed to the possibility of material increases in labor costs. Legacy technology systems require a unique technical skillset which is becoming scarcer.The Company deploys legacy technology systems in several significant business units. As technology continues to rapidly change, the available pool of individuals technically trained in these legacy systems shrinks. As this scarcity increases, the Company’s ability to efficiently and quickly repair its legacy systems becomes increasingly difficult, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s day-to-day operations.Future acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and investments are possible, changing the components of our assets and liabilities, and if unsuccessful or unfavorable, could reduce the value of the Company and its securities.Any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities, as well as our business mix and prospects. Consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition, results of operations and trading price at the present time.We face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business.We expect the growth and development of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions, investments, and strategic partnering. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that financial controls, the level and knowledge of personnel, operational abilities, legal and compliance controls and other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, if we acquire new businesses and introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties concerning the integration of their controls and systems, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.Rapid business expansions or new business initiatives may increase risk.Certain business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses such as the relatively recent substantial expansion at our commercial jet engines and parts segment, may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes, new business plans and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks, and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held. There is no assurance that prior year activity and results will occur in future periods.The failure of our information technology systems could adversely impact our reputation and financial performance.We operate in businesses that are dependent on information systems and technology. Our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, and/or the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from its current level. Either scenario could have a material adverse effect on us. We rely on third-party service providers to manage certain aspects of our business, including for certain information systems and technology, data processing systems, and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures of their information systems and technology could impair the quality of our operations and could adversely affect our business and reputation.We may not be able to insure certain risks adequately or economically.12We cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur, or if we are required to pay a deductible for an insured loss, results of operations could be adversely affected.We could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses.We compete with many other organizations for skilled management and staff employees, including organizations that operate in different market sectors than us. Costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations.Legal liability may harm our business.Many aspects of our businesses involve substantial risks of liability, and, in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our businesses, including expansions into new products or markets, impose greater risks of liability. In addition, unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our businesses and our prospects. Although our current assessment is that there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact, if our assessment proves to be in error, then the outcome of such litigation could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Future cash flows from operations or through financings may not be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its obligations.Future cash flow of the Company’s operations can fluctuate significantly.  If future cash flows are not sufficient to permit the Company to meet its obligations, this would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company, its businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt. There can be no assurances that the Company or its subsidiaries will continue to have access to their lines of credit if their financial performance does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in the applicable financing agreements. If the Company or its subsidiaries do not meet certain of its financial covenants, and if they are unable to secure necessary waivers or other amendments from the respective lenders on terms acceptable to management, their ability to access available lines of credit could be limited, their debt obligations could be accelerated by the respective lenders and liquidity could be adversely affected.The Company and/or its subsidiaries may be required to seek additional or alternative financing sources if the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ cash needs are significantly greater than anticipated or they do not materially meet their business plans, or there are unanticipated downturns in the markets for the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ products and services. Future disruption and volatility in credit market conditions could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability, or that of its subsidiaries, to refinance debt when it comes due on terms similar to our current credit facilities, to draw upon existing lines of credit or to incur additional debt if needed. There can be no assurance therefore that such financing will be available or available on acceptable terms. The inability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or through financings could impair the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ liquidity and would likely have a material adverse effect on their businesses, financial condition and results of operations.Our business strategy includes acquisitions, and acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the risk of management diversion and increased costs and expenses, all of which could negatively affect the Company’s ability to operate profitably.Our business strategy includes, among other things, strategic and opportunistic acquisitions. This element of our strategy entails several risks, including, but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the need to finance such acquisitions with additional equity and/or debt. In addition, once completed, acquisitions entail further risks, including: unanticipated costs and liabilities of the acquired businesses, including environmental liabilities, that could materially adversely affect our results of operations; difficulties in assimilating acquired businesses, preventing the expected benefits from the transaction from being realized or achieved within the anticipated time frame; negative effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and losing key employees of the acquired businesses. If our acquisition strategy is not successful or if acquisitions are not well integrated into our existing operations, the Company’s profitability could be negatively affected.We are affected by the risks faced by commercial aircraft operators and maintenance, repair and overhaul companies (“MROs”) because they are our customers.Commercial aircraft operators are engaged in economically sensitive, highly cyclical and competitive businesses. We are a supplier to commercial aircraft operators and MROs. As a result, we are indirectly affected by all of the risks facing commercial aircraft operators and MROs, with such risks being largely beyond our control. Our results of operations depend, in part, on the financial strength of our customers and our customers’ ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and manage their risks. 13Our engine values and lease rates, which are dependent on the status of the types of aircraft on which engines are installed, and other factors, could decline.The value of a particular model of engine depends heavily on the types of aircraft on which it may be installed and the available supply of such engines. Values of engines generally tend to be relatively stable so long as there is sufficient demand for the host aircraft. However, the value of an engine may begin to decline rapidly once the host aircraft begins to be retired from service and/or used for spare parts in significant numbers. Certain types of engines may be used in significant numbers by commercial aircraft operators that are currently experiencing financial difficulties. If such operators were to go into liquidation or similar proceedings, the resulting over-supply of engines from these operators could have an adverse effect on the demand for the affected engine types and the values of such engines.Upon termination of a lease, we may be unable to enter into new leases or sell the airframe, engine or its parts on acceptable terms.We directly or indirectly own the engines or aircraft that we lease to customers and bear the risk of not recovering our entire investment through leasing and selling the engines or aircraft. Upon termination of a lease, we seek to enter a new lease or to sell or part-out the engine or aircraft. We also selectively sell engines on an opportunistic basis. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to find, in a timely manner, a lessee or a buyer for our engines or aircraft coming off-lease or for their associated parts. If we do find a lessee, we may not be able to obtain satisfactory lease rates and terms (including maintenance and redelivery conditions), and we cannot guarantee that the creditworthiness of any future lessee will be equal to or better than that of the existing lessees of our engines. Because the terms of engine leases may be less than 12 months, we may frequently need to remarket engines. We face the risk that we may not be able to keep our engines on lease consistently.Failures by lessees to meet their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations under our leases could adversely affect the value of our leased engines and aircraft and therefore our ability to re-lease the engines and aircraft in a timely manner following termination of the leases.The value and income producing potential of an engine or aircraft depends heavily on it being maintained in accordance with an approved maintenance system and complying with all applicable governmental directives and manufacturer requirements. In addition, for an engine or aircraft to be available for service, all records, logs, licenses and documentation relating to maintenance and operations of the engine or aircraft must be maintained in accordance with governmental and manufacturer specifications.  Under our leases, our lessees are primarily responsible for maintaining our aircraft and engines and complying with all governmental requirements applicable to the lessee and the aircraft and engines, including operational, maintenance, government agency oversight, registration requirements and airworthiness directives. However, over time, certain lessees have experienced, and may experience in the future, difficulties in meeting their maintenance and recordkeeping obligations as specified by the terms of our leases.  Failure by our lessees to maintain our assets in accordance with requirements could negatively affect the value and desirability of our assets and expose us to increased maintenance costs that may not be sufficiently covered by supplemental maintenance rents paid by such lessees.Our ability to determine the condition of the engines or aircraft and whether the lessees are properly maintaining our assets is generally limited to the lessees’ reporting of monthly usage and any maintenance performed, confirmed by periodic inspections performed by us and third-parties. A lessee’s failure to meet its maintenance or recordkeeping obligations under a lease could result in:a.a grounding of the related engine or aircraft;b.a repossession that would likely cause us to incur additional and potentially substantial expenditures in restoring the engine or aircraft to an acceptable maintenance condition;c.a need to incur additional costs and devote resources to recreate the records prior to the sale or lease of the engine or aircraft;d.a decline in the market value of the aircraft or engine resulting in lower revenues upon a subsequent lease or sale; e.loss of lease revenue while we perform refurbishments or repairs and recreate records; andf.a lower lease rate and/or shorter lease term under a new lease entered into by us following repossession of the engine or aircraft.Any of these events may adversely affect the value of the engine, unless and until remedied, and reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. If an engine is damaged during a lease and we are unable to recover from the lessee or though insurance, we may incur a loss.The operating results of our five segments may fluctuate.The operating results of our five segments have varied from period to period and comparisons to results for preceding periods may not be meaningful. Due to a number of factors, including the risks described in this section, our operating results may fluctuate. These fluctuations may also be caused by:a.the economic health of the economy and the airplane industry in general;b. timing and number of purchases and sales of engines or aircraft;c.the timing and amount of maintenance reserve revenues recorded resulting from the termination of long term leases, for which significant amounts of maintenance reserves may have accumulated;14d.the termination or announced termination of production of particular aircraft and engine types;e.the retirement or announced retirement of particular aircraft models by aircraft operators;f.the operating history of any particular engine, aircraft or engine or aircraft model;g.the length of our operating leases; andh.the timing of necessary overhauls of engines and aircraft.These risks may reduce our commercial jet engines and parts segment's engine utilization rates, lease margins, maintenance reserve revenues and proceeds from engine sales, and result in higher legal, technical, maintenance, storage and insurance costs related to repossession and the cost of engines being off-lease. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the availability of engines for lease or sale periodically experiences cycles of oversupply and undersupply of given engine models and generally. The incidence of an oversupply of engines may produce substantial decreases in engine lease rates and the appraised and resale value of engines and may increase the time and costs incurred to lease or sell engines. We anticipate that supply fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. As a result, comparisons to results from preceding periods may not be meaningful and results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.We may experience losses and delays in connection with repossession of engines or aircraft when a lessee defaults.We may not be able to repossess an engine or aircraft when the lessee defaults, and even if we are able to repossess the engine or aircraft, we may have to expend significant funds in the repossession, remarketing and leasing of the asset. When a lessee defaults and such default is not cured in a timely manner, we typically seek to terminate the lease and repossess the engine or aircraft. If a defaulting lessee contests the termination and repossession or is under court protection, enforcement of our rights under the lease may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. We may not realize any practical benefits from our legal rights and we may need to obtain consents to export the engine or aircraft. As a result, the relevant asset may be off-lease or not producing revenue for a prolonged period of time. In addition, we will incur direct costs associated with repossessing our engine or aircraft, including, but not limited to, legal and similar costs, the direct costs of transporting, storing and insuring the engine or aircraft, and costs associated with necessary maintenance and recordkeeping to make the asset available for lease or sale. During this time, we will realize no revenue from the leased engine or aircraft, and we will continue to be obligated to pay any debt financing associated with the asset. If an engine is installed on an airframe, the airframe may be owned by an aircraft lessor or other third party. Our ability to recover engines installed on airframes may depend on the cooperation of the airframe owner.The Company and its customers operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell our engines or aircraft.Certain of the laws and regulations applicable to our business, include:Licenses and consents.  A number of our leases require specific governmental or regulatory licenses, consents or approvals. These include consents for certain payments under the leases and for the export, import or re-export of our engines or aircraft. Consents needed in connection with future leasing or sale of our engines or aircraft may not be received timely or have economically feasible terms. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to lease or sell engines or aircraft.Export/import regulations.  The U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Commerce Department”) regulates exports. We are subject to the Commerce Department’s and the U.S. Department of State’s regulations with respect to the lease and sale of engines and aircraft to foreign entities and the export of related parts. These Departments may, in some cases, require us to obtain export licenses for engines exported to foreign countries. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, enforces regulations related to the import of engines and aircraft into the United States for maintenance or lease and imports of parts for installation on our engines and aircraft.Restriction Lists.  We are prohibited from doing business with persons designated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) on its “Specially Designated Nationals List,” and must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with OFAC’s rules. Similarly, sanctions issued by the United Nations, the U.S. government, the European Union or other foreign governments could prohibit or restrict us from doing business in certain countries or with certain persons. As a result, we must monitor our operations and existing and potential lessees and other counterparties for compliance with such sanctions.Anti-corruption Laws. As a U.S. corporation with international operations, we are required to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations which combat corruption. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any official act or decision or securing any improper advantage. The scope and enforcement of such anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. Although our policies expressly mandate compliance with the FCPA and similarly applicable laws, there can be no assurance that none of our employees or agents will take any action in violation of our policies. Violations of such laws or regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties. Actual or alleged violations could also damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business.Civil aviation regulation. Users of engines and aircraft are subject to general civil aviation authorities, including the FAA and the EASA, who regulate the maintenance of engines and issue airworthiness directives. Airworthiness directives typically set 15forth special maintenance actions or modifications to certain engine and aircraft types or a series of specific engines that must be implemented for the engine or aircraft to remain in service. Also, airworthiness directives may require the lessee to make more frequent inspections of an engine, aircraft or particular engine parts. Each lessee of an engine or aircraft generally is responsible for complying with all airworthiness directives. However, if the engine or aircraft is off lease, we may be forced to bear the cost of compliance with such airworthiness directives. Additionally, even if the engine or aircraft is leased, subject to the terms of the lease, if any, we may still be forced to share the cost of compliance.Our aircraft, engines and parts could cause damage resulting in liability claims.  Our aircraft, engines or parts could cause bodily injury or property damage, exposing us to liability claims. Our leases require our lessees to indemnify us against these claims and to carry insurance customary in the air transportation industry, including general liability and property insurance at agreed upon levels. However, we cannot guarantee that one or more catastrophic events will not exceed insurance coverage limits or that lessees’ insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Any insurance coverage deficiency or default by lessees under their indemnification or insurance obligations may reduce our recovery of losses upon an event of loss.An increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.A portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase our cost of servicing our debt and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. In addition, if we refinance our indebtedness and interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.The transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our cost to obtain financing and may potentially negatively impact our interest rate swap agreements.Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) based on observable market transactions. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR through the end of 2021, but that it will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond such date. Accordingly, there is uncertainty regarding the publication of such rates beyond 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and various other authorities have commenced the publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR. The full impact of such reforms and actions, together with any transition away from LIBOR, including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication, remains unclear.  These changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability and cost of our financing, including LIBOR-based loans, as well as our interest rate swap agreements.We have risks in managing our portfolio of aircraft and engines to meet customer needs.The relatively long life cycles of aircraft and jet engines can be shortened by world events, government regulation or customer preferences. We seek to manage these risks by trying to anticipate demand for particular engine and aircraft types, maintaining a portfolio mix of engines that we believe is diversified, has long-term value and will be sought by lessees in the global market for jet engines, and by selling engines and aircraft that we expect will not experience obsolescence or declining usefulness in the foreseeable future.Our inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could limit our operational flexibility and also impact our ability to make payments on our obligations as they come due.In addition to being capital intensive and highly leveraged, our aircraft and engine business requires that we maintain sufficient liquidity to enable us to contribute the non-financed portion of engine and aircraft purchases as well as to service our payment obligations to our creditors as they become due, despite the fact that the timing and amounts of our revenues do not match the timing under our debt service obligations. Our restricted cash is unavailable for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and maintain our operations depends on our ability to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity, cash and available credit under our credit facilities. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are subjected to one or more of the following:•a significant decline in revenues,•a material increase in interest expense that is not matched by a corresponding increase in revenues,•a significant increase in operating expenses,  •a reduction in our available credit under our credit facilities, or•general economic or national events. If we do not maintain sufficient liquidity, our ability to meet our payment obligations to creditors or to borrow additional funds could become impaired.16Liens on our engines or aircraft could exceed the value of such assets, which could negatively affect our ability to repossess, lease or sell a particular engine or aircraft.Liens that secure the payment of repairers’ charges or other liens may, depending on the jurisdiction, attach to engines and aircraft. Engines also may be installed on airframes to which liens unrelated to the engines have attached. These liens may secure substantial sums that may, in certain jurisdictions or for certain types of liens, exceed the value of the particular engine or aircraft to which the liens have attached. In some jurisdictions, a lien may give the holder the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the engine or aircraft. Such liens may have priority over our interest as well as our creditors’ interest in the engines or aircraft. These liens and lien holders could impair our ability to repossess and lease or sell the engines or aircraft. We cannot give assurance that our lessees will comply with their obligations to discharge third-party liens on our assets. If they do not, we may, in the future, find it necessary to pay the claims secured by such liens to repossess such assets.In certain countries, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an addition to the aircraft and we may not be able to exercise our ownership rights over the engine. In certain jurisdictions, an engine affixed to an aircraft may become an addition to the aircraft such that the ownership rights of the owner of the aircraft supersede the ownership rights of the owner of the engine. If an aircraft is security for the owner’s obligations to a third-party, the security interest in the aircraft may supersede our rights as owner of the engine. Such a security interest could limit our ability to repossess an engine located in such a jurisdiction in the event of a lessee bankruptcy or lease default. We may suffer a loss if we are not able to repossess engines leased to lessees in these jurisdictions.Higher or volatile fuel prices could affect the profitability of the aviation industry and our lessees’ ability to meet their lease payment obligations to us. Historically, fuel prices have fluctuated widely depending primarily on international market conditions, geopolitical and environmental events and currency exchange rates. Factors such as natural disasters can also significantly affect fuel availability and prices. The cost of fuel represents a major expense to airlines that is not within their control, and significant increases in fuel costs or hedges that inaccurately assess the direction of fuel costs can materially and adversely affect their operating results. Due to the competitive nature of the aviation industry, operators may be unable to pass on increases in fuel prices to their customers by increasing fares in a manner that fully offsets the increased fuel costs they may incur. In addition, they may not be able to manage this risk by appropriately hedging their exposure to fuel price fluctuations. The profitability and liquidity of those airlines that do hedge their fuel costs can also be adversely affected by swift movements in fuel prices if such airlines are required to post cash collateral under hedge agreements. Therefore, if for any reason fuel prices return to historically high levels or show significant volatility, our lessees are likely to incur higher costs or generate lower revenues, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.Interruptions in the capital markets could impair our lessees’ ability to finance their operations, which could prevent the lessees from complying with payment obligations to us. The global financial markets can be highly volatile and the availability of credit from financial markets and financial institutions can vary substantially depending on developments in the global financial markets. Our lessees depend on banks and the capital markets to provide working capital and to refinance existing indebtedness. To the extent such funding is unavailable, or available only on unfavorable terms, and to the extent financial markets do not provide equity financing as an alternative, our lessees’ operations and operating results may be materially and adversely affected and they may not comply with their respective payment obligations to us.Our lessees may fail to adequately insure our aircraft or engines which could subject us to additional costs. While an aircraft or engine is on lease, we do not directly control its operation. Nevertheless, because we hold title to the aircraft or engine, we could, in certain jurisdictions, be held liable for losses resulting from its operation. At a minimum, we may be required to expend resources in our defense. We require our lessees to obtain specified levels of insurance and indemnify us for, and insure against, such operational liabilities. However, some lessees may fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage during a lease term, which, although constituting a breach of the lease, would require us to take some corrective action, such as terminating the lease or securing insurance for the aircraft or engines. Therefore, our lessees’ insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims that could be asserted against us arising from the operation of our aircraft or engines. Inadequate insurance coverage or default by lessees in fulfilling their indemnification or insurance obligations to us will reduce the insurance proceeds that we would otherwise be entitled to receive in the event we are sued and are required to make payments to claimants. Moreover, our lessees’ insurance coverage is dependent on the financial condition of insurance companies and their ability to pay claims. A reduction in insurance proceeds otherwise payable to us as a result of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results.If our lessees fail to cooperate in returning our aircraft or engines following lease terminations, we may encounter obstacles and are likely to incur significant costs and expenses conducting repossessions. 17Our legal rights and the relative difficulty of repossession vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction in which an aircraft or engines are located. We may need to obtain a court order or consents for de-registration or re-export, a process that can differ substantially from county to country. When a defaulting lessee is in bankruptcy, protective administration, insolvency or similar proceedings, additional limitations may also apply. For example, certain jurisdictions give rights to the trustee in bankruptcy or a similar officer to assume or reject the lease, to assign it to a third party, or to entitle the lessee or another third party to retain possession of the aircraft or engines without paying lease rentals or performing all or some of the obligations under the relevant lease. Certain of our lessees are partially or wholly owned by government-related entities, which can further complicate our efforts to repossess our aircraft or engines in that government’s jurisdiction. If we encounter any of these difficulties, we may be delayed in, or prevented from, enforcing certain of our rights under a lease and in re-leasing the affected aircraft or engines.When conducting a repossession, we are likely to incur significant costs and expenses that are unlikely to be recouped. These include legal and other expenses related to legal proceedings, including the cost of posting security bonds or letters of credit necessary to effect repossession of the aircraft or engines, particularly if the lessee is contesting the proceedings or is in bankruptcy. We must absorb the cost of lost revenue for the time the aircraft or engines are off-lease. We may incur substantial maintenance, refurbishment or repair costs that a defaulting lessee has failed to pay and are necessary to put the aircraft or engines in suitable condition for re-lease or sale. We may also incur significant costs in retrieving or recreating aircraft records required for registration of the aircraft and in obtaining the certificate of airworthiness for an aircraft. It may be necessary to pay to discharge liens or pay taxes and other governmental charges on the aircraft to obtain clear possession and to remarket the aircraft effectively, including, in some cases, liens that the lessee may have incurred in connection with the operation of its other aircraft. We may also incur other costs in connection with the physical possession of the aircraft or engines.If our lessees fail to discharge aircraft liens for which they are responsible, we may be obligated to pay to discharge the liens. In the normal course of their businesses, our lessees are likely to incur aircraft and engine liens that secure the payment of airport fees and taxes, custom duties, Eurocontrol and other air navigation charges, landing charges, crew wages, and other liens that may attach to our aircraft. Aircraft may also be subject to mechanic’s liens as a result of routine maintenance performed by third parties on behalf of our customers. Some of these liens can secure substantial sums, and if they attach to entire fleets of aircraft, as permitted for certain kinds of liens, they may exceed the value of the aircraft itself. Although the financial obligations relating to these liens are the contractual responsibility of our lessees, if they fail to fulfill their obligations, the liens may ultimately become our financial responsibility. Until they are discharged, these liens could impair our ability to repossess, re-lease or sell our aircraft or engines. In some jurisdictions, aircraft and engine liens may give the holder thereof the right to detain or, in limited cases, sell or cause the forfeiture of the aircraft. If we are obliged to pay a large amount to discharge a lien, or if we are unable take possession of our aircraft subject to a lien in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could materially and adversely affect our financial results.If our lessees encounter financial difficulties and we restructure or terminate our leases, we are likely to obtain less favorable lease terms. If a lessee delays, reduces, or fails to make rental payments when due, or has advised us that it will do so in the future, we may elect or be required to restructure or terminate the lease. A restructured lease will likely contain terms that are less favorable to us. If we are unable to agree on a restructuring and we terminate the lease, we may not receive all or any payments still outstanding, and we may be unable to re-lease the aircraft or engines promptly and at favorable rates, if at all.Compliance with the regulatory requirements imposed on us as a public company results in significant costs that may have an adverse effect on our results.As a public company, we are subject to various regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Compliance with these regulations results in significant additional costs to us both directly, through increased audit and consulting fees, and indirectly, through the time required by our limited resources to address such regulations.Withdrawal, suspension or revocation of governmental authorizations or approvals could negatively affect our business.We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business. Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and operation of aircraft operated in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, such as the EASA in Europe, regulate aircraft operated in those countries. With the aircraft, engines and related parts that we purchase, lease and sell to our customers, we include documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. With respect to a particular engine or engine component, we utilize FAA and/or EASA certified repair stations to repair and certify engines and components to ensure marketability. The revocation or suspension of 18any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New and more stringent government regulations, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries require approval or licensing from the U.S. government. Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.A small number of stockholders has the ability to control the Company.We have a very concentrated stockholder base. As of March 31, 2020, our three largest stockholders beneficially owned or had the ability to direct the voting of shares of our common stock representing approximately 55% of the outstanding shares. As a result, these stockholders have the power to determine the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our board of directors. In addition, future sales by these stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the potential for such sales, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.Our business might suffer if we were to lose the services of certain key employees. Our business operations depend upon our key employees, including our executive officers. Loss of any of these employees, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our business as our key employees have knowledge of our industry and customers that would be difficult to replace. To service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available. Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, will depend largely upon our future operating performance. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on our maintaining specified financial ratios and satisfying financial condition tests and other covenants in the agreements governing our debt. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available in amounts sufficient to pay our debt and to satisfy our other liquidity needs.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to seek alternatives.If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and aircraft or engine purchases, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and might require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or to meet our aircraft or engine purchase commitments as they come due.Strategic ventures may increase risks applicable to our operations.We may enter into strategic ventures that pose risks, including a lack of complete control over the enterprise, and other potential unforeseen risks, any of which could adversely impact our financial results. We may occasionally enter into strategic ventures or investments with third parties in order to take advantage of favorable financing opportunities, to share capital or operating risk, or to earn aircraft management fees. These strategic ventures and investments may subject us to various risks, including those arising from our possessing limited decision-making rights in the enterprise or over the related aircraft. If we were unable to resolve a dispute with a strategic partner who controls ultimate decision-making in such a venture or retains material managerial veto rights, we might reach an impasse which may lead to the liquidation of our investment at a time and in a manner that would result in our losing some or all of our original investment and/or the occurrence of other losses, which could adversely impact our financial results.Our policies and procedures may not be effective in ensuring compliance with applicable law.Our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations, and, as a result we may be subject to related governmental investigations. We could become subject to various governmental investigations, audits and inquiries, both formal and informal. Such investigations, regardless of their outcome, could be costly, divert management attention, and damage our reputation. The unfavorable resolution of such investigations could result in criminal liability, fines, penalties or other monetary or non-monetary sanctions and could materially affect our business or results of operations.Despite our substantial indebtedness, we might incur significantly more debt, and cash may not be available to meet our financial obligations when due or enable us to capitalize on investment opportunities when they arise. 19We employ debt and other forms of leverage in the ordinary course of business to enhance returns to our investors and finance our operations, and despite our current indebtedness levels, we expect to incur additional debt in the future to finance our operations, including purchasing aircraft and engines and meeting our contractual obligations as the agreements relating to our debt, including our indentures, term loan facilities, revolving credit facilities, and other financings do not entirely prohibit us from incurring additional debt. We also enter into financing commitments in the normal course of business, which we may be required to fund. If we are required to fund these commitments and are unable to do so, we could be liable for damages pursued against us or a loss of opportunity through default under contracts that are otherwise to our benefit could occur.  We are therefore subject to the risks associated with debt financing and refinancing, including but not limited to the following: (i) our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; (ii) payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pay operating expenses and dividends; (iii) if we are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at high interest rates or on other unfavorable terms, we may have difficulty completing acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case; (iv) we may not be able to refinance indebtedness at maturity due to company and market factors such as the estimated cash flow produced by our assets, the value of our assets, liquidity in the debt markets, and/or financial, competitive, business and other factors; and (v) if we are able to refinance our indebtedness, the terms of a refinancing may not be as favorable as the original terms for such indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we may need to utilize available liquidity, which would reduce our ability to pursue new investment opportunities, dispose of one or more of our assets on disadvantageous terms, or raise equity, causing dilution to existing stockholders.The terms of our various credit agreements and other financing documents also require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios, adequate insurance coverage and certain credit ratings. These covenants may limit our flexibility in conducting our operations and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, even if we have satisfied and continue to satisfy our payment obligations. Regulatory changes may also result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to credit.A large proportion of our capital is invested in physical assets and securities that can be hard to sell, especially if market conditions are poor. Because our investment strategy can involve public company securities, we may be restricted in our ability to effect sales during certain time periods. A lack of liquidity could limit our ability to vary our portfolio or assets promptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. Additionally, if financial or operating difficulties of other competitors result in distress sales, such sales could depress asset values in the markets in which we operate. The restrictions inherent in owning physical assets could reduce our ability to respond to changes in market conditions and could adversely affect the performance of our investments, our financial condition and results of operations. Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of illiquid or non-public investments, the fair values of such investments do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained when such investments are realized. Deficiencies in our public company financial reporting and disclosures could adversely impact our reputation. As we expand the size and scope of our business, there is a greater susceptibility that our financial reporting and other public disclosure documents may contain material misstatements and that the controls we maintain to attempt to ensure the complete accuracy of our public disclosures may fail to operate as intended. The occurrence of such events could adversely impact our reputation and financial condition. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to give our stakeholders assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). However, the process for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error. Our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial disclosures on a timely basis, or at all. Some of these processes may be new for certain subsidiaries in our structure, and in the case of acquisitions, may take time to be fully implemented. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under U.S. securities laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. Our policies and procedures governing disclosures may not ensure that all material information regarding us is disclosed in a proper and timely fashion or that we will be successful in preventing the disclosure of material information to a single person or a limited group of people before such information is generally disseminated"
2,AIRT,AIR T INC,2018-06-29,"     Risk Factors
. The following risk factors, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be considered by investors in connection with any investment in the Company’s common stock. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Significant Customers We are significantly dependent on our contractual relationship with FedEx Corporation, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, 38% of our consolidated operating revenues, and 100% of the operating revenues for our overnight air cargo segment, arose from services we provided to FedEx. Our current agreements may be terminated by FedEx upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, FedEx may terminate the dry-lease agreement with MAC or CSA upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes its only customer, or it employs less than six employees. As of the date of this report, FedEx would be permitted to terminate each of the new dry-lease agreements under this provision. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. The loss of these contracts with FedEx would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Changes in our agreements with FedEx subject us to greater operating risks. On June 1, 2015, MAC and CSA entered into new dry-lease agreements with FedEx with terms different from our prior dry-lease service contracts.  The dry-lease agreements provide for the lease of specified aircraft by us in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased, which monthly rent was increased from the prior dry-lease service contracts to reflect an estimate of a fair market rental rate. The dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of our costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Unlike the prior dry-lease contracts, under the new dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by us in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are to be borne solely by us.  12  The dry-lease agreements with FedEx provide for the lease of specified aircraft by us in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased. The dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of our costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Certain operational costs incurred by us in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are borne solely by us. The current dry-lease agreements provide for the payment by FedEx to us of a monthly administrative fee based on the number and type of aircraft leased and routes operated. The amount of the monthly administrative fee under the current dry-lease agreements is greater than under the prior dry-lease service contracts with FedEx, in part to reflect the greater monthly lease payment per aircraft and that certain operational costs are to be borne by MAC and CSA and not reimbursed.  Accordingly, as a result in the change in our arrangements with FedEx as reflected in the new dry-lease agreements, we are subject to the risk of rising operational costs that are not reimbursed to us at cost and may be in excess of the allocable portion of the increased administrative fee, which could adversely affect results of operations.  In addition, since MAC and CSA entered into the new dry-lease agreements in 2015, they have periodically entered into amendments to the agreements with FedEx that have adjusted the administrative fees payable under these agreements. These adjustments, which have generally been made on an annual basis, have resulted in annual period-to-period volatility in MAC and CSA’s profitability. Although MAC and CSA have entered into such an amendment effective as of June 1, 2017 which positively affected MAC and CSA’s profitability compared to results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 as discussed within Management’s Discussion and Analysis, future amendments may reduce the administrative fees and accordingly negatively affect MAC and CSA’s profitability. Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations.  These risks are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Risk Factors
” in FedEx Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017.  These risks include but are not limited to the following:  ●Economic conditions in the global markets in which it operates; ●Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand; ●Potential disruption to the Internet and FedEx’s technology infrastructure, including customer websites, including cyberattacks; ●The price and availability of fuel; ●Its ability to manage its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes; ●Intense competition from other providers of transportation and business services; ●Changes in governmental regulations that may affect its business; ●Its ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and realize the expected benefits; ●Its ability to maintain good relationships with its employees and prevent attempts by labor organizations to organize groups of its employees; ●The continued classification of owner-operators in its ground delivery business as independent contractors rather than as employees; ●The impact of the United Kingdom’s planned withdrawal from the European Union; ●The impact of terrorist activities including the imposition of stricter governmental security requirements; ●Regulatory actions affecting global aviation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets; ●Global climate change or legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; ●Localized natural or man-made disasters in key locations, including its Memphis, Tennessee super-hub; ●Disruptions or modifications in service by the United States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx; and ●Widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis. A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly and FedEx may reduce the number of aircraft we lease and operate upon 10 days’ written notice.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction in any period could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period.  13  Our ground support services segment has been dependent upon the revenues from two significant customers, the loss of which could materially impact the segment’s results. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, approximately 47% of GAS’s revenues were derived from services under contracts with two customers.  The loss of these customers, or a major decline in business activity with these customers, could materially adversely impact the results of the segment. Other Business Risks Our revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations.  The maintenance revenues of our overnight air cargo segment are affected based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our overnight air cargo operations which is affected by the level of usage of the aircraft.  Accordingly, the maintenance revenues of our overnight air cargo segment fluctuate from period to period.  In addition, if the number of aircraft operated for FedEx were to decrease, we would likely experience fewer maintenance hours and consequently, less maintenance revenue. Incidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period. Incidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell.  While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate. The suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our overnight air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA.  The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness.  The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations.  Our overnight air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications.  Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner.  Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.  Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions. Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units. Our results of operations may be affected by the value of securities we hold for investment and we may be unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner at full value. We invest a significant portion of our capital not needed for operations in marketable securities, including equity securities of publicly traded companies. At March 31, 2018, the fair value of these marketable securities was approximately $2.6 million. Our results of operations may be affected by gains or losses recognized upon the sale of these investments or by losses recognized upon the determination that any such investment has become impaired or suffered an “other-than-temporary” impairment. At March 31, 2018, we had gross unrealized gains associated with marketable securities aggregating $36,000 and gross unrealized losses aggregating $69,000. 14  Any investment with a fair value of less than its cost basis is assessed for possible “other-than-temporary” impairment regularly and at each reporting date. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable equity securities are recognized in the consolidated statement of income (loss). On the basis of its June 30, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 assessments, the Company concluded that it had suffered an “other-than-temporary” impairment in its investment in the common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISIG) (“Insignia”). Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company’s cost basis in the Insignia investment was lowered to $3,604,000 at June 30, 2016, to $2,643,000 at March 31, 2017 and to $1,724,000 at June 30, 2017 to reflect the impairment charges. On the basis of its December 31, 2017 “other-than-temporary” impairment assessment, the Company concluded that it had suffered an other-than-temporary impairment in its investment in the common stock of Oxbridge Re Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: OXBR) (Oxbridge). The Company’s cost basis in its Oxbridge investment was lowered from $1,516,000 to $727,000 at December 31, 2017 which represents an other-than temporary impairment of $789,000. In addition, from time to time we may hold positions in marketable securities that under then-current market conditions we may be unable to liquidate in a timely manner at full value. Our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions. Our business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Although we have adopted certain measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks, including rising healthcare costs, changes in environmental laws and other unforeseen business interruptions. Our business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks. For example, medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase. Initiatives to address these costs, such as consumer driven health plan packages, may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed. Failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees. Additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware corporation law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, among other things regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders’ meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval. "

These adjustments, which have generally been made on an annual basis, have resulted in annual period-to-period volatility in MAC and CSA’s profitability. Although MAC and CSA have entered into such an amendment effective as of June 1, 2017 which is expected to positively affect MAC and CSA’s profitability compared to results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, future amendments may reduce the administrative fees and accordingly negatively affect MAC and CSA’s profitability. Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations.  These risks are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Risk Factors

and ●Widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis. A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly and FedEx may reduce the number of aircraft we lease and operate upon 10 days’ written notice.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction in any period could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period.   13  Our ground support services segment has been dependent upon the revenues from two significant customers, the loss of which could materially impact the segment’s results. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, approximately 42% of GAS’s revenues were derived from services under contracts with two customers.  The loss of these customers, or a major decline in business activity with these customers, could materially adversely impact the results of the segment. Other Business Risks Our revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations.  The maintenance revenues of our overnight air cargo segment are affected based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our overnight air cargo operations which is affected by the level of usage of the aircraft.  Accordingly, the maintenance revenues of our overnight air cargo segment fluctuate from period to period.  In addition, if the number of aircraft operated for FedEx were to decrease, we would likely experience fewer maintenance hours and consequently, less maintenance revenue. Incidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period. Incidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell.  While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate, and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate. The suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our overnight air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA.  The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness.  The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations.  Our overnight air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications.  Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner.  Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.   Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions. Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units. Our results of operations may be affected by the value of securities we hold for investment and we may be unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner at full value. We invest a significant portion of our capital not needed for operations in marketable securities, including equity securities of publicly traded companies. At March 31, 2017, the fair value of these marketable securities was approximately $4.6 million, of which $2.5 million represents the fair value of shares of common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc. Our results of operations may be affected by gains or losses recognized upon the sale of these investments or by losses recognized upon the determination that any such investment has become impaired or suffered an “other-than-temporary” impairment. At March 31, 2017, we had gross unrealized gains associated with marketable securities aggregating $279,000 and gross unrealized losses aggregating $2,771,000.  14  Any investment with a fair value of less than its cost basis is assessed for possible “other-than-temporary” impairment regularly and at each reporting date. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable equity securities are recognized in the consolidated statement of income (loss). On the basis of its June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2017 assessments, the Company concluded that it had suffered an “other-than-temporary” impairment in its investment in the common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc. (“Insignia”). In reaching this conclusion, management gave significant weight to the fact that, as of June 30, 2016 and as of March 31, 2017, the Company’s investment in Insignia had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for well over one year and that the magnitude of the unrealized loss had increased sharply during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and the quarter ended March 31, 2017. While management believed that it was reasonably possible that the unrealized loss at March 31, 2017 would reverse prior to the Company’s divestment of the security, management concluded that the weight of the evidence warranted the “other-than-temporary” impairment. Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company’s cost basis in the Insignia investment was lowered to $3,604,000 at June 30, 2016 and to $2,643,000 at March 31, 2017 to reflect the impairment charge.  On the basis of its March 31, 2017 assessment, the Company concluded that it had suffered an additional “other-than-temporary” impairment in its investment in marketable securities for approximately $112,000. In addition, from time to time we may hold positions in marketable securities that under then-current market conditions we may be unable to liquidate in a timely manner at full value. For example, at May 31, 2017, we held approximately 1.65 million shares of common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc., representing approximately 14% of the outstanding shares and approximately 110 times the average daily trading volume for such shares for the preceding 50 days. In the event that we are unable to liquidate an investment at full value our gain from the sale of that investment may be reduced or our loss from the sale of that investment may be increased.  Our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions. Our business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Although we have adopted certain measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks, including rising healthcare costs, changes in environmental laws and other unforeseen business interruptions. Our business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks. For example, medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase. Initiatives to address these costs, such as consumer driven health plan packages, may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed. Failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees. Additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have identified material weaknesses related to our internal controls and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. As described elsewhere in Part II, Item 9A of this report, we have identified a number of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which existed at March 31, 2017. In addition, we have previously identified material weaknesses with respect to our accounting for our investments in Delphax. As a result of an error in the accounting for the attribution of the net income or loss of Delphax to non-controlling interests, we restated our consolidated financial statements at and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, and the selected quarterly financial data for the final two quarters in the fiscal year then ended, as well as our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2015, the three months ended June 30, 2016, the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and selected consolidated balance sheet data at December 31, 2015, March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016. 15  Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware corporation law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, among other things regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders’ meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval. "
11,AIRT,AIR T INC,2016-06-29,"     Risk Factors
. The following risk factors, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be considered by investors in connection with any investment in the Company’s common stock. As used in this Item, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Company and its subsidiaries. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Significant Customers We are significantly dependent on our contractual relationship with FedEx Corporation, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, 46% of our consolidated operating revenues, and 100% of the operating revenues for our overnight air cargo segment, arose from services we provided to FedEx. Our current agreements may be terminated by FedEx upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, FedEx may terminate the dry-lease agreement with MAC or CSA upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes its only customer, or it employs less than six employees. As of the date of this report, FedEx would have been permitted to terminate each of the new dry-lease agreements under this provision. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. The loss of these contracts with FedEx would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Recent changes in our agreements with FedEx subject us to greater operating risks. On June 1, 2015, MAC and CSA entered into new dry-lease agreements with FedEx with terms different from our prior dry-lease service contracts.  The new dry-lease agreements provide for the lease of specified aircraft by us in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased, which monthly rent was increased from the prior dry-lease service contracts to reflect an estimate of a fair market rental rate.  The new dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of our costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs.  Unlike the prior dry-lease contracts, under the new dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by us in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are to be borne solely by us.  The new dry-lease agreements provide for the payment by FedEx to us of a monthly administrative fee based on the number and type of aircraft leased and routes operated.  The amount of the monthly administrative fee under the new dry-lease agreements is greater than under the prior dry-lease service contracts with FedEx, in part to reflect the greater monthly lease payment per aircraft and that certain operational costs are to be borne by MAC and CSA and not reimbursed.  Accordingly, as a result in the change in our arrangements with FedEx as reflected in the new dry-lease agreements, we are subject to the risk of rising operational costs that are no longer reimbursed to us at cost and may be in excess of the allocable portion of the increased administrative fee, which could adversely affect results of operations.    9  Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations.  These risks are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Risk Factors
” in FedEx Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015.  These risks include but are not limited to the following:   ●Economic conditions in the global markets in which it operates; ●Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand; ●Potential disruption to the Internet and FedEx’s technology infrastructure, including customer websites; ●The price and availability of fuel; ●Its ability to manage its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes; ●Intense competition from other providers of transportation and business services; ●Its ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and realize the expected benefits; ●Its ability to maintain good relationships with its employees and prevent attempts by labor organizations to organize groups of its employees; ●The continued classification of owner-operators in its ground delivery business as independent contractors rather than as employees; ●Its ability to execute on its business realignment program to improve profitability; ●The impact of terrorist activities including the imposition of stricter governmental security requirements; ●Regulatory actions affecting global aviation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets; ●Global climate change or legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; ●Localized natural or man-made disasters in key locations, including its Memphis, Tennessee super-hub; ●Disruptions or modifications in service by the United States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx; and ●Widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis. A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly and FedEx may reduce the number of aircraft we lease and operate upon 10 days’ written notice.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction in any period could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period.   Our ground support services segment has been dependent upon the revenues from two significant customers, the loss of which could materially impact the segment’s results. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, approximately 48% of GAS’s revenues were derived from services under contracts with two customers.  The loss of these customers, or a major decline in business activity with these customers, could materially adversely impact the results of the segment.  10  Other Business Risks Unless Delphax obtains access to adequate sources of liquidity, it may be unable to adequately fund its operations or pay its debts as they come due and we may be unable to fully recover our investments in Delphax. As of March 31, 2016, Delphax maintained a debt facility consisting of a $7.0 million revolving senior secured credit facility, subject to a borrowing base of North American accounts receivable and inventory. Neither Air T nor any of its subsidiaries is a guarantor of Delphax’s obligations under its senior credit facility. The Delphax senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of its North American assets, expires in November 2018, prohibits payment of cash dividends by Delphax and is subject to certain financial covenants. As of March 31, 2016, Delphax had aggregate borrowings of $1,833,000 outstanding under its senior credit facility, with a borrowing base that would have permitted additional borrowings of approximately $800,000. Delphax has advised that at March 31, 2016 it was not in compliance with financial covenants under the agreement governing its senior credit facility. Due to Delphax’s non-compliance with financial covenants, the lender has the contractual right to cease permitting borrowings under the facility and to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility due and payable immediately. As of the date of this report the lender has neither made such declaration, nor waived its right to do so and Delphax has continued to make borrowings under the senior credit facility. As of the date of this report, Delphax has not regained compliance with these financial covenants. In the event that Delphax is denied access to additional borrowings under the senior credit facility, unless it obtains access to other adequate sources of liquidity, which may include cash from operations, Delphax may be unable to adequately fund its operations or pay its debts as they come due. Delphax has recently implemented cost-savings initiatives, including employee furloughs, to minimize ongoing cash needs.  In addition to the Shares of Delphax’s Series B Preferred Stock and the Warrant to acquire additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock, our investments in Delphax include a $2,500,000 Senior Subordinated Note issued by Delphax’s Canadian operating subsidiary and guaranteed by Delphax. An event of default will exist under the Senior Subordinated Note if Delphax’s non-compliance with financial covenants under its senior credit facility is not waived by its senior lender. Under the terms of a subordination agreement with the senior lender under Delphax’s revolving senior secured credit facility entered into at the time we made our investments in Delphax, our rights with respect to payment under and enforcement of the Senior Subordinated Note and enforcement of our related security interests are subordinated to the rights of the senior lender. Accordingly, in the event of a default under the Senior Subordinated Note, we may be limited in the actions we may take to enforce the Senior Subordinated Note or related security interests and we may be unable to collect in full on the Senior Subordinated Note or fully recover our other investments in Delphax. Our revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations.  The maintenance revenues of our overnight air cargo segment are affected based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our overnight air cargo operations which is affected by the level of usage of the aircraft.  Accordingly, the maintenance revenues of our overnight air cargo segment fluctuate from period to period.  In addition, if the number of aircraft operated for FedEx were to decrease, we would likely experience fewer maintenance hours and consequently, less maintenance revenue. Incidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period. Incidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell.  While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate, and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate. The suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our overnight air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA.  The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness.  The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations.  Our overnight air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications.  Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner.  Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.    11  Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions. Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units. Our results of operations may be affected by the value of securities we hold for investment and we may be unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner at full value. We invest a significant portion of our capital not needed for operations in marketable securities, including equity securities of publicly traded companies. At March 31, 2016, the fair value of these marketable securities was approximately $9.7 million, of which $4.7 million represents the fair value of shares of common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc. Our results of operations may be affected by gains or losses recognized upon the sale of these investments or by losses recognized upon the determination that any such investment has become impaired or suffered an other than temporary impairment. At March 31, 2016, we had gross unrealized gains associated with marketable securities aggregating $422,000 and gross unrealized losses aggregating $557,000. In addition, from time to time we may hold positions in marketable securities that under then-current market conditions we may be unable to liquidate in a timely manner at full value. For example, at May 31, 2016, we held approximately 1.65 million shares of common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc., representing approximately 14.25% of the outstanding shares and approximately 225 times the average daily trading volume for such shares for the preceding three months. In the event that we are unable to liquidate an investment at full value our gain from the sale of that investment may be reduced or our loss from the sale of that investment may be increased.  Our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions. Our business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Although we have adopted certain measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks, including rising healthcare costs, changes in environmental laws and other unforeseen business interruptions. Our business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks. For example, medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase. Initiatives to address these costs, such as consumer driven health plan packages, may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed. Failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees. Additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our stockholder rights plan and provisions of Delaware corporation law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, among other things regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders’ meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval. Our stockholder rights plan also makes an acquisition of a controlling interest in the Company in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult.  12  "
1,AIRT,AIR T INC,2015-06-08,"Risk Factors
. The following risk factors, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be considered by investors in connection with any investment in the Company’s common stock. As used in this Item, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Company and its subsidiaries. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Significant Customers We are significantly dependent on our contractual relationship with FedEx Corporation, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, 45% of our consolidated operating revenues, and 100% of the operating revenues for our overnight air cargo segment, arose from services we provided to FedEx. Our current agreements may be terminated by FedEx upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, FedEx may terminate the dry-lease agreement with MAC or CSA upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes its only customer, or it employs less than six employees. As of the date of this report, FedEx would have been permitted to terminate each of the new dry-lease agreements under this provision. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. The loss of these contracts with FedEx would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Recent changes in our agreements with FedEx subject us to greater operating risks. On June 1, 2015, MAC and CSA entered into new dry-lease agreements with FedEx with terms different from our prior dry-lease service contracts.  The new dry-lease agreements provide for the lease of specified aircraft by us in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased, which monthly rent was increased from the prior dry-lease service contracts to reflect an estimate of a fair market rental rate.  The new dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of our costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs.  Unlike the prior dry-lease contracts, under the new dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by us in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are to be borne solely by us.  The new dry-lease agreements provide for the payment by FedEx to us of a monthly administrative fee based on the number and type of aircraft leased and routes operated.  The amount of the monthly administrative fee under the new dry-lease agreements is greater than under the prior dry-lease service contracts with FedEx, in part to reflect the greater monthly lease payment per aircraft and that certain operational costs are to be borne by MAC and CSA and not reimbursed.  Accordingly, as a result in the change in our arrangements with FedEx as reflected in the new dry-lease agreements, we are subject to the risk of rising operational costs that are no longer reimbursed to us at cost and may be in excess of the allocable portion of the increased administrative fee, which could adversely affect results of operations.   Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. These risks are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Risk Factors
” in FedEx Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. These risks include but are not limited to the following:   ●Economic conditions in the global markets in which it operates; ●Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand; ●Potential disruption to the Internet and FedEx’s technology infrastructure, including customer websites; ●The price and availability of fuel; ●Its ability to manage its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes; ●Intense competition from other providers of transportation and business services; ●Its ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and realize the expected benefits; ●Its ability to maintain good relationships with its employees and prevent attempts by labor organizations to organize groups of its employees; ●Its ability to execute on its business realignment program to improve profitability; ●The impact of terrorist activities including the imposition of stricter governmental security requirements; ●Regulatory actions affecting global aviation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets; ●Global climate change or legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; ●Localized natural or man-made disasters in key locations, including its Memphis, Tennessee super-hub; ●Disruptions or modifications in service by the Unites States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx; and ●Widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis.   8  A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly and FedEx may reduce the number of aircraft we lease and operate upon 10 days’ notice. Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx. Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. A temporary reduction in any period could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period.  Our ground support services segment has been dependent upon the revenues from two significant customers, the loss of which could materially impact the segment’s results. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, approximately 51% of GAS’s revenues were derived from services under contracts with two customers. The contract with one of these was renewed in 2014. The loss of these customers, or a major decline in business activity with these customers, could materially adversely impact the results of the segment. Other Business Risks Our revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations.  Our maintenance revenues are affected based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our overnight air cargo operations which is affected by the level of usage of the aircraft. Accordingly, our maintenance revenues fluctuate from period to period. In addition, if the number of aircraft operated for FedEx were to decrease, we would likely experience fewer maintenance hours and consequently, less maintenance revenue. Incidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period. Incidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell. While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate, and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate. The suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our overnight air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness. The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations. Our overnight air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications. Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner. Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial position. The suspension or revocation of all of these certifications would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.   9  Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions. Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units. Our results of operations may be affected by the value of securities we hold for investment and we may be unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner at full value. We invest a significant portion of our capital not needed for operations in marketable securities, including equity securities of publicly traded companies. At March 31, 2015, the fair value of these marketable securities was approximately $5.3 million. Our results of operations may be affected by gain or loss recognized upon the sale of these investments or upon the determination that any such investment has become impaired. At March 31, 2015, we had gross unrealized gains associated with marketable securities aggregating $0 and gross unrealized losses aggregating $211,000. In addition, from time to time we may hold positions in marketable securities that under then-current market conditions we may be unable to liquidate in a timely manner at full value. For example, at May 31, 2015, we held approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc., representing approximately 13.1% of the outstanding shares and approximately 17,200 times the average daily trading volume for such shares for the preceding three months. In the event that we are unable to liquidate an investment at full value our gain from the sale of that investment may be reduced or our loss from the sale of that investment may be increased.  Our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions. Our business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Although we have adopted certain measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks, including rising healthcare costs, changes in environmental laws and other unforeseen business interruptions. Our business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks. For example, medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase. Initiatives to address these costs, such as consumer driven health plan packages, may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed. Failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees. Additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our stockholder rights plan and provisions of Delaware corporation law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, among other things regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders’ meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval. Our stockholder rights plan also makes an acquisition of a controlling interest in the Company in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult.   10  "

” in FedEx Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013.  These risks include but are not limited to the following: ·  Economic conditions in the global markets in which it operates;·  Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand;·  Potential disruption to the Internet and FedEx’s technology infrastructure, including customer websites;·  The price and availability of fuel;·  Its ability to manage its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes;·  Intense competition from other providers of transportation and business services;·  Its ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and realize the expected benefits;·  Its ability to maintain good relationships with its employees and prevent attempts by labor organizations to organize groups of its employees;·  Its ability to execute on its business realignment program to improve profitability;·  The impact of terrorist activities including the imposition of stricter governmental security requirements;·  Regulatory actions affecting global aviation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets;·  Global climate change or legal, regulatory or market responses to such change;·  Localized natural or man-made disasters in key locations, including its Memphis, Tennessee super-hub;·  Disruptions or modifications in service by the Unites States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx; and·  Widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis.  7    A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period. Our ground support services segment has been dependent upon the revenues from two significant customers, the loss of which could materially impact the segment’s results. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, approximately 52% of GAS’s revenues were derived from services under contracts with two customers.  The contract with one of these customers is subject to renewal in July 2014. The loss of these customers, or a major decline in business activity with these customers, could materially adversely impact the results of the segment. Other Business Risks Our revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations. Our maintenance revenues are affected based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our overnight air cargo operations which is affected by the level of usage of the aircraft.  Accordingly, our maintenance revenues fluctuate from period to period.  In addition, if the number of aircraft operated for FedEx were to decrease, we would likely experience fewer maintenance hours and consequently, less maintenance revenue. Incidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period. Incidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell.  While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate, and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate. The suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our overnight air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA.  The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness.  The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations.  Our overnight air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications.  Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner.  Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial position.  The suspension or revocation of all of these certifications would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 8     Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions. Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft.  The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather.  Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions.  As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control.  Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware corporation law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management.

” in FedEx Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2012 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended February 28, 2013.  These risks include but are not limited to the following: ·  Economic conditions in the global markets in which it operates;·  Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand;·  Potential disruption to the Internet and FedEx’s technology infrastructure, including its website;·  The price and availability of fuel;·  Its ability to manage its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes;·  Intense competition from other providers of transportation services;·  Its ability to maintain good relationships with its employees and prevent attempts by labor organizations to organize groups of its employees;·  The impact of any international conflicts or terrorist activities on the United States and global economies in general, the transportation industry or it in particular, and what effects these events will have on the cost and demand for its services;·  Increased pilot safety requirements;·  Regulatory actions affecting global aviation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets;·  Global climate change or legal, regulatory or market responses to such change;·  Localized natural or man-made disasters in key locations, including its Memphis, Tennessee super-hub;·  Disruptions or modifications in service by the Unites States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx; and·  Widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis.  7        A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period.  Our agreements with the United States Air Force are for one year with limited additional one-year extension options. In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, approximately 15% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues arose from sales of deicing and other equipment to the USAF under two long-term contracts.  GGS currently supplies deicing equipment to the USAF under a contract awarded in 2009.  The contract award was for one year with four additional one-year extension options that may be exercised by the USAF.  In June 2012, the third option period under the contract was exercised, extending the contract to July 2013.  During the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, GGS received orders for $5.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively, under this new contract.In September 2010, GGS was awarded a contract to supply flight-line tow tractors to the USAF.  The contract award is for one year commencing September 28, 2010 with four additional one-year extension options that may be exercised by the USAF.  In August 2012, the second option period under the contract was exercised, extending the contract to September 2013.  During the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, GGS received orders for $3.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively, under this contract.In the event that the United States Air Force does not award the remaining extension options under these contracts or does not renew these contracts, our revenues from sales of ground support equipment are likely to decrease unless we are successful in obtaining customer orders from other sources that can replace the equipment sold to the USAF.  In addition, sales of deicing and other equipment to the USAF have, in the past, enabled GGS to ameliorate the seasonality of our ground support equipment business.  Thus, if the extension options with the USAF are not renewed or if ordering levels under the contracts are low, seasonal patterns for this business may develop, with revenues and operating income for the segment being lower in the first and fourth fiscal quarters.  Trends toward reduction in military spending may adversely affect the volume of orders under our USAF contracts. Our contract awards with the USAF do not obligate the USAF to purchase any set or minimum number of deicing units or flight-line tow tractors.  The value of these contracts, as well as the number of units to be delivered, depends on the annual requirements and available funding of the USAF.  Trends toward reduced military spending, including cuts to military budgets under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (commonly referred to as sequestration), may adversely affect the volume of orders under those contracts.                 8      The revenues of each of the other segments of our business have been dependent on significant customers of that segment, the loss of which could materially impact the segment’s results. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, approximately 55% of GAS’s revenue was derived from services under multiple contracts with two customers and approximately 38% of GGS’s revenue arose from sales to the United States Air Force.  The loss of any of these customers, or a major decline in business activity with these customers, could materially adversely impact the results of the relevant business segment. Other Business Risks Our revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations. Our maintenance revenues are affected based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our overnight air cargo operations which is affected by the level of usage of the aircraft.  Accordingly, our maintenance revenues fluctuate from period to period.  In addition, if the number of aircraft operated for FedEx were to decrease, we would likely experience fewer maintenance hours and consequently, less maintenance revenue. Incidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period. Incidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell.  While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate, and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate. The suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our overnight air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA.  The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness.  The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations.  Our overnight air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications.  Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner.  Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial position.  The suspension or revocation of all of these certifications would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions. Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft.  The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather.  Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions.  As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control.  Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our stockholder rights plan and provisions of Delaware corporation law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of

June 2011, the second option period under the contract was exercised, extending the contract to July 2012.  During the year ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, GGS received orders for $3.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively, under this new contract.In September 2010, GGS was awarded a contract to supply flight line tow tractors to the USAF.  The contract award is for one year commencing September 28, 2010 with four additional one-year extension options that may be exercised by the USAF.  In September 2011, the first option period under the contract was exercised, extending the contract to September 2012.  The value of the contract, as well as the number of units to be delivered, will be determined based upon annual requirements and available funding of the USAF.  In September 2011, GGS received a $5.1 million purchase order from the USAF for the delivery of flight line tow tractors, to be delivered between April and September 2012.In the event that the United States Air Force does not award the remaining extension options under these contracts, our revenues from sales of ground support equipment are likely to decrease unless we are successful in obtaining customer orders from other sources that can replace the equipment sold to the USAF.  In addition, sales of deicing and other equipment to the USAF have, in the past, enabled GGS to ameliorate the seasonality of our ground

and·  Adverse weather conditions or natural disasters. A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period. Our agreement with the United States Air Force is for one year with limited additional one-year extension options. In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, approximately 1% and 21%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues arose from sales of deicing equipment to the USAF under a long-term contract.  This initial four-year contract, awarded in 1999, was extended for two additional three-year periods, and expired in June 2009.  On July 15, 2009, the Company announced that GGS had been awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF.  The contract award was for one year with four additional one-year extension options that may be exercised by the USAF.  In June 2010, the first option period under the contract was exercised, extending the contract to July 2011.  During the year ended March 31, 2010, GGS received no orders under this new contract, with revenues from sales to the USAF arising under the prior contract.  However, during the year ended March 31, 2011, GGS received orders for $4.9 million under this new contract.  In the event that the United States Air Force does not award the remaining extension options under this contract, our revenues from sales of ground support equipment are likely to decrease unless we are successful in obtaining customer orders from other sources that can replace the equipment sold to the USAF.  In addition, sales of deicing equipment to the USAF have enabled GGS to ameliorate the seasonality of our ground support equipment business.  Thus, if the extension options with the USAF are not renewed or if ordering levels under the contract are low; seasonal patterns for this business may re-emerge.Other Business Risks Our revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations. Our maintenance revenues fluctuate based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our overnight air cargo operations.  If the number of aircraft operated for FedEx were to decrease, we would likely experience fewer maintenance hours and consequently, less maintenance revenue. Incidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period. Incidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell.  While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate, and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate. The suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our overnight air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA.  The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness.  The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations.  Our overnight air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications.  Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner.  Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial position.  The suspension or revocation of all of these certifications would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.             8  Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions. Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft.  The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather.  Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. "

” in FedEx Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009.  These risks include: ·  Economic conditions in the global markets in which it operates;·  Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand;·  Potential changes in labor laws that could make it easier for labor organizations to organize groups of their employees;·  Heavy reliance upon technology, including the internet;·  The price and availability of fuel;·  Intense competition from other providers of transportation services, especially during the current global recession;·  The impact of any international conflicts or terrorist activities on the United States and global economies in general, the transportation industry in particular, and what effects these events will have on the cost and demand for its services;·  Any impacts on its business resulting from new domestic or international government laws and regulation, including regulatory actions affecting aviation rights, security requirements, tax, accounting, environmental or labor rules;·  Widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis; and·  Adverse weather conditions or natural disasters. A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly.  In the past year, the number of aircraft we operate for FedEx has decreased from 82 to 80 aircraft, due to a variety of factors beyond our Company’s control.  Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx.  Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  A temporary reduction could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period.       7  Our agreement with the United States Air Force is for one year with four additional one-year extension options.In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 21% and 23%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues arose from sales of deicing equipment to the United States Air Force under a long-term contract.  This initial four-year contract, awarded in 1999, was extended for two additional three-year periods, and expired in June 2009.  On July 15, 2009, the Company announced that GGS had been awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the United States Air Force.  The contract award was for one year with four additional one-year extension options that may be exercised by the United States Air Force.  During the year ended March 31, 2010, GGS received no orders under this new contract.  However, in May and June 2010, GGS received orders for $4.6 million under this new contract.  In the event that the United States Air Force does not award the additional extension options or does not increase purchasing activity under this contract, our revenues from sales of ground support equipment are likely to decrease unless we are successful in obtaining customer orders from other sources that can replace the equipment sold to the Air Force.  In addition, sales of deicing equipment to the Air Force have enabled GGS to ameliorate the seasonality of our ground support equipment business.  Thus, if the extension options with the Air Force are not renewed and ordering levels do not increase; seasonal patterns for this business may re-emerge.Our Ground Support Equipment and Airport Facility Maintenance Services Segment is highly dependent on its contract with one major customer. A significant portion of GAS’s revenue, 64% in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, was derived from services under a contract with Delta Airlines.  The contract was originally signed with Northwest Airlines and expires in December 2010.  Northwest Airlines subsequently merged with Delta Airlines and GAS continues to operate under the contract.  We have recently submitted a bid to Delta to continue providing services at the majority of our existing locations as well as additional locations.  We are unable to determine at this time, what the results will be from this competitive bid process.  If we are unsuccessful in the bid process with Delta Airlines or are awarded a reduced number of locations serviced, it could materially adversely impact this business segment. Other Business Risks Our revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations. Our maintenance revenues fluctuate based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our air cargo operations.  If the number of aircraft operated for FedEx continues to decrease, we would likely experience fewer maintenance hours and consequently, less maintenance revenue. Incidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period. Incidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell.  While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate, and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate. The suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA.  The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness.  The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations.  Our air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications.  Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner.  Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial position.  The suspension or revocation of all of these certifications would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.         8  Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions. Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft.  The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather.  Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. "
