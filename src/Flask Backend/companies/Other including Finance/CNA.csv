12,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2024-02-06,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. We have described below material risks that we face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be material that may also affect our business. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.Insurance RisksIf we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date.  The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain.  These factors can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events.  Key variables include frequency of claims, claim severity, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, economic, social and medical inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as long-term care, workers' compensation, general liability and professional liability, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled.  The impact of changes in economic and social inflation, and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.  Certain risks and uncertainties associated with our insurance reserves are outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties sections of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging and potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  Further, the impact of social inflation continues to be significant and the trajectory of its future impact remains uncertain.  In addition, passage of reviver statutes that extend, or eliminate, the statute of limitations for the reporting of claims, including statutes passed in certain states with respect to sexual molestation and sexual abuse, increase the uncertainty of the frequency of claims.  These issues, have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of unforeseen emerging or potential claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict and may be material.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, we continually review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. When our recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves is recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges have been and in the future could be substantial.     7Table of ContentsOur actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine future policy benefit reserves for long-term care policies.Our future policy benefit reserves for long-term care policies are based on our best estimate actuarial assumptions, which are assessed quarterly and updated at least annually.  Key actuarial assumptions include morbidity, persistency (inclusive of mortality), anticipated future premium rate increases and expenses.  The adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and our future expectations related to these key assumptions.  If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring us to increase reserves.  The required increase in reserves is recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges have been and in the future could be substantial.  The reserves are discounted using upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yields as of each reporting date.  Discount rates are subject to interest rate and market volatility.  See the Life & Group Policyholder Reserves portion of Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.Morbidity and persistency experience, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care. A prolonged period during which investment returns remain at low levels could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long-term care policies.  This risk is more significant for our long-term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets.  In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases we request.  Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves. We are vulnerable to material losses from natural and man-made disasters.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses.  These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  Exposure to cyber risk is increasing systematically due to greater digital dependence, which increases the potential for, and the potential losses due to, a catastrophic cyber event.  Catastrophic cyber-attack scenarios are not bound by time or geographic limitations and cyber-related catastrophic perils don’t have well-established definitions or fundamental physical properties.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, its associated extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and its effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow. Climate studies by government agencies, academic institutions, catastrophe modeling organizations and other groups indicate that climate change may be altering the frequency and/or severity of catastrophic weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods and other natural disasters.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of our reinsurance coverage, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any.  It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Further, significant catastrophic events or a series of catastrophic events have the potential to impose financial stress on the reinsurance industry, which could impact our ability to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, thereby resulting in higher net incurred losses.Reinsurance coverage for ""unconventional"" terrorism events (such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks) is provided only in limited circumstances.  Our principal reinsurance protection against these large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (TRIPRA) through December 31, 2027.  However, such coverage is subject to a mandatory deductible and other limitations.  It is also possible that future legislation could change      8Table of Contentsor eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure.  For a further discussion of TRIPRA, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Catastrophes and Related Reinsurance.As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate, could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits, could lead to large losses and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance.  Accordingly, catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The COVID-19 pandemic, including new or emerging variants, other potential pandemics and related measures to mitigate the spread of the foregoing may continue to have adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could be material.We have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased claim submissions and litigation related to denial of claims based on policy coverage or the facts of the claim, in certain lines of business that are implicated by the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigating actions taken by our customers and governmental authorities in response to its spread.  These lines include primarily healthcare professional liability, workers' compensation, commercial property related business interruption coverage, management liability (directors and officers, employment practices and professional liability lines) and trade credit.  We recorded significant losses during 2020, a significant portion of which remain classified as incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves, in these areas and may experience continued losses, which could be material.Increased frequency or severity in any or all of the foregoing lines, or others where the exposure has yet to emerge, relating to long-term effects of COVID-19, new or emerging variants, or other potential pandemics, and related measures to mitigate the spread of the foregoing, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial expenses related to litigation activity in connection with COVID-related legal claims.  These actions primarily relate to denial of claims submitted as a result of the pandemic and the mitigating actions taken, including lockdowns and closing of certain businesses.  The significance of such litigation or any other litigation relating to new or emerging variants of COVID-19 or other potential pandemics and related measures to mitigate the spread of the foregoing, both in substance and volume, and the resultant Company-initiated activities, including external counsel engagement, and the costs related thereto, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by more traditional property and casualty claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer as of December 31, 2023 was $3.6 billion. If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.  Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO.  Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce our earnings.We are exposed to, and may face adverse developments related to, mass tort claims that could arise from,      9Table of Contentsamong other things, our insureds’ sale or use of potentially harmful products or substances, changes to the social and legal environment, such as those related to abuse reviver statutes, issues related to altered interpretation of coverage and other new and emerging claim theories.We face potential exposure to various types of existing, new and emerging mass tort claims, including those related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances, such as glyphosate, lead paint, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and opioids; claims arising from changes that expand the right to sue, remove limitations on recovery, extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms, such as those related to abuse reviver statutes, including New York reviver statutes; and claims related to new and emerging theories of liability, such as those related to global warming and climate change.  Evolving judicial interpretations and new legislation regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liability, as well as the application of insurance coverage to these claims, give rise to new and potentially more severe claim activity.  For example, we have recorded, and may continue to record, increases in our mass tort reserves, driven substantially by abuse reviver statutes that have resulted in increased claims.  Similar and continuing mass tort claim activity, including activity based on changing judicial interpretations and recent and proposed legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Strategic RisksWe face intense competition in our industry; we may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business and the evolving landscape of our distribution network.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services to remain competitive.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than we do, for both distributors and customers.  This includes agents, brokers and managing general underwriters who may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets continue to provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk.  Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, such as insurtech firms, resulting in increased pressures on our ability to remain competitive, particularly in obtaining pricing that is both attractive to our customer base and risk-appropriate to us.In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  We may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.We market our insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance brokers, and managing general underwriters who also promote and distribute the products of our competitors. Any change in our relationships with our distribution network agents, brokers or managing general underwriters, including as a result of consolidation or their increased promotion and distribution of our competitors' products, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products. As a result, our business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.Our underwriting strategies currently rely on the effectiveness of reinsurance arrangements and we accordingly face risks relating to reinsurance, including obtaining reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, reinsurance counterparty risk and ineffective reinsurance coverage.A primary reason we purchase reinsurance is to manage our exposure to risk, thereby facilitating our underwriting strategies in certain key areas.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, a reinsurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  The availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the volatility and profitability of our business, as well as the level and types of risk we retain, is determined by many factors, including general economic conditions and conditions in the reinsurance market, such as the occurrence of significant reinsured events or      10Table of Contentsunexpected adverse trends, including those associated with climate change.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, our risk exposure will not be mitigated to the degree desired or we may forego such increased risk, thereby adversely impacting our underwriting strategies.  In addition, use of reinsurance exposes us to credit risk of the reinsurers, as the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve us of the liability to the customer.  If a reinsurer is unable to meet its financial obligations under a reinsurance arrangement, we will remain obligated under the original policies issued to our customers.  Furthermore, while we use various risk management methods, including the use of reinsurance, to effectively manage risk, there is the possibility that one or more natural catastrophes and/or terrorism or other events could result in claims substantially exceeding expectations, thereby making the reinsurance strategy significantly less effective.  Such reinsurance-related risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our underwriting strategies in certain lines of business.We may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and our ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks.  For example, more insurers are utilizing ""big data"" analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing.  If such utilization is more effective than how we use our data and information, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies, or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.  For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact our competitive position.  Our efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.We face considerable competition within our industry for qualified, specialized talent and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies. The successful execution of our business strategies depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent.  Due to the intense competition in our industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized knowledge and industry experience in areas such as underwriting, data and analytics and technology, we may encounter obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are controlled by a single stockholder which could result in potential conflicts of interest.Loews beneficially owned approximately 92% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2023, and is in a position to control actions that require the consent of stockholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and any merger or sale of substantially all of our assets.  In addition, four officers of Loews, along with the Co-Chairman of the Board of Loews, serve on our Board of Directors.  We have also entered into services agreements and a registration rights agreement with Loews, and we may in the future enter into other agreements with Loews.  It is possible that potential conflicts of interest could arise in the future for our directors who are also officers and/or directors of Loews with respect to a number of areas relating to the past and ongoing relationships of Loews and us, including tax and insurance matters, financial commitments and sales of common stock pursuant to registration rights or otherwise.     11Table of ContentsFinancial RisksWe may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, interest rates, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.  Our investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid.  The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the portion of our investment portfolio that is carried at fair value in our financial statements is not reflective of the prices at which actual transactions could occur.We have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity investments, which could increase our net unrealized losses or reduce our net unrealized gains included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).  The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold or in the underlying collateral of the security.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in limited partnerships and common stock which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments, which may also limit our ability to withdraw funds from these investments.  The timing and amount of income or losses on such investments is inherently variable and can contribute to volatility in reported earnings.Further, we hold a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.  We are subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral, refinancing risk and the creditworthiness of tenants of credit tenant loan properties, where lease payments directly service the loan.  Any changes in actual or expected collections would result in a charge to earnings. As a result of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may be required to write down the value of our investments and may incur losses on the disposition of our investments all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Operational RisksWe use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving, catastrophe risks and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g. scenarios, predictive, stochastic and forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities.  This includes both proprietary and third-party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things.  We incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others.  The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary models and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis.  Further, climate change may make modeled outcomes less certain or produce new, non-modeled risks.     12Table of ContentsIn addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks, including the improper use of the model, input errors, data errors and human error.  As a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results.  Our profitability and financial condition substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs.  If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.Any significant interruption in the operation of our business functions, facilities and systems or our vendors' facilities and systems could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships and using our and their facilities and systems, necessary business functions, such as internet support and 24-hour call centers, processing new and renewal business, providing customer service, processing and paying claims and other obligations and issuing financial statements.  Our, or our vendors', facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber-attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics or pandemics, utility outages, interruptions of data processing and storage systems or unavailability of communications facilities.  An interruption in our system availability occurred in March 2021 as a result of a cybersecurity attack we sustained.  Please refer to the immediately following risk factor for further information regarding this incident.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure, interruption or corruption of one or more of our or our vendors' information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures or interruptions that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.  The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our or our vendors’ systems or facilities for these or any other reasons could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions in a timely basis. In addition, because our and our vendors' information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to perform necessary business functions. The foregoing risks could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  Potential additional exposures  relating to significant interruptions to our operations may include substantially increased compliance costs, as well as increased costs relating to investments in computer system and security-related upgrades, and such costs may not be recoverable under our relevant insurance coverage.  We have made, and continue to make, investments to improve our security and infrastructure.  Some of these investments are a direct result of the March 2021 cybersecurity attack, described in the immediately following risk factor, which are not recoverable under existing insurance coverage.  If our business continuity plans or system security do not sufficiently address these risks, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Any significant breach in our data security infrastructure or our vendors’ facilities and systems could disrupt business, cause financial losses and damage our reputation, and insurance coverage may not be available for claims related to a breach.A significant breach of our data security infrastructure may result from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators, or unknown third parties or through cyber-attacks.  The risk of a breach can exist whether software services are in our or third party administered data centers or are cloud-based software services.  Breaches have occurred, and may occur again, in our systems and in the systems of our vendors and third-party administrators. Such a breach could affect our data framework or cause a failure to protect the personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, or sensitive and confidential information regarding our business or policyholders and may result in operational impairments and financial losses, significant harm to our reputation and the loss of business with existing or potential customers.  The breach of confidential information also could      13Table of Contentsgive rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws, as well as evolving regulation in this regard.  During the second quarter of 2023, we were notified of a breach in the file transfer software, MOVEit Transfer, used by a vendor of one of our third-party administrators.  This incident resulted in required breach notifications to the Company's long-term care policyholders, with such notifications made by the subject vendor.  While we do not believe such notifications and resultant actions will have a material adverse effect on our business, this or similar incidents, or any other such breach of our or our vendors’ data security infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.As previously disclosed, we sustained a sophisticated cybersecurity attack in March 2021 involving ransomware that caused a network disruption and impacted certain of our systems.  Our investigation into the incident revealed that an unauthorized third party copied some personal information relating to certain current and former employees, contract workers and their dependents and certain other persons, including some policyholders.  Although we currently have no indication that the impacted data has been misused, or that CNA or its policyholder data was specifically targeted by the unauthorized third party, we may be subject to subsequent investigations, claims or actions in addition to other costs, fines, penalties, or other obligations related to impacted data, whether or not such data is misused.  In addition, the misuse, or perceived misuse, of sensitive or confidential information regarding our business or policyholders could cause harm to our reputation and result in the loss of business with existing or potential customers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Although we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage insuring against costs resulting from cyber-attacks (including the March 2021 attack), we do not expect the amount available under our coverage policy to cover all losses from cyber-attacks.  In addition, potential disputes with our insurers about the availability of insurance coverage could occur.  Further, should we experience future cyber incidents, or should industry trends drive rate increases resulting from growth in volume and significance of cyber incidents broadly, we may incur higher costs for cybersecurity insurance coverage. The risks relating to future breaches in our, or our vendors', data security infrastructure, including in connection with cyber incidents, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition or may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third-party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on our behalf could result in a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may incur losses which arise from employees or third-party service providers engaging in intentional, negligent or inadvertent misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.  Our or our third-party service providers' controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of such noncompliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.  Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Portions of our insurance business is underwritten and serviced by third parties.  With respect to underwriting, our contractual arrangements with third parties will typically grant them limited rights to write new and renewal policies, subject to contractual restrictions and obligations, including requiring them to underwrite within the terms of our licenses.  Should these third parties issue policies that exceed these contractual restrictions, we could be deemed liable for such policies and subject to regulatory fines and penalties for any breach of licensing requirements.  It is possible that in such circumstance we might not be fully indemnified for such third parties’ contractual breaches.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrator of our long-term care claims, to handle policyholder services and perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.     14Table of ContentsWe have also licensed certain systems from third parties.  We cannot be certain that we will have access to these systems or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended.These risks could adversely impact our reputation and client relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Loss of key vendor relationships and issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could compromise our ability to conduct business.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may be adversely affected.  We may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties, failure by vendors to properly perform service functions or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.  Our inability to provide for appropriate servicing if a vendor becomes unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, either through transitioning to another service provider temporarily or permanently or assuming servicing internally, may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  In the U.S., these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction's regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves, or the occurrence of a catastrophic event or otherwise, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates our capital position, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.The IAIS has adopted a ComFrame for the supervision of IAIGs and has developed a global capital standard that, if adopted in the U.S., would be applicable to U.S.-based IAIGs.  The NAIC also developed the GCC and AM approach to assessing group capital as an alternative to the ICS developed by the IAIS.  The development and adoption of these capital standards could increase our prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase our cost of regulatory compliance.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator, are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, we may not be able to fund our corporate obligations and debt service requirements or pay our stockholders dividends from available cash.  As a result, we would need to pursue other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us, thereby adversely affecting our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all and increasing our cost of capital.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's      15Table of Contentsfinancial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders, and may also reflect opinions on other areas such as information security and climate risk, as well as ESG matters more broadly. The rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.  Further, if one or more of our corporate debt ratings were downgraded, we may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs.In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse effect on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.  For further discussion of our ratings, see the Ratings subsection within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business.  Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.  In addition, rules and regulations have recently been introduced, or are being considered, in the areas of information security and ESG, which may also affect our business.  We also are subject to numerous regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients and employees, including medical records, credit card data and financial information.  These laws and regulations, including regulations related to cybersecurity protocols (which continue to evolve in breadth, sophistication and maturity in response to an ever-evolving threat landscape), are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, sometimes conflict, and could expose us to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.  In response to climate change, regulators at the federal, state and international level also could impose new regulations requiring disclosure of underwriting or investment in certain industry sectors. Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible or restrict us from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.     16Table of Contents"
5,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2023-02-07,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. We have described below material risks that we face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be material that may also affect our business. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.Insurance RisksIf we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date.  The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain.  These factors can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events.  Key variables include frequency of claims, claim severity, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, economic, social and medical inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as long term care, workers' compensation, general liability and professional liability, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled.  The impact of changes in economic and social inflation, and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.  Certain risks and uncertainties associated with our insurance reserves are outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties sections of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  Further, the impact of social inflation continues to be significant and the trajectory of its future impact remains uncertain.  These issues, have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict and may be material.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, we continually review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. If our recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.Our actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine future policy benefit reserves for long term care policies.Our future policy benefit reserves for long term care policies are based on our best estimate assumptions as of September 30, 2020, due to a reserve unlocking at that date.  Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases. Estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain because the adequacy of the reserves is      7Table of Contentscontingent upon actual experience and our future expectations related to these key assumptions.  If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring us to add reserves.  The required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.  See the Life & Group Policyholder Reserves portion of Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.Morbidity and persistency experience, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care. A prolonged period during which investment returns remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving discount rate assumptions could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require increases to our reserves.  This risk is more significant for our long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets.  Further, changes to the Internal Revenue Code may also affect the rate at which we discount our reserves.  In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases we request.  Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves. We are vulnerable to material losses from natural and man-made disasters.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses.  These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  Exposure to cyber risk is increasing systematically due to greater digital dependence, which increases the potential for, and the potential losses due to, a catastrophic cyber event.  Catastrophic cyber-attack scenarios are not bound by time or geographic limitations and cyber-related catastrophic perils don’t have well-established definitions or fundamental physical properties.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, its associated extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and its effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow. Climate studies by government agencies, academic institutions, catastrophe modeling organizations and other groups indicate that climate change may be altering the frequency and/or severity of catastrophic weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods and other natural disasters.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance coverage, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any.  It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Further, significant catastrophic events or a series of catastrophic events have the potential to impose financial stress on the reinsurance industry, which could impact our ability to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, thereby resulting in higher net incurred losses.Reinsurance coverage for ""unconventional"" terrorism events (such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks) is provided only in limited circumstances.  Our principal reinsurance protection against these large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (TRIPRA) through December 31, 2027.  However, such coverage is subject to a mandatory deductible and other limitations.  It is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure.  For a further discussion of TRIPRA, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Catastrophes and Related Reinsurance.As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate, could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance.       8Table of ContentsAccordingly, catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to mitigate the spread of the virus have resulted in increased claims and related litigation risk across our enterprise, which may continue to have adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could be material.We have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased claim submissions and litigation related to denial of claims based on policy coverage or the facts of the claim, in certain lines of business that are implicated by the pandemic and mitigating actions taken by our customers and governmental authorities in response to its spread.  These lines include primarily healthcare professional liability, workers' compensation, commercial property related business interruption coverage, management liability (directors and officers, employment practices and professional liability lines) and trade credit.  We recorded significant losses during 2020, the majority of which are classified as incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves, in these areas and may experience continued losses, which could be material.Increased frequency or severity in any or all of the foregoing lines, or others where the exposure has yet to emerge, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial expenses related to litigation activity in connection with COVID-related legal claims.  These actions primarily relate to denial of claims submitted as a result of the pandemic and the mitigating actions under commercial property policies for business interruption coverage, including lockdowns and closing of certain businesses.  The significance of such litigation, both in substance and volume, and the resultant activities we have initiated, including external counsel engagement, and the costs related thereto, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer as of December 31, 2022 was $3.5 billion. If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.  Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO.  Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce our earnings.We are exposed to, and may face adverse developments related to, mass tort claims that could arise from, among other things, our insureds’ sale or use of potentially harmful products or substances, changes to the social and legal environment, issues related to altered interpretation of coverage and other new and emerging claim theories.We face potential exposure to various types of existing, new and emerging mass tort claims, including those related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances, such as glyphosate, lead paint, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and opioids; claims arising from changes that expand the right to sue, remove limitations on recovery, extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms, such as those related to abuse reviver statutes, including New York reviver statutes; and claims related to new and emerging theories of liability, such as those related to global warming and climate change.  Evolving      9Table of Contentsjudicial interpretations and new legislation regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liability, as well as the application of insurance coverage to these claims, give rise to new and potentially more severe claim activity.  Mass tort claim activity, including activity based on such changing judicial interpretations and recent and proposed legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Strategic RisksWe face intense competition in our industry; we may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business and the evolving landscape of our distribution network.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services to remain competitive.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than we do, for both distributors and customers.  This includes agents, brokers and managing general underwriters who may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets continue to provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk.  Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, such as insurtech firms, resulting in increased pressures on our ability to remain competitive, particularly in obtaining pricing that is both attractive to our customer base and risk-appropriate to us.In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.We market our insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance brokers, and managing general underwriters who also promote and distribute the products of our competitors. Any change in our relationships with our distribution network agents, brokers or managing general underwriters, including as a result of consolidation or their increased promotion and distribution of our competitors' products, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products. As a result, our business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.Our underwriting strategies currently rely on the effectiveness of reinsurance arrangements and we accordingly face risks relating to reinsurance, including obtaining reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, reinsurance counterparty risk and ineffective reinsurance coverage.A primary reason we purchase reinsurance is to manage our exposure to risk, thereby facilitating our underwriting strategies in certain key areas.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, a reinsurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  The availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the volatility and profitability of our business, as well as the level and types of risk we retain, is determined by general economic conditions and conditions in the reinsurance market, such as the occurrence of significant reinsured events or unexpected adverse trends, including those associated with climate change.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, our risk exposure will not be mitigated or we may forego such increased risk, thereby adversely impacting our underwriting strategies.  In addition, use of reinsurance exposes us to credit risk of the reinsurers, as the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve us of the liability to the customer.  If a reinsurer is unable to meet its financial obligations under a reinsurance arrangement, we will remain obligated under the original policies issued to our customers.  Furthermore, while we use various risk management methods, including the use of reinsurance, to effectively manage risk, there is the possibility that one or more natural catastrophes and/or terrorism or other events could result in claims substantially exceeding expectations, thereby making the reinsurance strategy significantly less effective.  Such reinsurance-related risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our underwriting strategies in certain lines of business.     10Table of ContentsWe may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and our ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks.  For example, more insurers are utilizing ""big data"" analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing.  If such utilization is more effective than how we use similar data and information, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies, or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.  For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact our competitive position.  Our efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.We face considerable competition within our industry for qualified, specialized talent and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies.The successful execution of our business strategies depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent.  Due to the intense competition in our industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized knowledge and industry experience in areas such as underwriting, data and analytics and technology, we may encounter obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are controlled by a single stockholder which could result in potential conflicts of interest.Loews beneficially owned approximately 90% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2022, and is in a position to control actions that require the consent of stockholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and any merger or sale of substantially all of our assets.  In addition, four officers of Loews, along with the Co-Chairman of the Board of Loews, serve on our Board of Directors.  We have also entered into services agreements and a registration rights agreement with Loews, and we may in the future enter into other agreements with Loews.  It is possible that potential conflicts of interest could arise in the future for our directors who are also officers and/or directors of Loews with respect to a number of areas relating to the past and ongoing relationships of Loews and us, including tax and insurance matters, financial commitments and sales of common stock pursuant to registration rights or otherwise.Financial RisksWe may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.  Our investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid.  The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the portion of our investment portfolio that is carried at fair value in our financial statements is not reflective of the prices at which actual transactions could occur.We have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity      11Table of Contentsinvestments, which could reduce our net unrealized gains included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).  The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold or in the underlying collateral of the security.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in limited partnerships and common stock which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments, which may also limit our ability to withdraw funds from these investments.  The timing and amount of income or losses on such investments is inherently variable and can contribute to volatility in reported earnings.Further, we hold a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.  We are subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral, refinancing risk and the creditworthiness of tenants of credit tenant loan properties, where lease payments directly service the loan.  Any changes in actual or expected collections would result in a charge to earnings. As a result of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may be required to write down the value of our investments and may incur losses on the disposition of our investments all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Operational RisksWe use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving, catastrophe risks and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g. scenarios, predictive, stochastic and forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities.  This includes both proprietary and third-party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things.  We incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others.  The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary models and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis.  Further, climate change may make modeled outcomes less certain or produce new, non-modeled risks.In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks, including the improper use of the model, input errors, data errors and human error.  As a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results.  Our profitability and financial condition substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs.  If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.Any significant interruption in the operation of our business functions, facilities and systems or our vendors' facilities and systems could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships and using our and their facilities and systems, necessary business functions, such as internet support and 24-hour call centers, processing new and renewal business, providing customer service, processing and paying claims and other obligations and issuing financial statements.  Our, or our vendors', facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber-attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics or pandemics, utility outages, interruptions of data processing and storage systems or unavailability of communications facilities. An interruption in our system availability occurred in March 2021 as a result of a cybersecurity attack we sustained.  Please refer to the      12Table of Contentsimmediately following risk factor for further information regarding this incident.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure, interruption or corruption of one or more of our or our vendors' information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures or interruptions that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.  The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our or our vendors’ systems or facilities for these or any other reasons could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions in a timely basis. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to perform necessary business functions. The foregoing risks could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  Potential additional exposures  relating to significant interruptions to our operations may include substantially increased compliance costs, as well as increased costs relating to investments in computer system and security-related upgrades, and such costs may not be recoverable under our relevant insurance coverage.  We have made, and continue to make, investments to improve our security and infrastructure.  Some of these investments are a direct result of the March 2021 cybersecurity attack, described in the immediately following risk factor, which are not recoverable under existing insurance coverage.  If our business continuity plans or system security do not sufficiently address these risks, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Any significant breach in our data security infrastructure or our vendors’ facilities and systems could disrupt business, cause financial losses and damage our reputation, and insurance coverage may not be available for claims related to a breach.A significant breach of our data security infrastructure may result from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators, or unknown third parties or through cyber-attacks.  The risk of a breach can exist whether software services are in our or third party administered data centers or are cloud-based software services.  Breaches have occurred, and may occur again, in our systems and in the systems of our vendors and third-party administrators. Such a breach could affect our data framework or cause a failure to protect the personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, or sensitive and confidential information regarding our business or policyholders and may result in operational impairments and financial losses, significant harm to our reputation and the loss of business with existing or potential customers.  The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws, as well as evolving regulation in this regard.  During the third quarter of 2021, we were notified of a breach of certain systems of a third-party administrator, which resulted in breach notifications sent by such administrator to potentially impacted persons, including a limited number of our claimants. While we do not believe such notifications and resultant actions will have a material adverse effect on our business, this or similar incidents, or any other such breach of our or our vendors’ data security infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.As previously disclosed, we sustained a sophisticated cybersecurity attack in March 2021 involving ransomware that caused a network disruption and impacted certain of our systems. Our investigation into the incident revealed that an unauthorized third party copied some personal information relating to certain current and former employees, contract workers and their dependents and certain other persons, including some policyholders.  Although we currently have no indication that the impacted data has been misused, or that CNA or its policyholder data was specifically targeted by the unauthorized third party, we may be subject to subsequent investigations, claims or actions in addition to other costs, fines, penalties, or other obligations related to impacted data, whether or not such data is misused.  In addition, the misuse, or perceived misuse, of sensitive or confidential information regarding our business or policyholders could cause harm to our reputation and result in the loss of business with existing or potential customers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.       13Table of ContentsAlthough we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage insuring against costs resulting from cyber-attacks (including the March 2021 attack), we do not expect the amount available under our coverage policy to cover all losses from cyber-attacks.  In addition, potential disputes with our insurers about the availability of insurance coverage could occur.  Further, as a result of the March 2021 attack, we incurred higher costs for the replenishment of our current policy through the end of the term, and we believe we will incur higher costs for future cybersecurity insurance coverage beyond the current term.  We may also be subject to future cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition or may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third-party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on our behalf could result in a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may incur losses which arise from employees or third-party service providers engaging in intentional, negligent or inadvertent misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.  Our or our third-party service providers' controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of such noncompliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.  Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Portions of our insurance business is underwritten and serviced by third parties.  With respect to underwriting, our contractual arrangements with third parties will typically grant them limited rights to write new and renewal policies, subject to contractual restrictions and obligations, including requiring them to underwrite within the terms of our licenses.  Should these third parties issue policies that exceed these contractual restrictions, we could be deemed liable for such policies and subject to regulatory fines and penalties for any breach of licensing requirements.  It is possible that in such circumstance we might not be fully indemnified for such third parties’ contractual breaches.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrator of our long term care claims, to handle policyholder services and perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We have also licensed certain systems from third parties.  We cannot be certain that we will have access to these systems or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended.These risks could adversely impact our reputation and client relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Loss of key vendor relationships and issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could compromise our ability to conduct business.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may be adversely affected.  We may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties, failure by vendors to properly perform service functions or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.  Our inability to provide for appropriate servicing if a vendor becomes unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, either through transitioning to another service provider temporarily or permanently or assuming servicing internally, may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.     14Table of ContentsWe are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  In the U.S., these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction's regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves, or the occurrence of a catastrophic event or otherwise, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates our capital position, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.The IAIS has adopted a ComFrame for the supervision of IAIGs and has developed a global capital standard that, if adopted in the U.S., would be applicable to U.S.-based IAIGs.  The NAIC also developed the GCC and AM approach to assessing group capital as an alternative to the ICS developed by the IAIS.  The development and adoption of these capital standards could increase our prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase our cost of regulatory compliance.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator, are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, we may not be able to fund our corporate obligations and debt service requirements or pay our stockholders dividends from available cash.  As a result, we would need to pursue other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us, thereby adversely affecting our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all and increasing our cost of capital.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders, and may also reflect opinions on other areas such as information security and climate risk, as well as ESG matters more broadly. The rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.  Further, if one or more of our corporate debt ratings were downgraded, we may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs.In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse effect on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.       15Table of ContentsFor further discussion of our ratings, see the Ratings subsection within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business.  Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.  In addition, rules and regulations have recently been introduced, or are being considered, in the areas of information security and ESG, which may also affect our business.  We also are subject to numerous regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients and employees, including medical records, credit card data and financial information.  These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, sometimes conflict, and could expose us to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions, including regulations related to cyber security protocols (which continue to evolve in breadth, sophistication and maturity in response to an ever-evolving threat landscape).  In response to climate change, regulators at the federal, state and international level also could impose new regulations requiring disclosure of underwriting or investment in certain industry sectors. Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible or restrict us from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.     16Table of Contents"
17,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2022-02-08,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. We have described below material risks that we face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be material that may also affect our business. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.Insurance RisksIf we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date. The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain. These variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events. Key variables include frequency of claims, claim severity, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, economic, social and medical inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Mortality is the relative incidence of death. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as workers' compensation, general liability and professional liability, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled. The impact of changes in economic and social inflation, and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period. Certain risks and uncertainties associated with our insurance reserves are outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties sections of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  Further, the impact of social inflation continues to be significant and the trajectory of its future impact remains uncertain.  These issues, as well as social inflation, have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict and may be material.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, we continually review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. If our recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.Our actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.Our active life reserves for long term care policies are based on our best estimate assumptions as of September 30, 2020, due to a reserve unlocking at that date. Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the 8Table of Contentspercentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases. Estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain because the adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and our future expectations related to these key assumptions. If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring us to add reserves. The required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial. See the Life & Group Policyholder Reserves portion of Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.Morbidity and persistency experience, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.A prolonged period during which investment returns remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving discount rate assumptions could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require increases to our reserves. This risk is more significant for our long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. Further, changes to the Internal Revenue Code may also affect the rate at which we discount our reserves. In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases we request. Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves. We are vulnerable to material losses from natural and man-made disasters.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance coverage, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any. It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility. Further, significant catastrophic events or a series of catastrophic events have the potential to impose financial stress on the reinsurance industry, which could impact our ability to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, thereby resulting in higher net incurred losses. Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. Our principal reinsurance protection against these large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (TRIPRA) through December 31, 2027. However, such coverage is subject to a mandatory deductible and other limitations. It is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure. For a further discussion of TRIPRA, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Catastrophes and Related Reinsurance.As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate, could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance. 9Table of ContentsAccordingly, catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to mitigate the spread of the virus have resulted in increased claims and related litigation risk across our enterprise, which may continue to have adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could be material.We have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased claim submissions and litigation related to denial of claims based on policy coverage or the facts of the claim, in certain lines of business that are implicated by the pandemic and mitigating actions taken by our customers and governmental authorities in response to its spread. These lines include primarily healthcare professional liability, workers' compensation, commercial property related business interruption coverage, management liability (directors and officers, employment practices, and professional liability lines) and trade credit. We recorded significant losses during 2020, the majority of which are classified as incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves, in these areas and may experience continued losses, which could be material.Increased frequency or severity in any or all of the foregoing lines, or others where the exposure has yet to emerge, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial expenses related to litigation activity in connection with COVID-related legal claims. These actions primarily relate to denial of claims submitted as a result of the pandemic and the mitigating actions under commercial property policies for business interruption coverage, including lockdowns and closing of certain businesses. The significance of such litigation, both in substance and volume, and the resultant activities we have initiated, including external counsel engagement, and the costs related thereto, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims. Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability. On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer). The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer as of December 31, 2021 was $3.4 billion. If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings. These charges could be substantial. Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO. Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce our earnings.We are exposed to, and may face adverse developments related to, mass tort claims that could arise from our insureds’ sale or use of potentially harmful products or substances, changes to the social and legal environment, issues related to altered interpretation of coverage and other new and emerging claim theories.We face potential exposure to various types of new and emerging mass tort claims, including those related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances such as glyphosate, lead paint and opioids; claims arising from changes that expand the right to sue, remove limitations on recovery, extend the statutes of 10Table of Contentslimitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms, such as those related to abuse reviver statutes, including New York reviver statutes; and claims related to new and emerging theories of liability, such as those related to global warming and climate change. Evolving judicial interpretations and new legislation regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liability, as well as the application of insurance coverage to these claims, give rise to new claimant activity. Emerging mass tort claim activity, including activity based on such changing judicial interpretations and recent and proposed legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Strategic RisksWe face intense competition in our industry; we may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business and the evolving landscape of our distribution network.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services to remain competitive.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than we do, for both distributors and customers.  This includes agents, brokers and managing general underwriters who may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets continue to provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk.  Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, such as insurtech firms, resulting in increased pressures on our ability to remain competitive, particularly in obtaining pricing that is both attractive to our customer base and risk-appropriate to us.In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.We market our insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance brokers, and managing general underwriters who also promote and distribute the products of our competitors.  Any change in our relationships with our distribution network agents, brokers or managing general underwriters, including as a result of consolidation and their increased promotion and distribution of our competitors' products, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.  As a result, our business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.Our underwriting strategies currently rely on the effectiveness of reinsurance arrangements and we accordingly face risks relating to reinsurance, including obtaining reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, reinsurance counterparty risk and ineffective reinsurance coverage.A primary reason we purchase reinsurance is to manage our exposure to risk, thereby facilitating our underwriting strategies in certain key areas. Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, a reinsurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the volatility of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain. If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, our risk exposure will not be mitigated or we may forego such increased risk, thereby adversely impacting our underwriting strategies. In addition, use of reinsurance exposes us to credit risk of the reinsurers, as the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve us of the liability to the customer. If a reinsurer is unable to meet its financial obligations under a reinsurance arrangement, we will remain obligated under the original policies issued to our customers. Furthermore, while we use various risk management methods, including the use of reinsurance, to effectively manage risk, there is the possibility that one or more natural catastrophes and/or terrorism or other events could result in claims 11Table of Contentssubstantially exceeding expectations, thereby making the reinsurance strategy significantly less effective. Such reinsurance-related risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our underwriting strategies in certain lines of business.We may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and our ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks.  For example, more insurers are utilizing ""big data"" analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing.  If such utilization is more effective than how we use similar data and information, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies, or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.  For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact our competitive position.  Our efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.  We face considerable competition within our industry for qualified, specialized talent and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies.The successful execution of our business plan depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent.  Due to the intense competition in our industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized knowledge and industry experience in areas such as underwriting, data and analytics and technology, we may encounter obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are controlled by a single stockholder which could result in potential conflicts of interest.Loews beneficially owned approximately 89.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2021, and is in a position to control actions that require the consent of stockholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and any merger or sale of substantially all of our assets.  In addition, four officers of Loews, along with the Co-Chairman of the Board of Loews, serve on our Board of Directors.  We have also entered into services agreements and a registration rights agreement with Loews, and we may in the future enter into other agreements with Loews.  It is possible that potential conflicts of interest could arise in the future for our directors who are also officers and/or directors of Loews with respect to a number of areas relating to the past and ongoing relationships of Loews and us, including tax and insurance matters, financial commitments and sales of common stock pursuant to registration rights or otherwise.Financial RisksWe may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.  Our investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid.  The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the portion of our investment portfolio that is carried at fair value in our financial statements is not reflective of the prices at which actual transactions could occur.12Table of ContentsWe have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity investments, which could reduce our net unrealized gains included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).  The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold or in the underlying collateral of the security.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in limited partnerships and common stock which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments which may also limit our ability to withdraw funds from these investments.  The timing and amount of income or losses on such investments is inherently variable and can contribute to volatility in reported earnings.Further, we hold a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.  We are subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral, refinancing risk and the creditworthiness of tenants of credit tenant loan properties, where lease payments directly service the loan.  Any changes in actual or expected collections would result in a charge to earnings.  As a result of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may be required to write down the value of our investments and may incur losses on the disposition of our investments all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Operational RisksWe use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving, catastrophe risks and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g. scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities.  This includes both proprietary and third-party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things.  We incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others.  The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary models and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis.  Further, climate change may make modeled outcomes less certain or produce new, non-modeled risks.In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks, including the improper use of the model, input errors, data errors and human error.  As a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results.  Our profitability and financial condition substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs.  If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.Any significant interruption in the operation of our business functions, facilities and systems or our vendors' facilities and systems could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships and using our and their facilities and systems, necessary business functions, such as internet support and 24-hour call centers, processing new and renewal business, providing customer service, processing and paying claims and other obligations and issuing financial statements.  Our, or our vendors', facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or 13Table of Contentscyber-attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics or pandemics, utility outages, interruptions of data processing and storage systems or unavailability of communications facilities. An interruption in our system availability occurred in March 2021 as a result of a cybersecurity attack we sustained.  Please refer to the immediately following risk factor for further information regarding this incident.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure, interruption or corruption of one or more of our or our vendors' information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures or interruptions that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.  The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our or our vendors’ systems or facilities for these or any other reasons could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions in a timely basis. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to perform necessary business functions. The foregoing risks could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  Potential exposures resulting from the March 2021 cybersecurity attack, described in the immediately following risk, as well as any future incidents may include substantially increased compliance costs, as well as increased costs relating to investments in computer system and security-related upgrades, with those costs potentially not recoverable under relevant insurance coverage.  We anticipate making continued investments to improve our security and infrastructure, which are not recoverable under relevant insurance coverage.  If our business continuity plans or system security do not sufficiently address these risks, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Any significant breach in our data security infrastructure or our vendors’ facilities and systems could disrupt business, cause financial losses and damage our reputation, and insurance coverage may not be available for claims related to a breach.A significant breach of our data security infrastructure may result from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators, or unknown third parties or through cyber-attacks.  The risk of a breach can exist whether software services are in our data centers or are cloud-based software services.  Breaches have occurred, and may occur again, in our systems and in the systems of our vendors and third-party administrators. Such a breach could affect our data framework or cause a failure to protect the personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, or sensitive and confidential information regarding our business and may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.  The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws, as well as evolving regulation in this regard.  During the third quarter of 2021, we were notified of a breach of certain systems of a third-party administrator, which resulted in breach notifications sent by such administrator to potentially impacted persons, including a limited number of our claimants. While we do not believe such notifications and resultant actions will have a material adverse effect on our business, this or similar incidents, or any other such breach of our or our vendors’ data security infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We sustained a sophisticated cybersecurity attack in March 2021 involving ransomware that caused a network disruption and impacted certain of our systems.  Upon detection, we undertook steps to address the incident, including engaging a team of third-party forensic experts and notifying law enforcement and key regulators. We restored network systems and resumed normal operations.  We are continuing to assess all actions that we will take to improve our existing systems.Our investigation revealed that an unauthorized third party copied some personal information relating to certain current and former employees, contractor workers and their dependents and certain other persons, including some policyholders.  In July 2021, we provided notifications to the impacted individuals and to regulators, in accordance with applicable law.  Although we currently have no indication that the impacted data has been misused, or that CNA or its policyholder data was specifically targeted by the unauthorized third party, we may be subject to subsequent investigations, claims or actions in addition to other costs, fines, penalties, or other obligations related to impacted data, whether or not such data is misused.  In addition, the misuse, or perceived 14Table of Contentsmisuse, of sensitive or confidential information regarding our business or policyholders could cause harm to our reputation and result in the loss of business with existing or potential customers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Although we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage insuring against costs resulting from cyber-attacks (including the March 2021 attack), we do not expect the amount available under our coverage policy to cover all losses.  Costs and expenses incurred and that we are likely to incur in connection with the March 2021 attack include both direct and indirect costs and are not all covered by our insurance coverage.  In addition, potential disputes with our insurers about the availability of insurance coverage for claims relating to the March 2021 attack or any future incident could occur.  Further, as a result of the March 2021 attack, we incurred higher costs for the replenishment of our current policy through the end of the term, and we believe we will incur higher costs for future cybersecurity insurance coverage beyond the current term.Based on the information currently known, we do not believe that the March 2021 cybersecurity attack will have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but no assurances can be given as we continue to assess the full impact from the incident, including costs, expenses and insurance coverage. We may also be subject to future incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition or may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third-party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on our behalf could result in a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may incur losses which arise from employees or third-party service providers engaging in intentional, negligent or inadvertent misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.  Our or our third-party service providers' controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of such noncompliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.  Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Portions of our insurance business is underwritten and serviced by third parties.  With respect to underwriting, our contractual arrangements with third parties will typically grant them limited rights to write new and renewal policies, subject to contractual restrictions and obligations, including requiring them to underwrite within the terms of our licenses.  Should these third parties issue policies that exceed these contractual restrictions, we could be deemed liable for such policies and subject to regulatory fines and penalties for any breach of licensing requirements.  It is possible that in such circumstance we might not be fully indemnified for such third parties’ contractual breaches.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of our long term care claims, to handle policyholder services and perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We have also licensed certain systems from third parties.  We cannot be certain that we will have access to these systems or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended.These risks could adversely impact our reputation and client relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.15Table of ContentsLoss of key vendor relationships and issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could compromise our ability to conduct business.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may be adversely affected.  We may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties, failure by vendors to properly perform service functions or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.  Our inability to provide for appropriate servicing if a vendor becomes unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, either through transitioning to another service provider temporarily or permanently or assuming servicing internally, may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  In the U.S., these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction's regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves or the occurrence of a catastrophic event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates our capital position, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.The IAIS has adopted a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups and continues to develop a group basis ICS.  The NAIC is also developing a group capital standard that is intended to be comparable to the ICS.  The development and adoption of these capital standards could increase our prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase our cost of regulatory compliance.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator, are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, we may not be able to fund our corporate obligations and debt service requirements or pay our stockholders dividends from available cash.  As a result, we would need to pursue other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us, thereby adversely affecting our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all and increasing our cost of capital.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders, and may also reflect opinions on other areas such as information security and ESG matters. 16Table of ContentsThe rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.  Further, if one or more of our corporate debt ratings were downgraded, we may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs.In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse effect on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.  For further discussion of our ratings, see the Ratings subsection within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business.  Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers. In addition, rules and regulations have recently been introduced, or are being considered, in the areas of information security and ESG, which may also affect our business. Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible or restrict us from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.17Table of Contents"
4,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2021-02-09,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.  We have described below material risks that we face.  There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be material that may also affect our business.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.COVID-19 RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures to mitigate the spread of the virus have resulted in significant risk across our enterprise, which have had, and may continue to have, material adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.The COVID-19 outbreak, and actions seeking to mitigate the spread of the virus, accelerated in both breadth and scope through early 2020, with the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic on March 11, 2020.  The situation has continued to evolve exponentially with implicated exposures increasing given sustained uncertainties across the global marketplace.  Both the extensiveness of the pandemic itself, as well as the measures taken to mitigate the virus' spread globally, are unprecedented and their effects continue to be pervasive.  While vaccination efforts have begun, in many geographic locations, the virus continues to spread.  Accordingly, it remains the case that nearly a year past the initial identification of the threat, all of the direct and indirect consequences and implications of COVID-19 and measures to mitigate its spread are not yet known and may not emerge for some time.Risks presented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 that are known at this time include the following:Broad economic impactThe economic effect of the pandemic has been broad in nature and has significantly impacted business operations across all industries, including ours.  Depressed economic conditions have led to, and may continue to lead to, decreased insured exposures causing us to experience declines in premium volume, especially for lines of business that are sensitive to rates of economic growth and those that are impacted by audit premium adjustments.  Significant decreases in premium volume directly and adversely impacts our underwriting expense ratio.  We recorded a decrease in our estimated audit premiums during the second quarter of 2020 impacting our net earned premium and if general economic conditions do not improve, our net written premiums and net earned premiums may be depressed, which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.While our losses incurred during 2020 related to COVID-19 and measures to mitigate its spread represent our best estimate of our ultimate insurance losses resulting from events occurring during 2020 due to the pandemic and the consequent economic crisis, given the unprecedented nature of this event, a high level of uncertainty exists as to the potential impact on insurance losses from these events or other events that might occur in the future.  The scope, duration and magnitude of the direct and indirect effects could continue to evolve, and could materially impact our ultimate loss estimate, including in lines of business where losses have already been incurred, as well as the potential for impacts in other lines unknown at this time.  Continued spread of the virus, as well as new or extended shelter in place restrictions and full or partial business closures, could cause us to experience additional COVID-19 related catastrophe losses in future quarters, which could be material.  For further discussion of risks associated with catastrophe losses, see the Risk Factor, ""We are vulnerable to material losses from natural and man-made disasters.""7Table of ContentsFinancial Markets and InvestmentsThe COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly impacted financial markets.  As investors have embarked on a flight to quality, risk free rates have decreased.  In addition, liquidity concerns and overall economic uncertainties drove increased volatility in credit spreads and equity markets.  While government actions to date have provided some stability to financial markets, economic prospects in the short term continue to be depressed and we remain in a historically low interest rate environment.  The continued spread of the virus and the extension of efforts to mitigate the spread in numerous geographic areas will continue to cause substantial uncertainty on the timing and strength of any economic recovery and could continue to impact our investment portfolio results and valuations, and may result in additional volatility or losses in our investment portfolio, which could be material.These significant financial market disruptions may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.  For further discussion of risks associated with our investments, see the Risk Factor, “We may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.”Claims and related litigationWe have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, increased claim submissions and litigation related to denial of claims based on policy coverage, in certain lines of business that are implicated by the pandemic and mitigating actions taken by our customers and governmental authorities in response to its spread.  These lines include primarily healthcare professional liability, workers' compensation, commercial property-related business interruption coverage, management liability (directors and officers, employment practices, and professional liability lines) and trade credit.  We have recorded significant losses in these areas during 2020 and may experience continued losses, which could be material.  In addition, our surety lines may experience increased losses, particularly in construction surety, where there is significant risk that contractors will be adversely and materially impacted by a prolonged decline in economic conditions. Increased frequency or severity in any or all of the foregoing lines, or others where the exposure has yet to emerge, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial expenses related to litigation activity in connection with COVID-related legal claims.  These actions primarily relate to denial of claims submitted as a result of the pandemic and the mitigating actions under commercial property policies for business interruption coverage, including lockdowns and closing of certain businesses.  The significance of such litigation, both in substance and volume,  and the resultant  activities we have initiated, including external counsel engagement, and the costs related thereto, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.Regulatory impactThe regulatory environment is rapidly evolving in direct response to the pandemic and the related mitigating actions.  Numerous regulatory authorities to which our business is subject have implemented or are contemplating broad and significant regulations restricting and governing insurance company operations during the pandemic crisis.  Such actions include, but are not limited to, premium moratoriums, premium refunds and reductions, restrictions on policy cancellations and potential legislation-driven expansion of policy terms.  To date, certain state authorities have ordered premium refunds and certain regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed requiring insurers to cover business interruption under policies that were not written to provide for such coverage under the current circumstances.  In addition, certain states have directed expansion of workers’ compensation coverage through presumption of compensability of claims for a broad category of workers.  This highly fluid and challenging regulatory environment, and the new regulations we are now, and may be, subject to may have a material impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.  For further discussion of risks associated with our regulatory environment, see the Risk Factor, “We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional 8Table of Contentsregulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”Business operational impactBeginning in March 2020, we instituted mandatory work from home for our employees, with the exception of employees performing certain essential operations, across the United States and globally, including Canada, the U.K. and Europe, and moved to teleconference meetings only across the enterprise.  As of the date of this report, the majority of our global workforce continues to work from home.  The heightened security risks presented by widespread remote access to our computer systems, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.  For further discussion of risks associated with the operation of our business functions, facilities and systems and our vendors' facilities and systems, see the Risk Factor, “Any significant interruption in the operation of our business functions, facilities and systems or our vendors' facilities and systems could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.”  For further discussion of risks associated with information security, see the Risk Factor, “Any significant breach in our data security infrastructure could disrupt business, cause financial losses and damage our reputation.”In addition, in virtually all cases, our critical vendors have also had to impose workplace restrictions or work from home mandates on their employees, which may result in interruption in service delivery or failure by vendors to properly perform required services, including delivery in a manner more susceptible to significant information security risk.  Such vendor issues may result in a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the extent of which cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.  For further discussion of risks associated with vendors and third party service providers, see the Risk Factors
, “Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on our behalf could result in a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition” and “Loss of key vendor relationships and issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could compromise our ability to conduct business.” Insurance RisksIf we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date.  The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain.  These variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events.  Key variables include frequency of claims, claim severity, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as workers' compensation, general liability and professional liability, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled.  The impact of changes in inflation and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.  Certain risks and uncertainties associated with our insurance reserves are outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties sections of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition 9Table of Contentsby either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict and may be material.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, we continually review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.  If our recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Our actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.Our active life reserves for long term care policies are based on our best estimate assumptions as of September 30, 2020, due to a reserve unlocking at that date.  Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases. Estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain because the adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and our future expectations related to these key assumptions.  If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring us to add reserves.  The required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.  See the Life & Group Policyholder Reserves portion of Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.Morbidity and persistency experience, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.A prolonged period during which investment returns remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to our reserves.  This risk is more significant for our long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets.  Further, changes to the Internal Revenue Code may also affect the rate at which we discount our reserves.  In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases we request.  Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves.We are vulnerable to material losses from natural and man-made disasters.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses.  These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil unrest, cyber attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance coverage, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any.  It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Further, significant catastrophic events or a series of catastrophic events have the potential to impose financial stress on the reinsurance industry, which could impact our ability to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, thereby resulting in higher net incurred losses. 10Table of ContentsReinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  Our principal reinsurance protection against these large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA through December 31, 2027.  However, such coverage is subject to a mandatory deductible and other limitations.  It is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure.  For a further discussion of TRIPRA, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Catastrophes and Related Reinsurance.As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate, could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance.  Accordingly, catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer as of December 31, 2020 is $3.3 billion.  If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.  Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO.  Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce our earnings.We are exposed to, and may face adverse developments related to, mass tort claims that could arise from our insureds’ sale or use of potentially harmful products or substances, changes to the social and legal environment, issues related to altered interpretation of coverage and other new and emerging claim theories.We face potential exposure to various types of new and emerging mass tort claims, including those related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances such as glyphosate, lead paint and opioids; claims arising from changes that expand the right to sue, remove limitations on recovery, extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms, such as those related to abuse reviver statutes, including New York reviver statutes; and claims related to new and emerging theories of liability, such as those related to global warming and climate change.  Evolving judicial interpretations and new legislation regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liability, as well as the application of insurance coverage to these claims, give rise to new claimant activity.  Emerging mass tort claim activity, including activity based on such changing judicial interpretations and recent and proposed legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 11Table of ContentsWe may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, which could result in increased exposure to risk or a decrease in our underwriting commitments.  A primary reason we purchase reinsurance is to manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, we may have increased exposure to risk, which could be material.  Alternatively, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk, which would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.  Strategic RisksWe face intense competition in our industry; we may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business and the evolving landscape of our distribution network.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services to remain competitive.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than we do, for both distributors and customers.  This includes agents, brokers and managing general underwriters who may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets continue to provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk.  Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, such as insurtech firms, resulting in increased pressures on our ability to remain competitive, particularly in obtaining pricing that is both attractive to our customer base and risk-appropriate to us.In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.We market our insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance brokers, and managing general underwriters who also promote and distribute the products of our competitors.  Any change in our relationships with our distribution network agents, brokers or managing general underwriters, including as a result of consolidation and their increased promotion and distribution of our competitors' products, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.  As a result, our business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.We may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and our ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks.  For example, more insurers are utilizing ""big data"" analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing.  If such utilization is more effective than how we use similar data and information, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies, or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.  For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact our competitive position.  Our efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely 12Table of Contentsimpact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.  We face considerable competition within our industry for qualified, specialized talent and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies.The successful execution of our business plan depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent.  Due to the intense competition in our industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized knowledge and industry experience in areas such as underwriting, data and analytics and technology, we may encounter obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are controlled by a single stockholder which could result in potential conflicts of interest.Loews beneficially owned approximately 89.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020, and is in a position to control actions that require the consent of stockholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and any merger or sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, five officers of Loews currently serve on our Board of Directors. We have also entered into services agreements and a registration rights agreement with Loews, and we may in the future enter into other agreements with Loews.  It is possible that potential conflicts of interest could arise in the future for our directors who are also officers of Loews with respect to a number of areas relating to the past and ongoing relationships of Loews and us, including tax and insurance matters, financial commitments and sales of common stock pursuant to registration rights or otherwise.Financial RisksWe may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.  Our investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid.  The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the portion of our investment portfolio that is carried at fair value in our financial statements is not reflective of the prices at which actual transactions could occur.We have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity investments, which could reduce our net unrealized gains included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).  The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold or in the underlying collateral of the security.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in limited partnerships and common stock which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments which may also limit our ability to withdraw funds from these investments.  The timing and amount of income or losses on such investments is inherently variable and can contribute to volatility in reported earnings.Further, we hold a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.  We are subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral, refinancing risk and the creditworthiness of tenants of credit tenant loan properties, 13Table of Contentswhere lease payments directly service the loan.  Any changes in actual or expected collections would result in a charge to earnings.  As a result of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may be required to write-down the value of our investments and may incur losses on the disposition of our investments all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Operational RisksWe use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities.  This includes both proprietary and third party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things.  We incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others.  The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary models and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis.  Further, climate change may make modeled outcomes less certain or produce new, non-modeled risks.In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks, including the improper use of the model, input errors, data errors and human error.  As a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results.  The profitability and financial condition of the Company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs.  If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.Any significant interruption in the operation of our business functions, facilities and systems or our vendors' facilities and systems could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations.  Our or our vendors' facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics or pandemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure, interruption or corruption of one or more of our or our vendors' information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures or interruptions that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our or our vendors' systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis.  In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions, including the ability to issue financial statements in a timely manner. The foregoing risks could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  Potential exposures include substantially increased compliance costs and required computer system upgrades and security-related 14Table of Contentsinvestments.  If our business continuity plans or system security does not sufficiently address these risks, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Any significant breach in our data security infrastructure could disrupt business, cause financial losses and damage our reputation.A significant breach of our data security infrastructure may result from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators, or unknown third parties or through cyber attacks.  Such a breach could affect our data framework or cause a failure to protect the personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, or sensitive and confidential information regarding our business and may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.  The risk of a breach could increase as vendors increasingly offer cloud-based software services rather than software services which can be run within our data centers or as we choose to move additional functions to the cloud.The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws, as well as evolving regulation in this regard.  Any such legal or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on our behalf could result in a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may incur losses which arise from employees or third party service providers engaging in intentional, negligent or inadvertent misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.  Our or our third party service providers' controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of such non-compliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.  Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Portions of our insurance business is underwritten and serviced by third parties.  With respect to underwriting, our contractual arrangements with third parties will typically grant them limited rights to write new and renewal policies, subject to contractual restrictions and obligations, including requiring them to underwrite within the terms of our licenses.  Should these third parties issue policies that exceed these contractual restrictions, we could be deemed liable for such policies and subject to regulatory fines and penalties for any breach of licensing requirements.  It is possible that in such circumstance we might not be fully indemnified for such third parties’ contractual breaches.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of our long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We have also licensed certain systems from third parties.  We cannot be certain that we will have access to these systems or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended.These risks could adversely impact our reputation and client relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Loss of key vendor relationships and issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could compromise our ability to conduct business.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may be adversely affected.  We may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties, failure by vendors to properly perform service functions or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.  Our inability to provide for appropriate servicing if a vendor becomes unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to 15Table of Contentsus, either through transitioning to another service provider temporarily or permanently or assuming servicing internally, may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  In the U.S., these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction's regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves or the occurrence of a catastrophic event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates our capital position, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.The IAIS has adopted a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups and continues to develop a group basis Insurance Capital Standard (ICS).  The NAIC is also developing a group capital standard that is intended to be comparable to the ICS.  The development and adoption of these capital standards could increase our prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase our cost of regulatory compliance.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator, are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, we may not be able to fund our corporate obligations and debt service requirements or pay our stockholders dividends from available cash.  As a result, we would need to pursue other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us, thereby adversely affecting our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all and increasing our cost of capital.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.The rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.  Further, if one or more of our corporate debt ratings were downgraded, we may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs.In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse effect on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.  16Table of ContentsFor further discussion of our ratings, see the Ratings subsection within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business.  Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible or restrict us from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.17Table of Contents"
0,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2020-02-11,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.  We have described below the most significant risks that we face.  There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be as significant that may also affect our business.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.If we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date.  The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain.  These variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events.  Key variables include frequency of claims, claim severity, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability and workers' compensation, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled.  The impact of changes in inflation and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.  Certain risks and uncertainties associated with our insurance reserves are outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties sections of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, we continually review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.  If our recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Our actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.Our active life reserves for long term care policies are based on our best estimate assumptions as of September 30, 2019, due to a reserve unlocking at that date.  Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases.  These assumptions, which are critical bases for our reserve estimates, are inherently uncertain.  If actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, we may be required to increase our reserves.  See the Life & Group Policyholder Reserves portion of Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.6Table of ContentsEstimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain because the adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and our future expectations related to these key assumptions.  If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring us to add reserves.  The required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Morbidity and persistency experience, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to our reserves.  This risk is more significant for our long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets.  Further, changes to the Internal Revenue Code may also affect the rate at which we discount our reserves.  In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases we request.  Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves.We are vulnerable to material losses from natural and man-made disasters.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses.  These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion, cyber attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance coverage, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any.  It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  Our principal reinsurance protection against these large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA through December 31, 2027.  However, such coverage is subject to a mandatory deductible and other limitations.  It is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure.  For a further discussion of TRIPRA, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Catastrophes and Related Reinsurance.As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.  Additionally, catastrophic events could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance.  We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  7Table of ContentsOn August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer as of December 31, 2019 is $3.2 billion.  If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.  Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO.  Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce our earnings.We are exposed to, and may face adverse developments related to, mass tort claims that could arise from our insureds’ sale or use of potentially harmful products or substances, changes to the social and legal environment, issues related to altered interpretation of coverage and other new and emerging claim theories.We face potential exposure to various types of new and emerging mass tort claims, including, but not limited to, those related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances such as glyphosate, lead paint and opioids; claims arising from changes that expand the right to sue, remove limitations on recovery, extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms, such as those related to abuse reviver statutes; and claims related to new and emerging theories of liability, such as those related to global warming and climate change.  Evolving judicial interpretations and new legislation regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liability, as well as the application of insurance coverage to these claims, give rise to new claimant activity.  Emerging mass tort claim activity, including activity based on such changing judicial interpretations and recent and proposed legislation, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities.  This includes both proprietary and third party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things.  We incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others.  The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary models and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis. In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks including, but not limited to, the improper use of the model, including input errors, data errors and human error.  As a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results.  The profitability and financial condition of the Company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs.  If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be materially adversely affected.8Table of ContentsWe face intense competition in our industry; we may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business and the evolving landscape of our distribution network.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services to remain competitive.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than we do, for both distributors and customers.  This includes agents, brokers and managing general underwriters who may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets continue to provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk.  Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, resulting in increased pressures on our ability to remain competitive, particularly in obtaining pricing that is both attractive to our customer base and risk-appropriate to us.In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.We market our insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance brokers, and managing general underwriters who also promote and distribute the products of our competitors.  Any change in our relationships with our distribution network agents, brokers or managing general underwriters including as a result of consolidation and their increased promotion and distribution of our competitors' products, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.  As a result, our business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.We may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and our ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks.  For example, more insurers are utilizing ""big data"" analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing.  If such utilization is more effective than how we use similar data and information, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly, this may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies, or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.  For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact our competitive position.  Our efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.  We may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, which could result in increased exposure to risk or a decrease in our underwriting commitments.  A primary reason we purchase reinsurance is to manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, we may have increased exposure to risk.  Alternatively, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.  9Table of ContentsWe may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefit reserves.  The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims.  As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  Certain of our reinsurance carriers could experience credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of our contractual relationship, which would indicate an increase in the likelihood that we would not be able to recover amounts due.  In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us.  If the amounts collected from reinsurers, including any collateral, are less than the amounts recorded by us, our net incurred losses will be higher.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by policyholders who hold deductible policies and/or who purchase retrospectively rated policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.A portion of our business is written under deductible policies.  Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant.  Moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period).  Retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium, which may be significant.  As a result, we are exposed to policyholder credit risk.  If the amounts collected from policyholders, including any collateral, are less than the amounts recorded by us, our net incurred losses will be higher.We may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.We have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity investments, which could reduce our net unrealized gains included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).  The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold or in the underlying collateral of the security.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments which may also limit our ability to withdraw funds from these investments.  The timing and amount of income or losses on such investments is inherently variable and can contribute to volatility in reported earnings.Further, we hold a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.  We are subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral, refinancing risk and the creditworthiness of tenants of credit tenant loan properties, where lease payments directly service the loan.  Collecting amounts from borrowers that are less than the amounts recorded would result in a charge to our earnings.As a result of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may be required to write-down the value of our investments and may incur losses on the disposition of our investments all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.10Table of ContentsChanges in tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our results of operations.Federal, state or foreign tax legislation that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax attributes currently affecting us could adversely impact our results of operations.  Other potential tax law changes, including further modification of the Federal corporate tax rate and the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the rate at which we discount certain reserves.Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations.  Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis.  In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions, including the ability to issue financial statements in a timely manner.  This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.The foregoing risks could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  Potential exposures include substantially increased compliance costs and required computer system upgrades and security-related investments.  Any significant breach in our data security infrastructure could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.A significant breach of our data security infrastructure may result from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators or by unknown third parties.  Such a breach could affect our data framework or cause a failure to protect the personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, or sensitive and confidential information regarding our business and may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.  The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws, as well as evolving regulation in this regard.  Any such legal or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on our behalf could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.We may incur losses which arise from employees or third party service providers engaging in intentional misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.  Our controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of employee and third party service provider non-compliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.  Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect our results of operations.11Table of ContentsPortions of our insurance business is underwritten and serviced by third parties.  With respect to underwriting, our contractual arrangements with third parties will typically grant them limited rights to write new and renewal policies, subject to contractual restrictions and obligations and requiring them to underwrite within the terms of our licenses.  Should these third parties issue policies that exceed these contractual restrictions, we could be deemed liable for such policies and subject to regulatory fines and penalties for any breach of licensing requirements.  It is possible that in such circumstance we might not be fully indemnified for such third parties’ contractual breaches.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of our long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We have also licensed certain systems from third parties.  We cannot be certain that we will have access to these systems or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended.These risks could adversely impact our reputation or client relationships or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Loss of key vendor relationships and issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may be adversely affected.  We may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties, failure by vendors to properly perform service functions or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.  Our inability to provide for appropriate servicing if a vendor becomes unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, either through transitioning to another service provider temporarily or permanently or assuming servicing internally, may have a materially adverse effect on our operations.We face considerable competition within our industry for qualified, specialized talent and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies.The successful execution of our business plan depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent.  Due to the intense competition in our industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized knowledge and industry experience in areas such as underwriting, data and analytics and technology, we may encounter obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We are controlled by a single stockholder which could result in potential conflicts of interest.Loews beneficially owned approximately 89% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2019, and is in a position to control actions that require the consent of stockholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and any merger or sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, five officers of Loews currently serve on our Board of Directors. We have also entered into services agreements and a registration rights agreement with Loews, and we may in the future enter into other agreements with Loews.  It is possible that potential conflicts of interest could arise in the future for our directors who are also officers of Loews with respect to a number of areas relating to the past and ongoing relationships of Loews and us, including tax and insurance matters, financial commitments and sales of common stock pursuant to registration rights or otherwise.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  In the U.S., these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable 12Table of Contentsjurisdiction's regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves, the occurrence of a catastrophic event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates our capital position, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.The IAIS recently adopted a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups and continues to develop a group basis Insurance Capital Standard (ICS).  The NAIC is also developing a group capital standard that is intended to be comparable to the ICS.  The development and adoption of these capital standards could increase our prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase our cost of regulatory compliance.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator, are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, we may not be able to fund our corporate obligations and debt service requirements or pay our stockholders dividends from available cash.  As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.The rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse effect on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on our business, our operations and financial condition.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business.  Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.13Table of ContentsThese rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible or restrict us from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.Changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.We are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).  It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  For a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.14Table of Contents"
1,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2019-02-13,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.  We have described below the most significant risks that we face.  There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be as significant that may also affect our business.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.If we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date.  The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain.  These variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events.  Key variables include frequency of claims, claim severity, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability and workers' compensation, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled.  The impact of changes in inflation and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.  Certain risks and uncertainties associated with our insurance reserves are outlined in the Critical Accounting Estimates and the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties sections of MD&A in Item 7.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, we continually review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.  If our recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Our actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.Our active life reserves for long term care policies are based on our best estimate assumptions as of December 31, 2015, due to a reserve unlocking at that date.  Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases.  These assumptions, which are critical bases for our reserve estimates, are inherently uncertain.  If actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, we may be required to increase our reserves.  See the Life & Group Policyholder Reserves portion of Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.6Table of ContentsEstimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain, because the required projection period is very long and there is limited claim history.  Morbidity and persistency experience, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to our reserves.  This risk is more significant for our long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets.  Further, changes to the corporate tax code may also affect the rate at which we discount our reserves.  In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases we request.  Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves.If our estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Catastrophe and systemic losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses.  These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion, cyber attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance coverage, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any.  It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.  Additionally, catastrophic events could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance.  Claim frequency and severity for some lines of business can be correlated to external factors such as economic activity, financial market volatility, increasing health care costs or changes in the legal or regulatory environment.  Claim frequency and severity can also be correlated to insureds' use of common business practices, equipment, vendors or software.  This can result in multiple insured losses emanating out of the same underlying cause.  In these instances, we may be subject to increased claim frequency and severity across multiple policies or lines of business concurrently.  While we do not define such systemic losses as catastrophes for financial reporting purposes, they are similar to catastrophes in terms of the uncertainty and potential impact on our results.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy 7Table of ContentsA&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer as of December 31, 2018 is $3.1 billion.  If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.  Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO.  Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce our earnings.We use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities.  This includes both proprietary and third party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things.  We incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others.  The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary models and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including those arising from the use of historical internal and industry data and assumptions.  In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks including, but not limited to, the improper use of the model, including input errors, data errors and human error.  As a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results.  The profitability and financial condition of the Company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs.  If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We face intense competition in our industry; we may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business and the evolving landscape of our distribution network.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services to remain competitive.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than we do, for both distributors and customers.  This includes agents, brokers and managing general underwriters who may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets continue to provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk.  Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, resulting in increased pressures on our ability to remain competitive, particularly in obtaining pricing that is both attractive to our customer base and risk-appropriate to us.  In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.We market our insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance brokers, and managing general underwriters who also promote and distribute the products of our competitors.  Any change in our relationships with our distribution network agents, brokers or managing general underwriters including as 8Table of Contentsa result of consolidation and their increased promotion and distribution of our competitors' products, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.  As a result, our business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.  We may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and our ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks.  For example, more insurers are utilizing ""big data"" analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing.  If such utilization is more effective than how we use similar data and information, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly, this may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies, or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.  For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact our competitive position.  Our efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.  We may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, which could result in increased exposure to risk or a decrease in our underwriting commitments.  A primary reason we purchase reinsurance is to manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions we deem acceptable, we may have increased exposure to risk.  Alternatively, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.  We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefit reserves.  The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims.  As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  Certain of our reinsurance carriers could experience credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of our contractual relationship, which would indicate an increase in the likelihood that we would not be able to recover amounts due.  In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us.  If the amounts collected from reinsurers, including any collateral, are less than the amounts recorded by us, our net incurred losses will be higher.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by policyholders who hold deductible policies and/or who purchase retrospectively rated policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.A portion of our business is written under deductible policies.  Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant.  Moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period).  Retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium, which may be significant.  As a result, we are exposed to policyholder credit risk.  If the amounts collected from policyholders, including any collateral, are less than the amounts recorded by us, our net incurred losses will be higher.9Table of ContentsWe may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.We have significant holdings in fixed income investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed income investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed income investments.  The value of our fixed income investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold or in the underlying collateral of the security.  Any such impairments which we deem to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to our earnings.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed income investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments which may also limit our ability to withdraw assets.Further, we hold a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.  We are subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral and creditworthiness of tenants of credit tenant loan properties, where lease payments directly service the loan.  Collecting amounts from borrowers that are less than the amounts recorded would result in a charge to our earnings.As a result of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may be required to write down the value of our investments and may incur losses on the disposition of our investments.Changes in tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our results of operations.Federal, state or foreign tax legislation that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax attributes currently affecting us could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, in particular, changes to tax laws governing tax credits.  Other potential tax law changes, including further modification of the corporate tax rate and the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, could also adversely affect the value of the tax benefit received on tax exempt municipal investments and thus the rate at which we discount our long term care active life reserves. Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations.  Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis.  In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and 10Table of Contentsrenewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions, including the ability to issue financial statements in a timely manner.  This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.The foregoing risks could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  Potential exposures include substantially increased compliance costs and required computer system upgrades and security-related investments.  Any significant breach in our data security infrastructure could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.A significant breach of our data security infrastructure may result from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators or by unknown third parties.  Such a breach could affect our data framework or cause a failure to protect the personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, or sensitive and confidential information regarding our business and may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.  The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws, as well as evolving regulation in this regard.  Any such legal or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on our behalf could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.We may incur losses which arise from employees or third party service providers engaging in intentional misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.  Our controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of employee and third party service provider non-compliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.  Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect our results of operations.Portions of our insurance business is underwritten and serviced by third parties.  With respect to underwriting, our contractual arrangements with third parties will typically grant them limited rights to write new and renewal policies, subject to contractual restrictions and obligations and requiring them to underwrite within the terms of our licenses.  Should these third parties issue policies that exceed these contractual restrictions, we could be deemed liable for such policies and subject to regulatory fines and penalties for any breach of licensing requirements.  It is possible that in such circumstance we might not be fully indemnified for such third parties’ contractual breaches.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of our long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We have also licensed certain systems from third parties.  We cannot be certain that we will have access to these systems or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended.These risks could adversely impact our reputation or client relationships or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Loss of key vendor relationships and issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may be adversely affected.  We may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties, failure by vendors to properly perform service functions or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.  Our inability to provide for appropriate servicing if a vendor becomes unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, either through transitioning to another service provider temporarily or permanently or assuming servicing internally, may have a materially adverse effect on our operations.11Table of ContentsWe face considerable competition within our industry for qualified, specialized talent and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies.The successful execution of our business plan depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent.  Due to the intense competition in our industry for qualified employees with specialized industry experience, we may encounter obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.We are controlled by a single stockholder which could result in potential conflicts of interest.Loews beneficially owned approximately 89% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2018, and is in a position to control actions that require the consent of stockholders, including the election of directors, amendment of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and any merger or sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, four officers of Loews currently serve on our Board of Directors. We have also entered into services agreements and a registration rights agreement with Loews, and we may in the future enter into other agreements with Loews.  It is possible that potential conflicts of interest could arise in the future for our directors who are also officers of Loews with respect to a number of areas relating to the past and ongoing relationships of Loews and us, including tax and insurance matters, financial commitments and sales of common stock pursuant to registration rights or otherwise.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  In the U.S., these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction's regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves, the occurrence of a catastrophic event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates our capital position, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.Globally, insurance regulators are working cooperatively to develop a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups that includes an International Capital Standard (ICS) that may need to be implemented on a group basis.  Finalization and adoption of this framework, including the ICS, could increase our prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase our cost of regulatory compliance. Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator, are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, we may not be able to fund our corporate obligations and debt service requirements or pay our stockholders dividends from available cash.  As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).  Ratings reflect the rating 12Table of Contentsagency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.The rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse effect on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on our business, our operations and financial condition.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business.  Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible or restrict us from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.Changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.We are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).  It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  For a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.13Table of Contents"
13,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2018-02-14,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.  We have described below the most significant risks facing us.  There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be as significant that may also affect our business.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.If we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date.  The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain.  These variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events.  Key variables include claim severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability and workers' compensation, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled.  The impact of changes in inflation and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict.Emerging or potential claim and coverage issues include, but are not limited to, uncertainty in future medical costs in workers' compensation.  In particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and devices; increased healthcare utilization; and/or the future costs of healthcare facilities.  In addition, the relationship between workers' compensation and government and private healthcare providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers' compensation.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, we continually review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.  If our recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Our actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.Our active life reserves for long term care policies are based on our best estimate assumptions as of December 31, 2015, due to an unlocking at that date.  Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases.  These assumptions, which are critical bases for our reserve estimates, are inherently uncertain.  If actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, we may be required to increase our reserves.  See the Life & Group 6Table of ContentsPolicyholder Reserves portion of Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.Estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain, because the required projection period is very long and there is limited historical and industry data available to us, as only a small portion of the long term care policies which have been written to date are in claims paying status.  Morbidity and persistency trends, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to our reserves.  This risk is more significant for our long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. Further, changes to the corporate tax code may also affect the rate at which we discount our reserves.  In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases we request.  Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves.If our estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Catastrophe and systemic losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses.  These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion, cyber attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any.  It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.  Additionally, catastrophic events could cause us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance.  Claim frequency and severity for some lines of business can be correlated to an external factor such as economic activity, financial market volatility, increasing health care costs or changes in the legal or regulatory environment.  Claim frequency and severity can also be correlated to insureds' use of common business practices, equipment, vendors or software.  This can result in multiple insured losses emanating out of the same underlying cause.  In these instances, we may be subject to increased claim frequency and severity across multiple policies or lines of business concurrently.  While we do not define such systemic losses as catastrophes for financial reporting purposes, they are similar to catastrophes in terms of the uncertainty and potential impact on our results.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial 7Table of Contentsmethods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer as of December 31, 2017 is $2.9 billion.  If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.  Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO.  Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce our earnings.We use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities.  This includes both proprietary and third party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things.  We incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others.  The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including those arising from the use of historical internal and industry data and assumptions.  In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks including, but not limited to, the improper use of the model, including input errors, data errors and human error.  As a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results.  The profitability and financial condition of the Company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs.  If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.We face intense competition in our industry; we may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business and the evolving landscape of our distribution network.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services to remain competitive.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than we do, for both distributors and customers.  This includes agents and brokers who may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets continue to provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk.  Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, resulting in increased pressures on our ability to remain competitive, particularly in implementing pricing that is both attractive to our customer base and risk-appropriate to us.  In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.8Table of ContentsWe market our insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents and insurance brokers, who also promote and distribute the products of our competitors.  Any change in our relationships with our distribution network agents and brokers, including as a result of consolidation and their increased promotion and distribution of our competitors' products, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.  As a result, our business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.  We may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and our ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks.  For example, more insurers are utilizing ""big data"" analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing.  If such utilization is more effective than how we use similar data and information, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.  There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly, this may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies, or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.  For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact our competitive position.  Our efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.  We may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, which could result in increased exposure to risk or a decrease in our underwriting commitments.  We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may have increased exposure to risk.  Alternatively, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.  We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefit reserves.  The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims.  As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  Certain of our reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of our contractual relationship, which indicates an increase in the likelihood that we will not be able to recover amounts due.  In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us.  If the amounts due from reinsurers that we are able to collect are less than the amount recorded by us with respect to such amounts due, our net incurred losses will be higher.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by policyholders who hold deductible policies and/or who purchase retrospectively rated policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.A portion of our business is written under deductible policies.  Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant. Moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period).  Retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium, which may be significant.  As a result, we are exposed to policyholder 9Table of Contentscredit risk.  If the amounts due from policyholders that we are able to collect are less than the amounts recorded with respect to such amounts due, our incurred losses will be higher.We may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.We have significant holdings in fixed income investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed income investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed income investments.  The value of our fixed income investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold or in the underlying collateral of the security.  Any such impairments which we deem to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to our earnings.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed income investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments which may also limit our ability to withdraw assets.Further, we hold a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.  We are subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral and creditworthiness of tenants of credit tenant loan properties, where lease payments directly service the loan.  Collecting amounts from borrowers that are less than the amounts recorded would result in a charge to our earnings.As a result of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may be required to write down the value of our investments and may incur losses on the disposition of our investments.Changes in tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our results of operations.Federal, state or foreign tax legislation that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax attributes currently affecting us could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, in particular, changes to tax laws governing tax credits.  Other potential tax law changes, including further modification of the corporate tax rate and the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, could also adversely affect the value of the tax benefit received on tax exempt municipal investments and thus the rate at which we discount our long term care active life reserves. Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations.  Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis.  In addition, because our information technology 10Table of Contentsand telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions, including the ability to issue financial statements in a timely manner.  This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.The foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  In addition, potential exposures include substantially increased compliance costs and required computer system upgrades and security-related investments.  Any significant breach in our data security infrastructure could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.A significant breach of our data security infrastructure may result from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators or by unknown third parties.  Such a breach could affect our data framework or cause a failure to protect the personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, or sensitive and confidential information regarding our business and may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.  The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws, as well as evolving regulation in this regard, including the recently issued New York Department of Financial Services cyber regulation.  Any such legal or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct or inadvertent errors and omissions could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.We may incur losses which arise from employees or third party service providers engaging in intentional misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.  Our controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of employee and third party service provider non-compliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.  Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect our results of operations.Loss of key vendor relationships, issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships or exposure relating to functions performed by a vendor could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may be adversely affected.  We may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties, failure by vendors to properly perform service functions or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.  Our inability to provide for appropriate servicing if a vendor becomes unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, either through transitioning to another service provider temporarily or permanently or assuming servicing internally, may have a materially adverse effect on our operations.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of our long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We face considerable competition within our industry for qualified, specialized talent and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies.The successful execution of our business plan depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent.  Due to the intense competition in our industry for qualified employees with specialized industry experience, we may encounter obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could adversely affect our results of operations.11Table of ContentsWe are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction's regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves, the occurrence of a catastrophic event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, which severely deteriorate our capital position, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.Globally, insurance regulators are working cooperatively to develop a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups.  Finalization and adoption of this framework could increase our prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase our cost of regulatory compliance. Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator, are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, we may not be able to fund our corporate obligations and debt service requirements from available cash.  As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.The rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse affect on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on our business, our operations and financial condition.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our 12Table of Contentsinvestors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business.  Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible or restrict us from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.13Table of Contents"
6,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2017-02-15,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.  We have described below the most significant risks facing us.  There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be as significant that may also impact our business.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.If we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date.  The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of  factors which are highly uncertain.  These variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events.  Key variables include claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability and workers' compensation, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled.  The impact of changes in inflation and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict.Emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to, uncertainty in future medical costs in workers' compensation.  In particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and devices; increased healthcare utilization; and/or the future costs of healthcare facilities.  In addition, the relationship between workers' compensation and government and private healthcare providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers' compensation.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, we continually review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.  If our recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Our actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.Our active life reserves for long term care policies are based on our best estimate assumptions as of December 31, 2015, due to an unlocking at that date.  Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases.  These assumptions, which are critical bases for our reserve estimates, are inherently uncertain.  If actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, we may be required to increase our reserves.  See the Life & Group Non-6Table of ContentsCore Policyholder Reserves portion of Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.Estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain, because the required projection period is very long and there is limited historical and industry data available to us, as only a small portion of the long term care policies which have been written to date are in claims paying status.  Morbidity and persistency trends can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to our reserves.  This risk is more significant for our long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. Further, changes to the corporate tax code may also impact the rate at which we discount our reserves.  In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases we request.  Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves.If our estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Catastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any.  It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.Additionally, claim frequency and severity for some lines of business can be correlated to an external factor such as economic activity, financial market volatility, increasing health care costs or changes in the legal or regulatory environment.  Claim frequency and severity can also be correlated to insureds' use of common business practices, equipment, vendors or software.  This can result in multiple insured losses emanating out of the same underlying cause.  In these instances, we may be subject to increased claim frequency and severity across multiple policies or lines of business concurrently.  While we do not define such instances as catastrophes for financial reporting purposes, they are similar to catastrophes in terms of the uncertainty and potential impact on our results.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, 7Table of Contentsestimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer as of December 31, 2016 is $2.8 billion. If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.We use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities.  This includes both proprietary and third party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things. We incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others.  The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary and third parties are subject to the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including those arising from the use of historical internal and industry data and assumptions.  In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks including, but not limited to, the improper use of the model, including input errors, data errors and human error. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results.  The profitability and financial condition of the Company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs.  If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.We face intense competition in our industry; we may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business, the evolving landscape of our distribution network, as well as the availability and cost of reinsurance.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services to remain competitive.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than we do, for both distributors and customers.  This includes agents and brokers who may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets continue to provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk.  Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The competitor insurer landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, resulting in increased pressures on our ability to remain competitive, particularly in implementing pricing that is both attractive to our customer base and risk-appropriate to the Company.  In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.We market our insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents and insurance brokers, who also promote and distribute the products of our competitors.  Any change in our relationships with our distribution network agents and brokers, including as a result of consolidation and their increased promotion 8Table of Contentsand distribution of our competitors' products, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.   As a result, our business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.  We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.We may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and our ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks.  For example, more insurers are utilizing ""big data"" analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing.  If such utilization is more effective than how we use similar data and information, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly, this may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies, or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing.  For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact our competitive position.  Our efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources. We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves.  The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims.  As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  Certain of our reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of our contractual relationship, which indicates an increase in the likelihood that we will not be able to recover amounts due.  In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us.  If the amounts due from reinsurers that we are able to collect are less than the amount recorded by us with respect to such amounts due, our net incurred losses will be higher.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by policyholders who hold deductible policies and/or who purchase retrospectively rated policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.A portion of our business is written under deductible policies.  Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant. Moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period). Retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium, which may be significant.  As a result, we are exposed to policyholder credit risk.  If the amounts due from policyholders that we are able to collect are less than the amounts recorded with respect to such amounts due, our incurred losses will be higher.We may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic 9Table of Contentsconditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.We have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity investments.  The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold or in the underlying collateral of the security.  Any such impairments which we deem to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to our earnings.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments which may also limit our ability to withdraw assets.Further, we hold a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.  We are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from the borrowers as a result of the creditworthiness of the borrowers or tenants of credit tenant loan properties.  If the amounts we collect from the borrowers are less than the amount recorded, it would result in a charge to our earnings.As a result of all of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may be required to write down the value of our investments and may incur losses on the disposition of our investments.Changes in tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our results of operations.Federal, state or foreign tax legislation that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax attributes currently affecting us could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, in particular, changes to tax laws governing tax credits.  Other potential tax law changes, including modification of the corporate tax rate and the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, could also adversely affect the value of the tax benefit received on tax exempt municipal investments and thus the rate at which we discount our long term care active life reserves. Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions or breach in our data security infrastructure could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations.  Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis.  In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions, including the ability to issue financial statements in a timely manner.  This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.10Table of ContentsA significant breach of our data security infrastructure, resulting from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators or by unknown third parties, that impacts our data framework or causes a failure to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.The foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  In addition, potential exposures include substantially increased compliance costs and required computer system upgrades and security-related investments.  The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  Any such legal or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct or inadvertent errors and omissions could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.We may incur losses which arise from employees or third party service providers engaging in intentional misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.  Our controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of employee and third party service provider non-compliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.  Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect our results of operations.Loss of key vendor relationships, issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships or exposure relating to functions performed by a vendor could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may be adversely affected.  We may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties, failure by vendors to properly perform service functions or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.  Our inability to provide for appropriate servicing if a vendor becomes unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, either through transitioning to another service provider temporarily or permanently or assuming servicing internally, may have a materially adverse effect on our operations.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of our long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We face considerable competition within our industry for qualified, specialized talent and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies.The successful execution of our business plan depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent. Due to the intense competition in our industry for qualified employees with specialized industry experience, we may encounter obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could adversely impact our results of operations.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction's regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves, the occurrence of a catastrophic  event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, which 11Table of Contentsseverely deteriorate our capital position, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.Globally, insurance regulators are working cooperatively to develop a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups.  Finalization and adoption of this framework could increase our minimum regulatory capital requirement as well as significantly increase our cost of regulatory compliance. Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator, are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, we may not be able to fund our corporate obligations and debt service requirements from available cash.  As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.The rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on our business, our operations and financial condition.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business.  Any changes in regulation could also impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider 12Table of Contentseligible or restrict us from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas.

Morbidity and persistency trends can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, socioeconomic factors, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to our reserves.  This risk is more significant for our long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases we request.  Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves.If our estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Catastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any.  As in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.Additionally, claim frequency and severity for some lines of business can be correlated to an external factor such as economic activity, financial market volatility, increasing health care costs or changes in the legal or regulatory environment.  Claim frequency and severity can also be correlated to insureds' use of common business practices, equipment, vendors or software.  This can result in multiple insured losses emanating out of the same underlying cause.  In these instances, we may be subject to increased claim frequency and severity across multiple policies or lines of business concurrently.  While we do not define such instances as catastrophes for financial reporting purposes, they are similar to catastrophes in terms of the uncertainty and potential impact on our results.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.9Table of ContentsOn August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer as of December 31, 2015 is $2.6 billion. If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.We face intense competition in our industry; we may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business as well as the availability and cost of reinsurance.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers.  Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The competitor insurer landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, resulting in increased pressures on our ability to remain competitive, particularly in implementing pricing that is both attractive to our customer base and risk-appropriate to the Company.  In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.Additionally, we purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves.  The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims.  As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  Certain of our reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of our contractual relationship, which increases the likelihood that we will not be able to recover amounts due.  In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us.  If the amounts we collect from reinsurers are less than the amount recorded for any of the foregoing reasons, our net incurred losses will be higher.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by policyholders who hold deductible policies and/or who purchase retrospectively rated policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.A portion of our business is written under deductible policies.  Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant.  As a result, we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder.  If the amounts we collect from policyholders are less than the amounts recorded, our incurred losses will be higher.Moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period). Retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium.10Table of ContentsWe may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.We have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity investments.  The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold.  Any such impairments which we deem to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to our earnings.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments and therefore may also limit our ability to withdraw assets.  As a result of all of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may be required to write down the value of our investments and may incur losses on the disposition of our investments.Changes in tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our results of operations.Federal, state or foreign tax legislation that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax attributes currently affecting us could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, in particular, changes to tax laws governing tax credits.  Other potential tax law changes, including the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, could also adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions or breach in our data security infrastructure could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations.  Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis.  In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions, including the ability to issue financial statements in a timely manner.  This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.A significant breach of our data security infrastructure, resulting from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators or by unknown third parties, that impacts our data framework or causes a failure to protect 11Table of Contentspersonal information of our customers, claimants or employees may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.  The foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  In addition, potential exposure includes substantially increased compliance costs and requires computer system upgrades and security-related investments.  The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  Any such legal or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Loss of key vendor relationships, issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships or exposure relating to claim administration and claim adjudication functions performed by a vendor could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may be adversely affected.  We may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.  Our inability to provide for appropriate servicing if a vendor becomes unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, either through transitioning to another service provider temporarily or permanently or assuming servicing internally, may have a materially adverse effect on our operations.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of our long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We face considerable competition within our industry for qualified, specialized talent and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies. The successful execution of our business plan depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent. Due to the intense competition in our industry for qualified employees with specialized industry experience, we may encounter obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could adversely impact our results of operations. We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction's regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimate or the occurrence of an event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.Globally, insurance regulators are working cooperatively to develop a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups.  Finalization and adoption of this framework could increase our minimum regulatory capital requirement as well as significantly increase our cost of regulatory compliance.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capital needs, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by 12Table of Contentsthe insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator, are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash.  As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.The rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.We are subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and, accordingly, on our operations.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business, generally at the state level.  Any changes in federal regulation could also impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible or restrict us from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.13Table of Contents"
7,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2015-02-23,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks.  Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.If we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.  Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on our part.  As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in long-tail and long duration coverages, we are sometimes required to add to our reserves.  This is called unfavorable net prior year development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made.  These charges can be substantial.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict.  Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:•uncertainty in future medical costs in workers' compensation.  In particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and devices; increased healthcare utilization; and/or the future costs of healthcare facilities.  In addition, the relationship between workers' compensation and government and private healthcare providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers' compensation;•increased uncertainty related to medical professional liability, medical products liability and workers’ compensation coverages resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;•significant class action litigation; and•mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled.  If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.8Table of ContentsOur key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies could vary significantly from actual experience.Our reserves for long term care policies are based on key assumptions including morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future rate increases.  These assumptions, which are critical bases for our reserve estimates, are inherently uncertain.  If actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, we may be required to increase our reserves.Estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain because the required projection period is very long and there is limited historical data and industry data available to us, as only a small portion of the long term care policies which have been written to date are in claims paying status.  Morbidity and persistency trends can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, overall population mortality trends, advances in medical care and voluntary lapse experience.A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to our reserves.  This risk is more significant for long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets.  In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the rate increases we request.  Any adverse deviation of future rate increases approved relative to our reserving assumptions may require an increase to our reserves. If our estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Catastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded and reinsurance reinstatement premiums, if any.  As in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  As a result, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.  The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted on January 12, 2015.  The reauthorization provides for a federal government backstop for insured terrorism risks for another six years with increases to the insurer co-payment and program trigger.  The existence of the mitigating effects of such law is part of the analysis of our overall risk posture for terrorism and, accordingly, our risk positioning may change if such law were modified. We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.9Table of ContentsOn August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  The cumulative amount ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer at December 31, 2014 is $2.5 billion. If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, our liabilities for A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.We face intense competition in our industry and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business as well as the availability and cost of reinsurance.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers.  Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.Additionally, we purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves.  The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims.  As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  Certain of our reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of our contractual relationship.  Such action increases the likelihood that we will not be able to recover amounts due.  In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us.  If the amounts we collect from reinsurers are less than the amount recorded for any of the foregoing reasons, our net incurred losses will be higher.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by policyholders who hold deductible policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.A portion of our business is written under deductible policies.  Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant.  As a result, we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder.  If the amounts we collect from policyholders are less than the amounts recorded, our incurred losses will be higher.We may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity and currency, many of which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity and currency prices and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.10Table of ContentsWe have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity investments.  The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold.  Any such impairments which we deem to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to our earnings.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments and therefore may also limit our ability to withdraw assets.  As a result of all of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may incur losses on the disposition of our investments and may be required to write down the value of our investments.Our valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment, which is inherently uncertain.We exercise significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values, which are primarily provided by third parties, for securities in our investment portfolio, including those that are not regularly traded in active markets.  We also exercise significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary.  The valuation of residential and commercial mortgage and other asset-backed securities can be particularly sensitive to small changes in collateral performance.Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these judgments, we may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other-than-temporary write downs of our investments are required.Changes in tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our results of operations.Federal, state or foreign tax legislation that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax attributes currently affecting us could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, in particular, changes to tax laws governing tax credits.  Other potential tax law changes, including the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, could also adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions or breach in our data security infrastructure could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations.  Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis.  In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions, including the ability to issue financial statements in a timely manner.  This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.11Table of ContentsA significant breach of our data security infrastructure, resulting from actions by our employees, vendors, third-party administrators or by unknown third parties, that impacts our data framework or causes a failure to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.  The foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could expose us to monetary and reputational damages.  In addition, potential exposure includes substantially increased compliance costs and computer system upgrading and security-related investments.  The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  Any such legal or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Loss of key vendor relationships, issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships or exposure relating to claim administration and claim adjudication functions performed by a vendor could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrator of our long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We face considerable competition within our industry for qualified personnel and any significant inability to attract and retain talent may adversely affect the execution of our business strategies. The successful execution of our business plan depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent. Due to the intense competition in our industry for qualified employees with industry experience, we may encounter significant obstacles to our ability to attract and retain such employees, which could adversely impact our results of operations. We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of statutory capital and surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimate or the occurrence of an event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capital needs, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by jurisdiction.  If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash.  As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.12Table of ContentsRating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.The rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.We are subject to extensive existing state, local and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business, generally at the state level.  Any changes in federal regulation could also impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the following:•standards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements;•restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;•restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas;•the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;•the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;•potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;•licensing of insurers and agents;•approval of policy forms;•limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and•limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel, increase rates or change terms and conditions in policies.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.13Table of Contents"
2,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2014-02-19,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks.  Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.If we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves which would result in a charge to our earnings.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted.  Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on our part.  As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, we are sometimes required to add to our reserves.  This is called unfavorable net prior year development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made.  These charges can be substantial.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict.  Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:•uncertainty in future medical costs in workers' compensation.  In particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs, and devices; increased healthcare utilization; and/or the future costs of healthcare facilities.  In addition, the relationship between workers' compensation and government and private healthcare providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers' compensation;•increased uncertainty related to medical professional liability, medical products liability and workers’ compensation coverages resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;•significant class action litigation; and•mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals, and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled.  If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.8Table of ContentsOur key assumptions used to determine reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts could vary significantly from actual experience.Our reserves for long term care products are based on key assumptions including morbidity, mortality, policy persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force) and discount rate.  These assumptions are critical bases for reserve estimates and, while monitored consistently, are inherently uncertain due to the limited historical data and industry data available to us, as only a small portion of the long term care policies which have been written to date are in claims paying status, and the potential changing trends in morbidity and mortality over time.  Assumptions relating to mortality and discount rate also form the basis for reserve determination for payout annuity products.A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies and payout annuity contracts, which may also require changes to our reserves.  This risk is more significant for long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets.  If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Catastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion, and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded, and reinsurance reinstatement premiums, if any.  As in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  As a result, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.  Additionally, the U.S. government currently provides financial protection through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which is set to expire December 31, 2014.  Should that act expire without reauthorization or be reauthorized under materially different terms, our net exposure to a significant terrorist event could increase.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, our liabilities for A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.9Table of ContentsOur premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves.  The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims.  As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  In the past, certain of our reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of our contractual relationship.  Such action increases the likelihood that we will not be able to recover amounts due.  In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us.  If the amounts we collect from reinsurers are less than the amount recorded for any of the foregoing reasons, our net incurred losses will be higher.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by policyholders who hold deductible policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.A portion of our business is written under deductible policies.  Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant.  As a result we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder.  If we are not able to collect the amounts due to us from policyholders, our incurred losses will be higher.We may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, equity, and currency risks, many of which are unpredictable.  Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors.  Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity and currency prices, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the realization of investment income.We have significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing our net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of our existing fixed maturity investments.  The value of our fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments we hold.  Any such impairments which we deem to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to our earnings.In addition, we invest a portion of our assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed maturity investments.  Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments and therefore may also limit our ability to withdraw assets.  As a result of all of these factors, we may not earn an adequate return on our investments, may incur losses on the disposition of our investments, and may be required to write down the value of our investments.Our valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment, which is inherently uncertain.We exercise significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values, which are primarily provided by third parties, for securities in our investment portfolio, including those that are not regularly traded in active markets.  We also exercise significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary.  The valuation of residential and commercial mortgage and other asset-backed securities can be particularly sensitive to fairly small changes in collateral performance.10Table of ContentsDue to the inherent uncertainties involved with these judgments, we may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other-than-temporary write downs of our investments are required.Changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our results of operations.Federal and/or state tax legislation that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax attributes currently affecting us could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, in particular, changes to tax laws governing tax credits.  Other potential tax law changes, including the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, could also adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the rate at which we discount certain liabilities.Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations.  Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities.  Likewise, we could experience a significant failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis.  In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions, including the ability to issue financial statements in a timely manner.  This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.Failure to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, loss of key vendor relationships or exposure relating to claim administration and claim adjudication functions performed by a vendor could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.If a vendor, third-party administrator or employee fails to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to our reputation.In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy, is sold to another entity, sustains a significant business interruption or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses associated with transferring business to a new vendor, assisting a vendor with rectifying operational difficulties or assuming previously outsourced operations ourselves.Additionally, we rely on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrator of our long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions.  Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against us and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.We face intense competition in our industry and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers.  Insurers compete on the basis of factors including 11Table of Contentsproducts, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as ours are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of statutory capital and surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimate or the occurrence of an event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capital needs, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by jurisdiction.  The formula for the majority of domestic states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment.  Some jurisdictions, including certain domestic states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year's earned surplus.  If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash.  As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.Due to the intense competitive environment in which we operate, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for us to take material unfavorable net prior year development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.12Table of ContentsWe are subject to extensive existing state, local and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders and third-party claimants, rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business, generally at the state level.  Any changes in federal regulation could also impose significant burdens on us.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the following:•standards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements;•restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;•restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas;•the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;•the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;•potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;•licensing of insurers and agents;•approval of policy forms;•limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and•limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel, increase rates or change terms and conditions in policies.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.13Table of Contents"

Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.If we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, we may need to increase our insurance reserves.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits.  Reserves represent our best estimate at a given point in time.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted.  Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on our part.  As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, we are sometimes required to add to our reserves.  This is called unfavorable net prior year development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made.  These charges can be substantial.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change.  These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves.  The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict.  Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:•the effects of worldwide economic conditions, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of certain claims, including both directors and officers (D&O) and errors and omissions (E&O) insurance claims related to corporate failures, as well as other coverages;•class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices; and•mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to welding rods, benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals, and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled.  If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.8Table of ContentsOur key assumptions used to determine reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts could vary significantly from actual experience.Our reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity, mortality, policy persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force) and discount rates (which are impacted by expected investment yields).  A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving may result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting policy obligations, which may require changes to reserves.  These assumptions, while based on historical data and industry experience and monitored consistently, are critical bases for reserve estimates and are inherently uncertain.  If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.Catastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, and acts of terrorism.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded, and reinsurance reinstatement premiums, if any.  As in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  As a result, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.As our claim experience develops on a specific catastrophe, we may be required to adjust our reserves, or take unfavorable net prior year development, to reflect our revised estimates of the total cost of claims.We have exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (A&EP) claims, which could result in material losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability. On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, our liabilities for A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.Our premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient 9Table of Contentsreinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves.  The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims.  As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  In the past, certain of our reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of our contractual relationship.  Such action increases the likelihood that we will not be able to recover amounts due.  In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us.  If we are not able to collect the amounts due to us from reinsurers for any of the foregoing reasons, our net incurred losses will be higher.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by policyholders who hold deductible policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses. A portion of our business is written under deductible policies.  Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant.  As a result we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder.  If we are not able to collect the amounts due to us from policyholders, our incurred losses will be higher.We have incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from volatility in the capital and credit markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and currency risks, many of which are unpredictable.  Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability.  General economic conditions, changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodity and stock prices, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the realization of investment income.  Further, we invest a portion of our assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed income investments.  In addition, limited partnership investments generally present higher illiquidity than fixed income investments.  As a result of all of these factors, we may not realize an adequate return on our investments, may incur losses on sales of our investments, and may be required to write down the value of our investments.Our valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment, which is inherently uncertain.We exercise significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values, which are primarily provided by third parties, for securities in our investment portfolio, including those that are not regularly traded in active markets.  We also exercise significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary.  The valuation of residential and commercial mortgage and other asset-backed securities can be particularly sensitive to fairly small changes in collateral performance.Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these judgments, we may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other-than-temporary write downs of our investments are required.Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through our employees or vendor relationships, necessary business functions (such as Internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations.  Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities.  Likewise, 10Table of Contentswe could experience a significant failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis.  In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption.  If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions.  This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill. Loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations. We rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the United States and abroad.  These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services and human resource benefits management services.  In the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, or fails to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses.We face intense competition in our industry and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers.  Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as us are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of statutory capital and surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements.  Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets, such as Lloyd's, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable regulatory capital adequacy formula.  If we do not meet these minimum requirements, we may be restricted or prohibited from operating our business.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimate or the occurrence of an event, or if we incur significant losses related to our investment portfolio, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.While Loews has provided us with substantial amounts of capital in prior years, Loews may be restricted in its ability or may not be willing to provide additional capital support to us in the future.  If we are in need of additional capital, we may be required to secure this funding from sources other than Loews.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capital needs, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by 11Table of Contentsthe insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by jurisdiction.  The formula for the majority of domestic states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment.  Some jurisdictions, including certain domestic states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year's earned surplus.  If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash.  As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.  Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).  Ratings reflect the rating agency's opinions of an insurance company's or insurance holding company's financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.Due to the intense competitive environment in which we operate, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for us to take material unfavorable net prior year development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future.  If our property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action.  Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change in our circumstances.  We have entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if our ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds.  The ratings triggers are generally more than one level below our current ratings. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations that restrict our ability to do business and generate revenues.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision.  Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of our policyholders rather than our investors.  Each jurisdiction in which we do business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business.  In addition, the Lloyd's marketplace sets rules under which its members, including our Hardy syndicate, operate.  These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the following:•standards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements;•restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;•restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas;•the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;•the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;•potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;•licensing of insurers and agents;•approval of policy forms;•limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and12Table of Contents•limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  The jurisdictions in which we do business may also require us to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible.  Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.  Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.13Table of Contents"
18,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2012-02-21,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks.  We have described below some of the more significant risks which we face.  There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business.  Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities we issue.If we determine that our recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expense, we may need to increase our insurance reserves.We maintain insurance reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits.  Reserves represent our best estimate at a given point in time.  Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement.  Mortality is the relative incidence of death.  Morbidity is the frequency and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted.  Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on our part.  As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, we are sometimes required to add to our reserves.  This is called unfavorable net prior year development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made.  These charges can be substantial.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change.  These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in our reserves which can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity.  The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict.  Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:•the effects of worldwide economic conditions, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of certain claims, including both directors and officers (D&O) and errors and omissions (E&O) insurance claims related to corporate failures, as well as other coverages;•class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices; and•mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to welding rods, benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals, and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled.  If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  These charges could be substantial.8Table of ContentsCatastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business.  Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, and acts of terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable.  In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, and snow.The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, and the level of reinsurance and reinsurance reinstatement premiums, if any.  As in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility.  Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  As a result, losses from these types of catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to manage.As our claim experience develops on a specific catastrophe, we may be required to adjust our reserves, or take unfavorable net prior year development, to reflect our revised estimates of the total cost of claims.Our premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk.  Under our ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of our exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums.  Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in our balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves.  The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims.  As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.  Certain of our reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial condition or have been downgraded by rating agencies.  In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us.  If we are not able to collect the amounts due to us from reinsurers, our net incurred losses will be higher.We have exposures related to A&EP claims, which could result in additional losses.Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims.  Our experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.  Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP.  As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability. On August 31, 2010, we completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4 billion (Loss Portfolio Transfer).  If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, our liabilities for A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4 billion, or we determine we have exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against our earnings.  These charges could be substantial.9Table of ContentsOur key assumptions used to determine reserves and the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs for long term care products and payout annuity contracts could vary significantly from actual experience.Our reserves and the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs for long term care products and payout annuity contracts are based on certain key assumptions including: (a) morbidity; (b) mortality; (c) policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remaining in force; and (d) discount rates, which are impacted by expected investment yields.  These foregoing assumptions, while based on historical data and industry experience, and monitored consistently, are critical bases for reserve estimates.  Accordingly, if actual experience differs from these assumptions, the deferred acquisition cost asset may not be fully realized and our reserves may not be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves.  Any such adjustments to reserves would be reflected in the Statements of Operations in the period the need for such adjustment is determined.We are exposed to credit risk under deductible policies.A portion of our business is written under deductible policies.  Under these policies, we are obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant. As a result we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder.  If we are not able to collect the amounts due to us from policyholders, our incurred losses will be higher.We have incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from volatility in the capital and credit markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and currency risks, many of which are unpredictable.  Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability.  General economic conditions, changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodity and stock prices, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the realization of investment income. Further, we invest a portion of our assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than our fixed income investments.  In addition, limited partnership investments generally present higher illiquidity than fixed income investments.  As a result of all of these factors, we may not realize an adequate return on our investments, may incur losses on sales of our investments, and may be required to write down the value of our investments.Our valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment.We exercise significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values, which are primarily provided by third parties, for securities in our investment portfolio, including those that are not regularly traded in active markets.  We also exercise significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary.  Residential and commercial mortgage and other asset backed securities can be particularly sensitive to fairly small changes in collateral performance.Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of risks and the resulting judgments, we may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other-than-temporary write downs of our investments are required.We face intense competition in our industry and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services.  We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers.  Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.  The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  During periods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  As a result, our premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.10Table of ContentsWe are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as us are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.  These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of statutory capital and surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements.

If we do not meet these minimum requirements, regulators may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.  If we are required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances or if we incur significant unrealized losses related to our investment portfolio, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.While Loews has provided us with substantial amounts of capital in prior years, Loews may be restricted in its ability or may not be willing to provide additional capital support to us in the future. If we are in need of additional capital, we may be required to secure this funding from sources other than Loews.  We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capital needs, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations.  Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary state departments of insurance are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by state.  The formula for the majority of the states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment.

Additional information on catastrophe losses is included inthe MD&A under Item 7 and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.Our premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk. Under our reinsurance arrangements,another insurer assumes a specified portion of our claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchangefor a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and costof the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business andprofitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain. If we are unable to obtainsufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased riskand would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Additional information on reinsuranceis included in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in ourbalance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expensereserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, dischargeour primary liability for claims. As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to ourability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of our reinsurance carriers haveexperienced deteriorating financial condition or have been downgraded by rating agencies. Inaddition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us. If we are not able tocollect the amounts due to us from reinsurers, our incurred losses will be higher. Additionalinformation on reinsurance is included in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements includedunder Item 8.10Table of ContentsOur key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long termcare product offerings could vary significantly from actual experience.Our reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long term care product offerings are based oncertain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness,sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remainingin force, interest rates and future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs fromthese assumptions, the deferred acquisition cost asset may not be fully realized and the reservesmay not be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development.We have incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment lossesand volatility in net investment income arising from volatility in the capital and credit markets.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and currencyrisks, many of which are unpredictable. Investment returns are an important part of our overallprofitability. General economic conditions, changes in financial markets such as fluctuations ininterest rates, long term periods of low interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodityand stock prices, including the short and long-term effects of losses in relation to asset-backedsecurities, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of ourinvestments and the realization of investment income. Further, we invest a portion of our assets inequity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than ourfixed income investments. Limited partnership investments generally present greater marketvolatility, higher illiquidity, and greater risk than fixed income investments. As a result of allof these factors, we may not realize an adequate return on our investments, may incur losses onsales of our investments, and may be required to write down the value of our investments.Our valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment.We exercise significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values, primarily provided bythird parties, for securities in our investment portfolio including those that are not regularlytraded. We also exercise significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particularinvestments is temporary or other-than-temporary. Securities with exposure to residential andcommercial mortgage and other loan collateral can be particularly sensitive to fairly small changesin actual collateral performance and assumptions as to future collateral performance.Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of risks and the resulting judgments,we may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other-than-temporary write downs of ourinvestments are required. Additional information on our investment portfolio is included in theMD&A under Item 7 and Notes B, C, and D to the Consolidated Financial Statements included underItem 8.We face intense competition in our industry and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature ofthe property and casualty business.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocateresources to refine and improve our insurance products and services. We compete with a largenumber of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors andcustomers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratingsand financial strength. The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periodscharacterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwritingstandards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels ofcompetition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. Duringperiods in which price competition is high, we may lose business to competitors offeringcompetitive insurance products at lower prices. As a result, our premium levels and expense ratiocould be materially adversely impacted.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raisesufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us fromoperating our business.Insurance companies such as us are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulatorsto help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards applyspecified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our statutory capitaland surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rulesrequire companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determinedusing the risk-based capital formula. If we do not meet these minimum11Table of Contentsrequirements, state regulators may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business. If we arerequired to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates orcircumstances or if we incur significant unrealized losses related to our investment portfolio, wemay violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficientadditional capital. Examples of events leading us to record a material charge against earningsinclude impairment of our investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience.While Loews has provided us with substantial amounts of capital in prior years, Loews may berestricted in its ability or may not be willing to provide additional capital support to us in thefuture. If we are in need of additional capital, we may be required to secure this funding fromsources other than Loews. We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capitalon favorable terms or at all.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capitalneeds, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from oursubsidiaries in order to meet our obligations. Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that donot require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries domiciliary state departments ofinsurance are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by state. Theformula for the majority of the states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus orthe prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelvemonths prior to the date of payment. Some states, however, have an additional stipulation thatdividends cannot exceed the prior years earned surplus. If we are restricted, by regulatory ruleor otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, we may not be able to fund ourworking capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, we wouldneed to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available atall.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to writeinsurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies,namely, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Standard &Poors (S&P). Ratings reflect the rating agencys opinions of an insurance companys or insuranceholding companys financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic positionand ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.Due to the intense competitive environment in which we operate, the uncertainty in determiningreserves and the potential for us to take material unfavorable development in the future, andpossible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agenciesmay take action to lower our ratings in the future. If our property and casualty insurancefinancial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels, our business and results ofoperations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on our business isdependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the ratingaction. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtaina material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell amaterial volume of our insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization ofcertain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a lowering of the corporate debt ratings of Loews by certain ofthe rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change inour circumstances. We have entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurancecontracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if ourratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers aregenerally more than one level below our current ratings. Additional information on our ratings andratings triggers is included in the MD&A under Item 7.We are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations that restrict ourability to do business and generate revenues.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervisionthroughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests ofour policyholders rather than12Table of Contentsour investors. Each state in which we do business has established supervisory agencies thatregulate the manner in which we do business. Their regulations relate to, among other things, thefollowing: standards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements;  restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;  restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance orunprofitable market areas;  the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;  the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;  potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired,insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;  licensing of insurers and agents;  approval of policy forms;  limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and  limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not beexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The states in which we do business also requireus to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible. Each statedictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntaryrisks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of ourrespective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.13Table of Contents"
11,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2010-02-23,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which weface. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currentlyperceive to be significant that may also impact our business. Each of the risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings. Youshould carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and anysubsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in anysecurities we issue.We have incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment lossesand volatility in net investment income arising from the severe disruption in the capital andcredit markets.Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability. General economicconditions, changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates, long term periodsof low interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodity and stock prices, including theshort and long-term effects of losses in relation to asset-backed securities, and many otherfactors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the realization ofinvestment income. Further, we invest a portion of our assets in equity securities and limitedpartnerships which are subject to greater volatility than our fixed income investments. Limitedpartnership investments generally present greater volatility, higher illiquidity, and greater riskthan fixed income investments. As a result of all of these factors, we may not realize an adequatereturn on our investments, may incur losses on sales of our investments, and may be required towrite down the value of our investments. Therefore, our results of operations, equity, businessand insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.Our underwriting results may continue to suffer as a result of the unfavorable global economicconditions.Overall global economic conditions may continue to be recessionary and highly unfavorable.Although many lines of our business have both direct and indirect exposure to these economicconditions, the exposure is especially high for the lines of business that provide management andprofessional liability insurance, as well as surety bonds, to businesses engaged in real estate,financial services and professional services. As a result, we have experienced and may continue toexperience unanticipated underwriting losses with respect to these lines of business.Additionally, global recessionary conditions have led to decreased insured exposures causing us toexperience declines in premium volume. Consequently, our results of operations, equity, businessand insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be adversely impacted.Our valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and currencyrisks, many of which are unpredictable. We exercise significant judgment in analyzing these risksand in validating fair values provided by third parties for securities in our investment portfoliothat are not regularly traded. We also exercise significant judgment in determining whether theimpairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary. Securities withexposure to residential and commercial mortgage and other loan collateral can be particularlysensitive to fairly small changes in actual collateral performance and assumptions as to futurecollateral performance.During 2008, we incurred significant unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. During 2009,financial markets were volatile and we experienced improvement in our unrealized position. Inaddition, during 2009 and 2008 we recorded significant other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI)losses primarily in the corporate and other taxable bonds, asset-backed securities andnon-redeemable preferred equity securities sectors.Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of risks and the resulting judgments,we may incur further unrealized losses and conclude that further other-than-temporary write downsof our investments are required. As a result, our results of operations, equity, business andinsurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted. Additionalinformation on our investment portfolio is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Notes B, C, and Dto the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.8Table of ContentsWe are unable to predict the impact on us of governmental efforts and policy changes taken andproposed to be taken in response to the unfavorable economic conditions.The federal government has implemented various measures, including the establishment of theTroubled Assets Relief Program pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, in aneffort to deal with the ongoing economic conditions. In addition, there are numerous proposals forfurther legislative and regulatory actions at both the federal and state levels, particularly withrespect to the financial services industry. Since these new laws and regulations, or other policychanges, could involve critical matters affecting our operations, they may have an impact on ourbusiness and our overall financial condition. Due to this significant uncertainty, we are unableto determine whether our actions in response to these governmental efforts will be effective or topredict with any certainty the overall impact these governmental efforts will have on us. As aresult, our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratingscould be materially adversely impacted.We are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations that restrict ourability to do business and generate revenues.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervisionthroughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests ofour policyholders rather than our investors. Each state in which we do business has establishedsupervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business. Their regulations relateto, among other things, the following: standards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements;  restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;  restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance orunprofitable market areas;  the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;  the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;  potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired,insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;  licensing of insurers and agents;  approval of policy forms;  limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and  limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not beexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The states in which we do business also requireus to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible. Each statedictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntaryrisks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of ourrespective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.Any of these regulations could materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity,business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raisesufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us fromoperating our business.Insurance companies such as us are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulatorsto help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards applyspecified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our statutory capitaland surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rulesrequire companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determinedusing the risk-based capital formula. If we do not meet these minimum requirements, stateregulators may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business. If we are required to record amaterial charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances or if we9Table of Contentsincur significant unrealized losses related to our investment portfolio, we may violate theseminimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital.Examples of events leading us to record a material charge against earnings include impairment ofour investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience.Loews has provided us with substantial amounts of capital in prior years. Loews may be restrictedin its ability or willingness to provide additional capital support to us. As a result, if we arein need of additional capital, we may be required to secure this funding from sources other thanLoews. We may be limited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable termsor at all.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to writeinsurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies,namely, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Standard &Poors. Ratings reflect the rating agencys opinions of an insurance companys or insuranceholding companys financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic positionand ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.Due to the intense competitive environment in which we operate, the disruption in the capital andcredit markets, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for us to take materialunfavorable development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria appliedby the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future. Ifour property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels,our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of theimpact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, whichrating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgradeswould be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurancebrokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets, andthe required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a lowering of the debt ratings of Loews by certain of the ratingagencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change in ourcircumstances. We have entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurancecontracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if ourratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers aregenerally more than one level below our current ratings. Additional information on our ratings andratings triggers is included in the MD&A under Item 7.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capitalneeds, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from oursubsidiaries in order to meet our obligations. Ordinary dividend payments, or dividends that donot require prior approval by the subsidiaries domiciliary state departments of insurance aregenerally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by state. The formula for themajority of the states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior yearstatutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior tothe date of payment. Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannotexceed the prior years earned surplus. If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise,from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capitalneeds and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, we would need to look toother sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.If we determine that our recorded loss reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimateunpaid liability for claims, we may need to increase our loss reserves.We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claimadjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reservesrepresent our best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exactcalculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing avariety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about futureevents, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of10Table of Contentsclaims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation,claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changesin the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured eventand the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not preciselyquantifiable and require significant judgment on our part. As trends in underlying claims develop,particularly in so-called long tail or long duration coverages, we are sometimes required to addto our reserves. This is called unfavorable net prior year development and results in a charge toour earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate ismade. These charges can be substantial. Additional information on our reserves is included in theMD&A under Item 7 and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues thatarise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change.These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by eitherextending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size ofclaims, resulting in further increases in our reserves which can have a material adverse effect onour results of operations and equity. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim andcoverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of emerging or potential claim andcoverage issues include: increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from various medicalproducts including pharmaceuticals;  the effects of recessionary economic conditions and financial reporting scandals, whichhave resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims, due to corporate failures;these claims include both directors and officers (D&O) and errors and omissions (E&O)insurance claims;  class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices;  construction defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional insuredendorsements on policies;  clergy abuse claims, including passage of legislation to reopen or extend various statutesof limitations; and  mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to welding rods, benzene, lead,noise induced hearing loss and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making theassumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in aregular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. Inaddition, we periodically undergo state regulatory financial examinations, including review andanalysis of our reserves. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the requiredincrease in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings for the period in whichreserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial and couldmaterially adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financialstrength and debt ratings.Loss reserves for asbestos and environmental pollution are especially difficult to estimate and mayresult in more frequent and larger additions to these reserves.Our experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to asbestos andenvironmental pollution (which we refer to as A&E) claim and claim adjustment expenses are subjectto uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimatecost of both reported and unreported claims are subject to a higher degree of variability due to anumber of additional factors including, among others, the following: coverage issues including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whetherpolicy limits apply;  inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories;  continuing aggressive tactics of plaintiffs lawyers;  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;11Table of Contents changes in the frequency of asbestos and environmental pollution claims;  changes in the severity of claims including bodily injury claims for malignancies arisingout of exposure to asbestos;  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on anyumbrella or excess policies we have issued;  our ability to recover reinsurance for these claims; and  changes in the legal and legislative environment in which we operate.As a result of this higher degree of variability, we have necessarily supplemented traditionalactuarial methods and techniques with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many ofwhich involve significant judgment on our part. Consequently, we may periodically need to recordchanges in our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future in these areas in amountsthat could materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurerfinancial strength and debt ratings. Additional information on A&E claims is included in the MD&Aunder Item 7 and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.               Asbestos claims. The estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularlydifficult in light of the factors noted above. In addition, our ability to estimate the ultimatecost of asbestos claims is further complicated by the following: inconsistency of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court decisions;  interpretation of specific policy provisions;  allocation of liability among insurers and insureds;  missing policies and proof of coverage;  the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties;  novel theories asserted by policyholders and their legal counsel;  the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants;  uncertainties in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds may betargeted in the future;  volatility in frequency of claims and severity of settlement demands;  increases in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can beprecluded from making claims;  the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to aggregate limits;  the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation, as well as theresulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims;  medical inflation trends;  the mix of asbestos-related diseases presented; and  the ability to recover reinsurance.In addition, a number of our insureds have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subjectto aggregate limits on coverage. If these insureds are successful in this regard, our potentialliability for their claims would be unlimited. Some of these insureds contend that their asbestosclaims fall within the so-called non-products liability coverage within their policies, ratherthan the products liability coverage, and that this non-products liability coverage is notsubject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the extent to which these claims willsucceed and, as a result, the ultimate size of these claims.               Environmental pollution claims. The estimation of reserves for environmentalpollution claims is complicated by liability and coverage issues arising from these claims. We andothers in the insurance industry12Table of Contentsare disputing coverage for many such claims. In addition to the coverage issues noted in theasbestos claims section above, key coverage issues in environmental pollution claims include thefollowing: whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and accordingly whether wewould be liable for these costs);  the trigger of coverage and the allocation of liability among triggered policies;  the applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions;  the potential for joint and several liability; and  the definition of an occurrence.To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding to theuncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.Further, the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability andinsurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensivelitigation. In many cases, courts have expanded the scope of coverage and liability for cleanupcosts beyond the original intent of our insurance policies. Additionally, the standards forcleanup in environmental pollution matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject tocleanup under applicable laws is unknown, and the impact of various proposals to reform existingstatutes and regulations is difficult to predict.We may suffer losses from non-routine litigation and arbitration matters which may exceed thereserves we have established.We face substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims and A&Ematters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered by reserves that we haveestablished. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify and may seek recovery of verylarge or indeterminate amounts that include punitive or treble damages. Accordingly, unfavorableresults in these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations,equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings.Additional information on litigation is included in Notes F and G to the Consolidated FinancialStatements included under Item 8.Catastrophe losses are unpredictable.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business. Various events can cause catastrophelosses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, severe winter weather, andfires, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-termnatural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developingdue to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked torising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, landand air temperatures, sea levels, rain, and snow. The extent of our losses from catastrophes is afunction of both the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas and the severityof the events themselves. In addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can takea long time for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined. As our claim experience developson a particular catastrophe, we may be required to adjust our reserves, or take unfavorabledevelopment, to reflect our revised estimates of the total cost of claims. We believe we couldincur significant catastrophe losses in the future. Therefore, our results of operations, equity,business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.Additional information on catastrophe losses is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note F to theConsolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.Our key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long termcare product offerings could vary significantly from actual experience.Our reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long term care product offerings are based oncertain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness,sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remainingin force, interest rates and future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs fromthese assumptions, the deferred acquisition asset may not be fully realized and the reserves maynot be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves, or take unfavorable13Table of Contentsdevelopment. Therefore, our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strengthand debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.We are unable to predict the impact on us of federal health care reform legislation.The federal government may be implementing landmark health care reform legislation that couldinvolve critical matters affecting our operations, particularly our workers compensation and longterm care products. Until the legislation is enacted, we are unable to predict with any certaintythe overall impact it will have on us. As a result, our results of operations, equity, businessand insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.We continue to face exposure to losses arising from terrorist acts, despite the passage of theTerrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 extended, until December 31, 2014,the program established within the U.S. Department of Treasury by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Actof 2002. This program requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage and the federal government toshare in insured losses arising from acts of terrorism. Given the unpredictability of the nature,targets, severity and frequency of potential terrorist acts, this program does not provide completeprotection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism. Further, the laws of certain statesrestrict our ability to mitigate this residual exposure. For example, some states mandate propertyinsurance coverage of damage from fire following a loss, thereby prohibiting us from excludingterrorism exposure. In addition, some states generally prohibit us from excluding terrorismexposure from our primary workers compensation policies. Consequently, there is substantialuncertainty as to our ability to contain our terrorism exposure effectively since we continue toissue forms of coverage, in particular, workers compensation, that are exposed to risk of lossfrom a terrorism act. As a result, our results of operations, equity, business and insurerfinancial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted by terrorist act losses.Our premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk. Under our reinsurance arrangements,another insurer assumes a specified portion of our claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchangefor a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and costof the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business andprofitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain. If we are unable to obtainsufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased riskand would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Therefore, our financial results ofoperations could be materially adversely impacted. Additional information on reinsurance isincluded in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in ourbalance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expensereserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, dischargeour primary liability for claims. As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to ourability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of our reinsurance carriers haveexperienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies. Acontinuation or worsening of the current unfavorable global economic conditions could similarlyimpact all of our reinsurers. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe aredue to us. If we are not able to collect the amounts due to us from reinsurers, our claimsexpenses will be higher which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity,business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings. Additional information on reinsurance isincluded in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We face intense competition in our industry and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature ofthe property and casualty business.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocateresources to refine and improve our insurance products and services. We compete with a largenumber of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors andcustomers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratingsand financial strength. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive insuranceproducts at lower prices. The property and casualty market is cyclical and has14Table of Contentsexperienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictiveunderwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lowerlevels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. Asa result, our premium levels, expense ratio, results of operations, equity, business and insurerfinancial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.We are dependent on a small number of key executives and other key personnel to operate ourbusiness successfully.Our success substantially depends upon our ability to attract and retain high quality keyexecutives and other employees. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualifiedexecutives in the business lines in which we compete. We rely substantially upon the services ofour executive officers to implement our business strategy. The loss of the services of any membersof our management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impedethe implementation of our business strategies.

3,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2009-02-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which weface. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currentlyperceive to be significant that may also impact our business. Each of the risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations, financial condition or equity. You should carefully consider andevaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file withthe Securities and Exchange Commission or make available to the public before investing in anysecurities we issue.We may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility innet investment income arising from the severe disruption in the capital and credit markets.We maintain a large portfolio of fixed income and equity securities, including large amounts ofcorporate and government issued debt securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs),asset-backed and other structured securities, equity and equity-based securities and investments inlimited partnerships which pursue a variety of long and short investment strategies across a broadarray of asset classes. Our investment portfolio supports our obligation to pay future insuranceclaims and provides investment returns which are an important part of our overall profitability.For more than a year, capital and credit markets have experienced severe levels of volatility,illiquidity, uncertainty and overall disruption. Despite government intervention, marketconditions have led to the merger or failure of a number of prominent financial institutions andgovernment sponsored entities, sharply increased unemployment and reduced economic activity. Inaddition, significant declines in the value of assets and securities that began with theresidential sub-prime mortgage crisis have spread to nearly all classes of investments, includingmost of those held in our investment portfolio. As a result, during 2008 we incurred significantrealized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio and experienced substantial declines inour net investment income which have materially adversely impacted our results of operations andequity.In addition, certain categories of our investments are particularly subject to significantexposures in the current market environment. Although we normally expect limited partnershipinvestments to provide higher returns over time, since 2008, they have presented greater risk,greater volatility and higher illiquidity than our fixed income investments. Commercialmortgage-backed securities (CMBS) also present greater risks due to the credit deterioration in thecommercial real estate market. Notably, even senior tranches of CMBS have experienced significantprice erosion due to market concerns involving the valuation and credit performance of commercialreal estate. If these economic and market conditions persist, we may continue to experiencereduced investment income and to incur substantial additional realized and unrealized losses on ourinvestments. As a result, our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financialstrength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted. Additional information on ourinvestment portfolio is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note B to the Consolidated FinancialStatements included under Item 8.We may continue to incur underwriting losses as a result of the global economic crisis.Overall global economic conditions may continue to be recessionary and highly unfavorable.Although many lines of our business have both direct and indirect exposure to this economic crisis,the exposure is especially high for the lines of business that provide management and professionalliability insurance, as well as surety bonds, to businesses engaged in real estate, financialservices and professional services. As a result, we have experienced and may continue to experienceunanticipated underwriting losses with respect to these lines of business. Additionally, we couldexperience declines in our premium volume and related insurance losses. Consequently, our resultsof operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be adverselyimpacted.Our valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment.Our investment portfolio is exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and creditrisks, many of which are unpredictable. We exercise significant judgment in analyzing these risksand in validating fair values provided by third parties for securities in our investment portfoliothat are not regularly traded. We also exercise significant judgment in determining whether theimpairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary. Securities withexposure to sub-prime residential mortgage collateral or Alternative A (Alt-A) collateral areparticularly sensitive to fairly small changes in actual collateral performance and assumptions asto future collateral performance.9 During 2008, we incurred significant unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. In addition,we recorded significant other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses primarily in the corporateand other taxable bonds, asset-backed bonds and non-redeemable preferred equity securities sectors.Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, we may incur furtherunrealized losses and conclude that further other-than-temporary write downs of our investments arerequired. As a result, our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strengthand debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted. Additional information on our investmentportfolio is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statementsincluded under Item 8.We are unable to predict the impact on us of governmental efforts taken and proposed to be taken inresponse to the economic and credit crisis.The Federal government has implemented various measures, including the establishment of theTroubled Assets Relief Program pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, in aneffort to deal with the ongoing economic and credit crisis. In addition, there are numerousproposals for further legislative and regulatory actions at both the Federal and state levels,particularly with respect to the financial services industry. Since these new laws and regulationscould involve critical matters affecting our operations, they may have an impact on our businessand our overall financial condition. Due to this significant uncertainty, we are unable todetermine whether our actions in response to these governmental efforts will be effective or topredict with any certainty the overall impact these governmental efforts will have on us. As aresult, our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratingscould be materially adversely impacted.We may continue to incur significant losses from our investments in financial institutions.Our investment portfolio includes preferred stock and hybrid debt securities issued by banks andother financial institutions. To date, government sponsored efforts to recapitalize the financialsystem both in the United States, as well as overseas, have been inconsistent and unpredictable.The uncertainty surrounding these efforts and their potential impact on existing financialinstitution securities has caused these securities to experience adverse price movement and ratingagency downgrades. If this uncertainty continues or if regulatory decisions negatively affect ourinvestments in financial institutions, we may continue to incur significant losses in ourinvestment portfolio. As a result, our results of operations, equity, business and insurerfinancial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted. Additional informationon our investment portfolio is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note B to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements included under Item 8.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to writeinsurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies,namely, A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Standard &Poors. Ratings reflect the rating agencys opinions of an insurance companys financial strength,capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations topolicyholders and debtholders.Due to the intense competitive environment in which we operate, the severe disruption in thecapital and credit markets, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for us totake material unfavorable development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology orcriteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to lower our ratingsin the future. If our property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings are downgradedbelow current levels, our business and results of operations could be materially adverselyaffected. The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and,for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects inthe event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business fromcertain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance productsto certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations orreserves. Recently, Moodys and A.M. Best have revised their outlook on us from stable tonegative.In addition, it is possible that a lowering of the debt ratings of Loews by certain of the ratingagencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change in ourcircumstances. We have entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurancecontracts that require collateralization of future10 payment obligations and assumed reserves if our ratings or other specific criteria fall belowcertain thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more than one level below our currentratings. Additional information on our ratings and ratings triggers is included in the MD&A underItem 7.We are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations that restrict ourability to do business and generate revenues.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervisionthroughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests ofour policyholders rather than our investors. Each state in which we do business has establishedsupervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business. Their regulations relateto, among other things, the following: standards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements;  restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;  restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance orunprofitable market areas;  the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;  the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;  potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired,insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;  licensing of insurers and agents;  approval of policy forms;  limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and  limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not beexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The states in which we do business also requireus to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible. Each statedictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntaryrisks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of ourrespective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.Any of these regulations could materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity,business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we are unable to maintain or raisesufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us fromoperating our business.Insurance companies such as us are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulatorsto help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards applyspecified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our statutory capitaland surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rulesrequire companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determinedusing the risk-based capital formula. If we do not meet these minimum requirements, stateregulators may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business. If we are required to record amaterial charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances, we mayviolate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficientadditional capital. Examples of events leading us to record a material charge against earningsinclude impairment of our investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience.During the fourth quarter of 2008, we took several actions to replenish our capital position andbolster the statutory surplus of our operating insurance subsidiaries. One of these actions wasthe November 7, 2008 purchase by Loews of 12,500 shares of our non-voting cumulative preferredstock (2008 Senior Preferred) for $1.25 billion. Loews, which owned approximately 90% of ouroutstanding common stock as of December 31, 2008, has also provided us with substantial amounts ofcapital in prior years. Given the ongoing turmoil in the capital and credit markets, we may belimited in our ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all. Inaddition, Loews may be restricted in its ability or willingness to provide additional capitalsupport to us. As a result, if we are in need of additional capital, we may be required toattempt to secure this funding from sources other than Loews on terms that are not favorable.11 Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capitalneeds, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from oursubsidiaries in order to meet our obligations. Dividend payments, however, must be approved by thesubsidiaries domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amountsdetermined by formula which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states is thegreater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less theaggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment. Somestates, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior yearsearned surplus. If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receivinginter-company dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt servicerequirements from available cash. As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capitalwhich may be more expensive or may not be available at all.If we determine that loss reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaidliability for claims, we may need to increase our loss reserves.We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claimadjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reservesrepresent our best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exactcalculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing avariety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about futureevents, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency ofclaims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling, case reservingpolicies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatoryenvironment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of itsultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and requiresignificant judgment on our part. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly inso-called long tail or long duration coverages, we are sometimes required to add to our reserves.This is called unfavorable development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount ofthe added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can besubstantial and can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity.Additional information on our reserves is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note F to theConsolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues thatarise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change.These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by eitherextending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size ofclaims, resulting in further increases in our reserves which can have a material adverse effect onour results of operations and equity. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim andcoverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of emerging or potential claims andcoverage issues include: increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical products;  the effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other major corporategovernance failures, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims,including director and officer and errors and omissions insurance claims;  class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices;  construction defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional insuredendorsements on policies;  clergy abuse claims, including passage of legislation to reopen or extend various statutesof limitations; and  mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to silica, welding rods, benzene,lead and various other chemical exposure claims.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making theassumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in aregular and ongoing12 process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. In addition, weperiodically undergo state regulatory financial examinations, including review and analysis of ourreserves. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserveswould be recorded as a charge against our earnings for the period in which reserves are determinedto be insufficient. These charges could be substantial and could materially adversely affect ourresults of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings.Loss reserves for asbestos and environmental pollution are especially difficult to estimate and mayresult in more frequent and larger additions to these reserves.Our experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to asbestos andenvironmental pollution (which we refer to as A&E) claim and claim adjustment expenses are subjectto uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimatecost of both reported and unreported claims are subject to a higher degree of variability due to anumber of additional factors including, among others, the following: coverage issues including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whetherpolicy limits apply;  inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories;  continuing aggressive tactics of plaintiffs lawyers;  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;  changes in the volume of asbestos and environmental pollution claims;  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on anyumbrella or excess policies we have issued;  the number and outcome of direct actions against us;  our ability to recover reinsurance for these claims; and  changes in the legal and legislative environment in which we operate.As a result of this higher degree of variability, we have necessarily supplemented traditionalactuarial methods and techniques with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many ofwhich involve significant judgment on our part. Consequently, we may periodically need to recordchanges in our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future in these areas in amountsthat could materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurerfinancial strength and debt ratings. Additional information on A&E claims is included in the MD&Aunder Item 7 and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.     Asbestos claims. The estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult inlight of the factors noted above. In addition, our ability to estimate the ultimate cost ofasbestos claims is further complicated by the following: inconsistency of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court decisions;  interpretation of specific policy provisions;  allocation of liability among insurers and insureds;  missing policies and proof of coverage;  the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties;  novel theories asserted by policyholders and their legal counsel;  the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants;  uncertainties in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds may betargeted in the future;  volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands;13  increases in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can beprecluded from making claims;  the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to aggregate limits;  the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation, as well as theresulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims;  medical inflation trends;  the mix of asbestos-related diseases presented; and  the ability to recover reinsurance.In addition, a number of our insureds have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subjectto aggregate limits on coverage. If these insureds are successful in this regard, our potentialliability for their claims would be unlimited. Some of these insureds contend that their asbestosclaims fall within the so-called non-products liability coverage within their policies, ratherthan the products liability coverage, and that this non-products liability coverage is notsubject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the extent to which these claims willsucceed and, as a result, the ultimate size of these claims.     Environmental pollution claims. The estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claims iscomplicated by liability and coverage issues arising from these claims. We and others in theinsurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims. In addition to the coverage issuesnoted in the asbestos claims section above, key coverage issues in environmental pollution claimsinclude the following: whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and accordingly whether wewould be liable for these costs);  the trigger of coverage and the allocation of liability among triggered policies;  the applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions;  the potential for joint and several liability; and  the definition of an occurrence.To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding to theuncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.Further, the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability andinsurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensivelitigation. In many cases, courts have expanded the scope of coverage and liability for cleanupcosts beyond the original intent of our insurance policies. Additionally, the standards forcleanup in environmental pollution matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject tocleanup under applicable laws is unknown, and the impact of various proposals to reform existingstatutes and regulations is difficult to predict.We may suffer losses from non-routine litigation and arbitration matters which may exceed thereserves we have established.We face substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims and A&Ematters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered by reserves that we haveestablished. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify and may seek recovery of verylarge or indeterminate amounts that include punitive or treble damages. Accordingly, unfavorableresults in these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations,equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings.Additional information on litigation is included in Notes F and G to the Consolidated FinancialStatements included under Item 8.Catastrophe losses are unpredictable.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business. Various events can cause catastrophelosses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, severe winter weather, andfires, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-termnatural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developingdue to climate change, a phenomenon that has been14 associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects onglobal weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, andsnow. The extent of our losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of ourinsured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves. In addition, asin the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to us tobe finally determined. As our claim experience develops on a particular catastrophe, we may berequired to adjust our reserves, or take unfavorable development, to reflect our revised estimatesof the total cost of claims. We believe we could incur significant catastrophe losses in thefuture. Therefore, our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength anddebt ratings could be materially adversely impacted. Additional information on catastrophe lossesis included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements includedunder Item 8.Our key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long termcare product offerings could vary significantly from actual experience.Our reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long term care product offerings are based oncertain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness,sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remainingin force, interest rates and future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs fromthese assumptions, the deferred acquisition asset may not be fully realized and the reserves maynot be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development. Therefore, ourresults of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings could bematerially adversely impacted.We continue to face exposure to losses arising from terrorist acts, despite the passage of theTerrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 extended, until December 31, 2014,the program established within the U.S. Department of Treasury by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Actof 2002. This program requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage and the federal government toshare in insured losses arising from acts of terrorism. Given the unpredictability of the nature,targets, severity and frequency of potential terrorist acts, this program does not provide completeprotection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism. Further, the laws of certain statesrestrict our ability to mitigate this residual exposure. For example, some states mandate propertyinsurance coverage of damage from fire following a loss, thereby prohibiting us from excludingterrorism exposure. In addition, some states generally prohibit us from excluding terrorismexposure from our primary workers compensation policies. Consequently, there is substantialuncertainty as to our ability to contain our terrorism exposure effectively since we continue toissue forms of coverage, in particular, workers compensation, that are exposed to risk of lossfrom a terrorism act. As a result, our results of operations, equity, business and insurerfinancial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted by terrorist act losses.Our premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk. Under our reinsurance arrangements,another insurer assumes a specified portion of our claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchangefor a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and costof the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business andprofitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain. If we are unable to obtainsufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased riskand would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Therefore, our financial results ofoperations could be materially adversely impacted. Additional information on reinsurance isincluded in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in ourbalance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expensereserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, dischargeour primary liability for claims. As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to ourability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of our reinsurance carriers haveexperienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies. Acontinuation or worsening of the current highly unfavorable global economic conditions, along withthe severe disruptions in the capital and credit markets, could similarly impact all of ourreinsurers. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us. If weare not able to collect the amounts due to us from reinsurers, our claims expenses will be higherwhich could materially adversely affect15 our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings.Additional information on reinsurance is included in Note H to the Consolidated FinancialStatements included under Item 8.We face intense competition in our industry and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature ofthe property and casualty business.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocateresources to refine and improve our insurance products and services. We compete with a largenumber of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors andcustomers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratingsand financial strength. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive insuranceproducts at lower prices. The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periodscharacterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwritingstandards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels ofcompetition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. As a result,our premium levels, expense ratio, results of operations, equity, business and insurer financialstrength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.We are dependent on a small number of key executives and other key personnel to operate ourbusiness successfully.Our success substantially depends upon our ability to attract and retain high quality keyexecutives and other employees. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualifiedexecutives in the business lines in which we compete. We rely substantially upon the services ofour executive officers to implement our business strategy. The loss of the services of any membersof our management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impedethe implementation of our business strategies. We do not maintain key man life insurance policieswith respect to any of our employees.16 "

Additional information on A&E claims is included in MD&Aunder Item 7 and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.     Environmental pollution claims. The estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claimsis complicated by the assertion by many policyholders of claims for defense costs andindemnification. We and others in the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many suchclaims. Key coverage issues in these claims include the following: whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and accordingly whether wewould be liable for these costs); the trigger of coverage and the allocation of liability among triggered policies; the applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions; the potential for joint and several liability; and the definition of an occurrence.To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding to theuncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.Further, the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability andinsurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensivelitigation. In many cases, courts have expanded the scope of coverage and liability for cleanupcosts beyond the original intent of our insurance policies. Additionally, the standards for cleanupin environmental pollution matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject to cleanupunder applicable laws is unknown, and the impact of various proposals to reform existing statutesand regulations is difficult to predict.10Table of Contents     Asbestos claims. The estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult formany of the same reasons discussed above for environmental pollution claims, as well as thefollowing: inconsistency of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court decisions; specific policy provisions; allocation of liability among insurers and insureds; missing policies and proof of coverage; the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties; novel theories asserted by policyholders and their legal counsel; the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants; uncertainties in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds may betargeted in the future; volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands; increases in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can beprecluded from making claims; the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to aggregate limits; the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation, as well as theresulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims; medical inflation trends; the mix of asbestos-related diseases presented; and the ability to recover reinsurance.In addition, a number of our insureds have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subjectto aggregate limits on coverage. If these insureds are successful in this regard, our potentialliability for their claims would be unlimited. Some of these insureds contend that their asbestosclaims fall within the so-called non-products liability coverage within their policies, ratherthan the products liability coverage, and that this non-products liability coverage is notsubject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the extent to which these claims willsucceed and, as a result, the ultimate size of these claims.Catastrophe losses are unpredictable.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business. Various events can cause catastrophelosses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, severe winter weather, andfires, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-termnatural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developingdue to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked torising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, landand air temperatures, sea levels, rain, and snow. For example, in 2005, we experienced substantiallosses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. The extent of our losses from catastrophes is afunction of both the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas and the severityof the events themselves. In addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can takea long time for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined. As our claim experience developson a particular catastrophe, we may be required to adjust our reserves, or take unfavorabledevelopment, to reflect our revised estimates of the total cost of claims. We believe we couldincur significant catastrophe losses in the future. Therefore, our results of operations, equity,business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.Additional information on catastrophe losses is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note F to theConsolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.11Table of ContentsOur key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long termcare product offerings could vary significantly from actual experience.Our reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long term care product offerings are based oncertain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness,sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remainingin force, interest rates and future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs fromthese assumptions, the deferred acquisition asset may not be fully realized and the reserves maynot be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development. Therefore, ourresults of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings could bematerially adversely impacted.We continue to face exposure to losses arising from terrorist acts, despite the passage of theTerrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 extended, until December 31, 2014,the program established within the U.S. Department of Treasury by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Actof 2002. This program requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage and the federal government toshare in insured losses arising from acts of terrorism. Given the unpredictability of the nature,targets, severity and frequency of potential terrorist acts, this program does not provide completeprotection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism. Further, the laws of certain statesrestrict our ability to mitigate this residual exposure. For example, some states mandate propertyinsurance coverage of damage from fire following a loss, thereby prohibiting us from excludingterrorism exposure. In addition, some states generally prohibit us from excluding terrorismexposure from our primary workers compensation policies. Consequently, there is substantialuncertainty as to our ability to contain our terrorism exposure effectively since we continue toissue forms of coverage, in particular, workers compensation, that are exposed to risk of lossfrom a terrorism act. As a result, our results of operations, equity, business and insurerfinancial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.High levels of retained overhead expenses associated with business lines in run-off negativelyimpact our operating results.During the past several years, we ceased offering certain insurance products relating principallyto our life, group and reinsurance segments. Many of these business lines were sold, others havebeen placed in run-off and, as a result, revenue has decreased. Our results of operations havebeen materially adversely affected by the high levels of retained overhead expenses associated withthese run-off operations, and will continue to be so affected if we are not successful ineliminating or reducing these costs.Our premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk. Under our reinsurance arrangements,another insurer assumes a specified portion of our claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchangefor a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and costof the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business andprofitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain. If we are unable to obtainsufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased riskand would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Therefore, our financial results ofoperations could be materially adversely impacted. Additional information on reinsurance isincluded in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in ourbalance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expensereserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, dischargeour primary liability for claims. As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to ourability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of our reinsurance carriers haveexperienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies. Inaddition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us. If we are not able tocollect the amounts due to us from reinsurers, our claims expenses will be higher which couldmaterially adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financialstrength and debt ratings. Additional information on reinsurance is included in Note H to theConsolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.12Table of ContentsRating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to writeinsurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by rating agencies,namely, A.M. Best Company, Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. Ratingsreflect the rating agencys opinions of an insurance companys financial strength, capitaladequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations topolicyholders and debtholders.Due to the intense competitive environment in which we operate, the uncertainty in determiningreserves and the potential for us to take material unfavorable development in the future, andpossible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agenciesmay take action to lower our ratings in the future. If our property and casualty insurancefinancial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels, our business and results ofoperations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on our business isdependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the ratingaction. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtaina material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell amaterial volume of our insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization ofcertain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, it is possible that a lowering of the debt ratings of Loews Corporation by certain ofthe rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change inour circumstances. We have entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurancecontracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if ourratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers aregenerally more than one level below our current ratings. Additional information on our ratings isincluded in the MD&A under Item 7.We are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations that restrict ourability to do business and generate revenues.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervisionthroughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests ofour policyholders rather than our investors. Each state in which we do business has establishedsupervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business. Their regulations relateto, among other things, the following: standards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements; restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments; restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance orunprofitable market areas; the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting; the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired,insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers; licensing of insurers and agents; approval of policy forms; limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not beexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The states in which we do business also requireus to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible. Each statedictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntaryrisks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of ourrespective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.13Table of ContentsWe are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we do not meet these requirements,regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as us are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulatorsto help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards applyspecified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our statutory capitaland surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rulesrequire companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determinedusing the risk-based capital formula. If we do not meet these minimum requirements, stateregulators may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business. If we are required to record amaterial charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances, we mayviolate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficientadditional capital. Examples of events leading us to record a material charge against earningsinclude impairment of our investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capitalneeds, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from oursubsidiaries in order to meet our obligations. Dividend payments, however, must be approved by thesubsidiaries domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amountsdetermined by formula which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states is thegreater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less theaggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment. Somestates, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior yearsearned surplus. If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receivinginter-company dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt servicerequirements from available cash. As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capitalwhich may be more expensive or may not be available at all.We received subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to insurance brokers and agents,contingent commissions and bidding practices, and certain finite-risk insurance products.Along with other companies in the industry, we received subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiriesfrom and have produced documents and/or provided information to: (i) California, Connecticut,Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulatorsconcerning investigations into practices including contingent compensation arrangements, fictitiousquotes, and tying arrangements; (ii) the SEC, the New York State Attorney General, the UnitedStates Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the Connecticut Attorney General, theConnecticut Department of Insurance, the Delaware Department of Insurance, the Georgia Office ofInsurance and Safety Fire Commissioner and the California Department of Insurance concerningreinsurance products and finite insurance products purchased and sold by us; (iii) theMassachusetts Attorney General and the Connecticut Attorney General concerning investigations intoanti-competitive practices; and (iv) the New York State Attorney General concerning declinations ofattorney malpractice insurance.The SEC and representatives of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of NewYork conducted interviews with several of our current and former executives relating to therestatement of our financial results for 2004, including our relationship with and accounting fortransactions with an affiliate that were the basis for the restatement. We have also provided theSEC with information relating to our restatement in 2006 of prior period results. It is possiblethat our analyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance contracts or discontinuedoperations could be questioned or disputed by regulatory authorities.Our investment portfolio, which is a key component of our overall profitability, may suffer reducedreturns or losses, in the event of changing interest rates or adverse credit conditions in thecapital markets.Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability. General economicconditions, changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates, long term periodsof low interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodity and stock prices, including theshort and long-term effects of losses produced or threatened in relation to sub-prime residentialmortgage-backed securities, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect thereturns and the overall value of our investments and the realization of14Table of Contentsinvestment income. In addition, any defaults in the payments due to us for our investments,especially with respect to fixed maturity securities, could reduce our investment income and couldcause us to incur investment losses. Further, we invest a portion of our assets in equitysecurities and limited partnerships, which may be subject to greater volatility than our fixedincome investments. In some cases, limited partnerships use leverage and are thereby subject toeven greater volatility. Although limited partnership investments generally provide higherexpected return, they present greater risk and are more illiquid than our fixed income investments.As a result of all of these factors, we may not realize an adequate return on our investments, mayincur losses on sales of our investments, and may be required to write down the value of ourinvestments. Therefore, our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strengthand debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.Wehave incurred and may incur further investment losses and may incurunderwriting losses, relating to the sub-prime crisis and therelated credit crisis.We facesub-prime valuation and credit exposure risks within our investment portfolio through our holdingsin corporate asset-backed structured securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)which are typically collateralized with residential mortgages. During the course of 2007, themarket value of some of these securities decreased as a result of the increase in delinquency rateson the underlying mortgages and a decrease in the value of the homes held as collateral for theinvestment. This deterioration of the collateral underlying the securities caused downgrades byrating agencies, decreased liquidity, and led to some securitiesgoing into default and has led to a material adverse impact onfinancial markets generally. The potentialfor higher delinquency and default rates may continue to adversely impact our sub-prime marketvaluations. In addition, the process of validating fair valuesprovided by third parties for securities that are not regularlytraded requires significant judgment on our part. Accordingly, we mayconclude that other-than-temporary write downs of these securities are required or we mayexperience unanticipated losses in other sectors of our overall investment portfolio.Consequently, our results of operations, equity, business and insurerfinancial strength and debt ratings could be materially adverselyimpacted.We provide management and professional liability insurance and surety bonds to businesses engagedin finance, professional services and real estate. Many of these businesses have exposure directlyor indirectly to the sub-prime crisis and the related credit crisis. As a result, we mayexperience unanticipated underwriting losses with respect to theselines of business. Consequently, our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debtratings could be materially adversely impacted.We face intense competition in our industry and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature ofthe property and casualty business.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocateresources to refine and improve our insurance products and services. We compete with a largenumber of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors andcustomers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratingsand financial strength. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive insuranceproducts at lower prices. The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periodscharacterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwritingstandards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels ofcompetition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. As a result,our premium levels, expense ratio, results of operations, equity, business and insurer financialstrength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.We may suffer losses from non-routine litigation and arbitration matters which may exceed thereserves we have established.We face substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims and A&Ematters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered by reserves that we haveestablished. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify and may seek recovery of verylarge or indeterminate amounts that include punitive or treble damages. Accordingly, unfavorableresults in these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations,equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings.Additional information on litigation is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note G to theConsolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.15Table of ContentsWe are dependent on a small number of key executives and other key personnel to operate ourbusiness successfully.Our success substantially depends upon our ability to attract and retain high quality keyexecutives and other employees. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualifiedexecutives in the business lines in which we compete. We rely substantially upon the services ofour executive officers to implement our business strategy. The loss of the services of any membersof our management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impedethe implementation of our business strategies. We do not maintain key man life insurance policieswith respect to any of our employees"
10,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2007-02-23,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which weface. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceiveto be significant that may also impact our business. Each of the risks and uncertainties describedbelow could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operations, financial condition or equity. You should carefully consider and evaluate allof the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with theSecurities and Exchange Commission or make available to the public before investing in anysecurities we issue.If we determine that loss reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaidliability for claims, we may need to increase our loss reserves.We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claimadjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reservesrepresent our best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exactcalculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing avariety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about futureevents, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency ofclaims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling, case reservingpolicies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatoryenvironment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of itsultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and requiresignificant judgment on our part. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-calledlong tail or long duration coverages, we are sometimes required to add to our reserves. This iscalled unfavorable development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the addedreserves, recorded in the8Table of Contentsperiod the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial and can have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and equity. Additional information on our reserves isincluded in Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) under Item 7 and Note F to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements included under Item 8.We are subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverages issues thatarise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditionschange. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business by eitherextending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size ofclaims, resulting in further increases in our reserves which can have a material adverse effect onour results of operations and equity. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim andcoverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverageissues include: increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical products;  the effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other major corporate governance failures,which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims, including director and officer and errors andomissions insurance claims;  class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices;  construction defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional insured endorsements on policies;  clergy abuse claims, including passage of legislation to reopen or extend various statutes of limitations; and  mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to silica, welding rods, benzene, lead and variousother chemical exposure claims.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making theassumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in aregular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. Inaddition, we periodically undergo state regulatory financial examinations, including review andanalysis of our reserves. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the requiredincrease in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings for the period in whichreserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges can be substantial and can materiallyadversely affect our results of operations and equity.Loss reserves for asbestos, environmental pollution and mass torts are especially difficult toestimate and may result in more frequent and larger additions to these reserves.Our experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to asbestos,environmental pollution and mass tort (which we refer to as APMT) claim and claim adjustmentexpenses is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by otherclaims. Estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported asbestos, environmentalpollution and mass tort claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number ofadditional factors including, among others, the following: coverage issues including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits apply;  inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories;  increasingly aggressive tactics of plaintiffs lawyers;  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;  changes in the volume of asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort claims which cannot now beanticipated;  continued increases in mass tort claims relating to silica and silica-containing products;  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on any umbrella or excesspolicies we have issued;  the number and outcome of direct actions against us;9Table of Contents our ability to recover reinsurance for these claims; and  changes in the legal and legislative environment in which we operate.As a result of this higher degree of variability, we have necessarily supplemented traditionalactuarial methods and techniques with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many ofwhich involve significant judgment on our part. Consequently, we may periodically need to recordchanges in our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future in these areas in amountsthat may be material. Additional information on APMT is included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note F tothe Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.     Environmental pollution claims. The estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claimsis complicated by the assertion by many policyholders of claims for defense costs andindemnification. We and others in the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many suchclaims. Key coverage issues in these claims include the following: whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and accordingly whether we would be liablefor these costs);  the trigger of coverage and the allocation of liability among triggered policies;  the applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions;  the potential for joint and several liability; and  the definition of an occurrence.To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding to theuncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.Further, the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability andinsurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensivelitigation.

For example, in 2005, we experienced substantiallosses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and in 2004, we experienced substantial losses fromHurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. The extent of our losses from catastrophes is afunction of both the total amount of our insured exposures in the affected areas and the severityof the events themselves. In addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take along time for the ultimate cost to us to be finally determined. As our claim experience develops ona particular catastrophe, we may be required to adjust our reserves, or take additional unfavorabledevelopment, to reflect our revised estimates of the total cost of claims. We believe we could incursignificant catastrophe losses in the future. Additional information on catastrophe losses isincluded in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements includedunder Item 8.Our key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long termcare product offerings could vary significantly.Our reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long term care product offerings are based oncertain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness,sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remainingin force, interest rates and/or future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs fromthese assumptions, the deferred acquisition costs may not be fully recovered and the reserves maynot be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development. Therefore, ourfinancial results could be adversely impacted.We continue to face exposure to losses arising from terrorist acts, despite the passage of theTerrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005.We may bear substantial losses from future acts of terrorism. The Terrorism Risk Insurance ExtensionAct of 2005 (TRIEA) extended, until December 31, 2007, the program established by the TerrorismRisk Insurance Act of 2002. Under this program, insurers are required to offer terrorism insuranceand the federal government will share the risk of loss by commercial property and casualty insurersarising from future terrorist attacks. TRIEA does not provide complete protection for future lossesderived from acts of terrorism. Additional information on TRIEA is included in the MD&A under Item7.High levels of retained overhead expenses associated with business lines in run-off negativelyimpact our operating results.During the past few years, we ceased offering certain insurance products relating principally toour life, group and reinsurance segments. Many of these business lines were sold, others have beenplaced in run-off and, as a result, revenue will progressively decrease. Our results of operationshave been materially, adversely affected by the high levels of retained overhead expensesassociated with these run-off operations, and will continue to be so affected if we are notsuccessful in eliminating or reducing these costs.Our premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk. Under our reinsurance arrangements,another insurer assumes a specified portion of our claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchangefor a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost ofthe reinsurance protection we purchase,11Table of Contentswhich affects the level of our business and profitability, as well as the level and types of riskwe retain. If we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may beunwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of our underwritingcommitments. Additional information on Reinsurance is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note Hto the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in ourbalance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expensereserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, dischargeour primary liability for claims. As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our abilityto recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of our reinsurance carriers have experienceddeteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies. In addition,reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us. If we are not able to collect theamounts due to us from reinsurers, our claims expenses will be higher which could materiallyadversely affect our results of operations or equity. Additional information on reinsurance isincluded in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements includedunder Item 8.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to writeinsurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurancecompanies. Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by four majorrating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company, Inc., Standard & Poors Rating Services, MoodysInvestors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc. Ratings reflect the rating agencys opinions of an insurancecompanys financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position andability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debtholders. Agency ratings are not arecommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time bythe issuing organization. Each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any otheragencys rating.Due to the intense competitive environment in which we operate, the uncertainty in determiningreserves and the potential for us to take material unfavorable development in the future, andpossible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agenciesmay take action to lower our ratings in the future. If our property and casualty insurance financialstrength ratings are downgraded below current levels, our business and results of operations couldbe materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on thelevel of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among theadverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volumeof business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of ourinsurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future paymentobligations or reserves.In addition, we believe that a lowering of the debt ratings of Loews Corporation by certain of therating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change in ourcircumstances. We have entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contractsthat require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if our ratings orother specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more thanone level below our current ratings. Additional information on our ratings is included in the MD&Aunder Item 7.We are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations thatrestrict our ability to do business and generate revenues.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervisionthroughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests ofour policyholders rather than our investors. Each state in which we do business has establishedsupervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business. Their regulations relate to,among other things, the following: standards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements;  restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;  restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance;  the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;12Table of Contents the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;  potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failedinsurance companies;  licensing of insurers and agents;  approval of policy forms; and  limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not beexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The states in which we do business also require usto provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible. Each state dictatesthe types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntaryrisks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respectiveshare of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we do not meet these requirements,regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as us are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulatorsto help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specifiedrisk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our statutory capital and surplusreported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules require companiesto maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using therisk-based capital formula. If we do not meet these minimum requirements, state regulators mayrestrict or prohibit us from operating our business. If we are required to record a charge againstearnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances, we may violate these minimumcapital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raise sufficient additional capital. Examples ofevents leading us to record a charge against earnings include impairment of our investments orunexpectedly poor claims experience.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends in order to fund our working capitalneeds, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from oursubsidiaries in order to meet our obligations. Dividend payments, however, must be approved by thesubsidiaries domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amountsdetermined by formula which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states is thegreater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less theaggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment. Some states,however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior years earnedsurplus. If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receivinginter-company dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt servicerequirements from available cash. As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capitalwhich may be more expensive or may not be available at all.We are responding to subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to insurance brokers andagents, contingent commissions and bidding practices, and certain finite-risk insurance products.Along with other companies in the industry, we have received subpoenas, interrogatories andinquiries from: (i) California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan,Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginiaand the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators concerning investigations into practices includingcontingent compensation arrangements, fictitious quotes, and tying arrangements; (ii) theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York State Attorney General, the United StatesAttorney for the Southern District of New York, the Connecticut Attorney General, the ConnecticutDepartment of Insurance, the Delaware Department of Insurance, the Georgia Office of Insurance andSafety Fire Commissioner and the California Department of Insurance concerning reinsurance productsand finite insurance products purchased and sold by us; (iii) the Massachusetts Attorney Generaland the Connecticut Attorney General concerning investigations into anti-competitive practices; and(iv) the New York State Attorney General concerning declinations of attorney malpractice insurance.We continue to respond to these subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries to the extent they arestill open.Subsequent to receipt of the SEC subpoena, we produced documents and provided additionalinformation at the SECs request. In addition, the SEC and representatives of the United StatesAttorneys Office for the Southern District of New York conducted interviews with several of ourcurrent and former executives relating to the13Table of Contentsrestatement of our financial results for 2004, including our relationship with and accounting fortransactions with an affiliate that were the basis for the restatement. The SEC also requestedinformation relating to our restatement in 2006 of prior period results. It is possible that ouranalyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance contracts or discontinued operationscould be questioned or disputed by regulatory authorities. As a result, further restatements of ourfinancial results are possible.In prior years, we restated our financial results and identified material weaknesses in ourinternal control over financial reporting.In May of 2005 we restated our financial results for prior years to correct our accounting forseveral reinsurance contracts, primarily with a former affiliate, and to correct our equityaccounting for that affiliate. In February of 2006 we restated our financial results for prior yearsto correct the accounting for discontinued operations acquired in our merger with The ContinentalCorporation in 1995. Additionally, in March of 2006, we restated our financial results for prioryears to correct classification errors within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.As a result of the foregoing restatements, we identified material weaknesses in our internalcontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. We also determinedthat our internal control over financial reporting as of such dates was not effective. Our system ofinternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance toour management, Audit Committee and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our financialreporting and the preparation and fair presentation of our published financial statements. Pursuantto Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the implementing rules of the Securities andExchange Commission, the periodic reports we file with the SEC include information on our system ofdisclosure controls and procedures, as well as our overall internal control over financialreporting.While we have remediated the referenced material weaknesses, if we fail to maintain effectiveinternal control over financial reporting, we could be scrutinized by regulators in a manner thatextends beyond the SECs requests for information relating to the restatements (as furtherdescribed in the prior risk factor). We could also be scrutinized by securities analysts andinvestors. As a result of this scrutiny, we could suffer a loss of public confidence in ourfinancial reporting capabilities and thereby face adverse effects on our business and the marketprice of our securities.Our investment portfolio, which is a key component of our overall profitability, may suffer reducedreturns or losses, especially with respect to our equity in various limited partnership net assetswhich are often subject to greater leverage and volatility.Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability. General economic conditions,stock market conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, and many other factors beyond our controlcan adversely affect the returns and the overall value of our equity investments and our ability tocontrol the timing of the realization of investment income. In addition, any defaults in thepayments due to us for our investments, especially with respect to liquid corporate and municipalbonds, could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or could cause us to incurinvestment losses. Further, we invest a portion of our assets in equity investments, primarilythrough limited partnerships, which are subject to greater volatility than our fixed incomeinvestments. In some cases, these limited partnerships use leverage and are thereby subject to evengreater volatility. Although limited partnership investments generally provide higher expectedreturn, they present greater risk and are more illiquid than our fixed income investments. As aresult of these factors, we may not realize an adequate return on our investments, may incur losseson sales of our investments and may be required to write down the value of our investments.We may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized byrelatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relativelylow premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selectiveunderwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.We face intense competition in our industry.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocateresources to refine and improve our insurance products and services. Insurers compete on the basisof factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. We may lose businessto competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. We compete with a largenumber of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors andcustomers. In addition, the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 has encouraged14Table of Contentsgrowth in the number, size and financial strength of our potential competitors by removing barriersthat previously prohibited holding companies from simultaneously owning commercial banks, insurersand securities firms.We may suffer losses from non-routine litigation and arbitration matters which may exceed thereserves we have established.We face substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims and APMTmatters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered by reserves that we haveestablished. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify and may seek recovery of verylarge or indeterminate amounts that include punitive or treble damages. Accordingly, unfavorableresults in these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Additional information on litigation is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note G to theConsolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We are dependent on a small number of key executives and other key personnel to operate ourbusiness successfully.Our success substantially depends upon our ability to attract and retain high quality keyexecutives and other employees. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualifiedexecutives in the business lines in which we compete. We rely substantially upon the services of ourexecutive officers to implement our business strategy. The loss of the services of any members ofour management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impedethe implementation of our business strategies. We do not maintain key man life insurance policieswith respect to any of our employees"
15,CNA,CNA FINANCIAL CORP,2006-03-08,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which weface. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currentlyperceive to be significant that may also impact our business. Each of the risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations, financial condition or equity. You should carefully consider andevaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file withthe Securities and Exchange Commission or make available to the public before investing in anysecurities we issue.If we determine that loss reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaidliability for claims, we may need to increase our loss reserves.We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claimadjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reservesrepresent our best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exactcalculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing avariety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about futureevents, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency ofclaims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling, case reservingpolicies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatoryenvironment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of itsultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and requiresignificant judgment on our part. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly inso-called long tail or long duration coverages, we are sometimes required to add to our reserves.This is called unfavorable development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount ofthe added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can besubstantial and can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity.Additional information on our reserves is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)under Item 7 and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.As industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other environmental conditions change,unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues have had and maycontinue to have a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond ourunderwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increasesin our reserves which can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity.The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard topredict. Recent examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include the following: increases in the number and size of claims relating toinjuries from medical products and exposure to lead;  the effects of accounting and financial reportingscandals and other major corporate governance failures whichhave resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims,including director and officer and errors and omissionsinsurance claims;  increases in the volume of class action litigationchallenging a range of industry practices including claimshandling;  increases in the number of construction defect claims,including claims for a broad range of additional insuredendorsements on policies; and  increases in the number of claims alleging abuse bymembers of the clergy, including passage of legislation toreopen or extend various statutes of limitations.In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making theassumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in aregular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. Inaddition, we periodically undergo state regulatory financial examinations, including review andanalysis of our reserves. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the requiredincrease in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings for the period in whichreserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges can be substantial and can materiallyadversely affect our results of operations and equity.Loss reserves for asbestos, environmental pollution and mass torts are especially difficult toestimate and may result in more frequent and larger additions to these reserves.9Table of ContentsOur experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to asbestos,environmental pollution and mass tort (which we refer to as APMT) claim and claim adjustmentexpenses is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.Estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported asbestos, environmental pollution andmass tort claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of additional factorsincluding, among others, the following: coverage issues including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits apply;  inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories;  increasingly aggressive tactics of plaintiffs lawyers;  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;  changes in the volume of asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort claims which cannot now beanticipated;  continued increases in mass tort claims relating to silica and silica-containing products;  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on any umbrella or excesspolicies we have issued;  the number and outcome of direct actions against us;  our ability to recover reinsurance for these claims; and  changes in the legal and legislative environment in which we operate.As a result of this higher degree of variability, we have necessarily supplemented traditionalactuarial methods and techniques with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many ofwhich involve significant judgment on our part. Consequently, we may periodically need to recordchanges in our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future in these areas in amountsthat may be material. Additional information on APMT is included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note Fto the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.     Environmental pollution claims. The estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claimsis complicated by the assertion by many policyholders of claims for defense costs andindemnification. We and others in the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many suchclaims. Key coverage issues in these claims include the following: whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and accordingly whether we would be liablefor these costs);  the trigger of coverage and the allocation of liability among triggered policies;  the applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions;  the potential for joint and several liability; and  the definition of an occurrence.To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding to theuncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.Further, the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability andinsurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensivelitigation. In many cases, courts have expanded the scope of coverage and liability for cleanupcosts beyond the original intent of our insurance policies. Additionally, the standards for cleanupin environmental pollution matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject to cleanupunder applicable laws is unknown, and the impact of various proposals to reform existing statutesand regulations is difficult to predict.     Asbestos claims. The estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult formany of the same reasons discussed above for environmental pollution claims, as well as thefollowing:10Table of Contents inconsistency of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court decisions;  specific policy provisions;  allocation of liability among insurers and insureds;  missing policies and proof of coverage;  the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties;  novel theories asserted by policyholders and their legal counsel;  the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants;  uncertainties in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds may be targeted in the future;  volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands;  increases in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can be precluded from makingclaims;  the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to aggregate limits;  the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation, as well as the resultingpotential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims;  medical inflation trends;  the mix of asbestos-related diseases presented; and  the ability to recover reinsurance.In addition, a number of our insureds have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subjectto aggregate limits on coverage. If these insureds are successful in this regard, our potentialliability for their claims would be unlimited. Some of these insureds contend that their asbestosclaims fall within the so-called non-products liability coverage within their policies, ratherthan the products liability coverage, and that this non-products liability coverage is notsubject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the extent to which these claims willsucceed and, as a result, the ultimate size of these claims.Catastrophe losses are unpredictable.Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of our business. Various events can cause catastrophelosses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, severe winter weather andfires, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. For example, in 2005, weexperienced substantial losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and in 2004, we experiencedsubstantial losses from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. These catastrophes areunprecedented in modern times. The extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of both thetotal amount of insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves.In addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for theultimate cost to us to be finally determined. As our claim experience develops on a particularcatastrophe, we may be required to adjust our reserves, or take additional unfavorable development,to reflect our revised estimates of the total cost of claims. We believe we could incursignificant catastrophe losses in the future. Additional information on catastrophe losses isincluded in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements includedunder Item 8.Our key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long-termcare product offerings could vary significantly.Our reserves and deferred acquisition costs for our long-term care product offerings are based oncertain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency of illness, sickness anddiseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remaining in force,interest rates, future premium increases and future health care cost trends. If actual experiencediffers from these assumptions, the deferred acquisition costs may not be fully recovered and thereserves may not be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development.Therefore, our financial results could be adversely impacted.11Table of ContentsWe continue to face exposure to losses arising from terrorist acts, despite the passage of theTerrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005.We may bear substantial losses from future acts of terrorism. The Terrorism Risk InsuranceExtension Act of 2005 (TRIEA) extended, until December 31, 2007, the program established by theTerrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. Under this program, insurers are required to offer terrorisminsurance and the federal government will share the risk of loss by commercial property andcasualty insurers arising from future terrorist attacks. TRIEA does not provide completeprotection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism. Additional information on TRIEA isincluded in the MD&A under Item 7.High levels of retained overhead expenses associated with business lines in run-off negativelyimpact our operating results.During the past few years, we ceased offering certain insurance products relating principally toour life, group and reinsurance segments. Many of these business lines were sold, others have beenplaced in run-off and revenue will progressively decrease. Our results of operations have beenmaterially, adversely affected by the high levels of retained overhead expenses associated withthese run-off operations, and will continue to be so affected if we are not successful ineliminating or reducing these costs.Our premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.We purchase reinsurance to help manage our exposure to risk. Under our reinsurance arrangements,another insurer assumes a specified portion of our claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchangefor a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and costof the reinsurance protection we purchase, which affects the level of our business andprofitability, as well as the level and types of risk we retain. If we are unable to obtainsufficient reinsurance at a cost we deem acceptable, we may be unwilling to bear the increased riskand would reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Additional information on Reinsuranceis included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements includedItem 8.We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us by reinsurers.We have significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in ourbalance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expensereserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, dischargeour primary liability for claims. As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to ourability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of our reinsurance carriers haveexperienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies. Inaddition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which we believe are due to us. If we are not able tocollect the amounts due to us from reinsurers, our claims expenses will be higher which couldmaterially adversely affect our results of operations or equity. Additional information onReinsurance is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note H to the Consolidated FinancialStatements included under Item 8.We incur significant interest expense related to funds withheld from reinsurance arrangements.We have entered into several property and casualty reinsurance agreements where we retain the cededpremium as collateral to secure the reinsurers obligations to pay for ceded losses. We arerequired to credit interest on these funds withheld balances at specified rates for all periodsin which the funds withheld liability exists. In addition, certain of these reinsurance contractsrequire us to pay interest on additional ceded premiums arising from ceded losses as if thosepremiums were payable at the inception of the underlying contract. The amount subject to interestcrediting on these funds withheld contracts varies over time based on a number of factors includingthe timing of loss payments and the ultimate gross losses incurred. We expect to incur significantinterest costs on these contracts for several years to come. In an effort to reduce futureinterest charges, resolve a dispute or unwind an arrangement with a reinsurer that is experiencingfinancial difficulties, from time to time, we commute or buy out reinsurance arrangements fromcertain reinsurance carriers. Commutations can result in our incurring a significant charge in ourresults of operations for the period in which the commutation takes place. Additional informationon reinsurance is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note H to the Consolidate FinancialStatements included under Item 8.Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of us and thereby adversely affect our ability to writeinsurance at competitive rates or at all.Ratings are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurancecompanies. Our insurance company subsidiaries, as well as our public debt, are rated by four majorrating agencies, namely, A.M.12Table of ContentsBest Company, Inc., Standard & Poors Rating Services, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch,Inc. Ratings reflect the rating agencys opinions of an insurance companys financial strength,operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders anddebtholders. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may berevised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agencys rating should beevaluated independently of any other agencys rating.In the past several years, the major rating agencies have lowered our financial strength and debtratings and due to the intense competitive environment in which we operate, the uncertainty indetermining reserves and the potential for us to take material unfavorable development in thefuture, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, therating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future. If our property and casualtyinsurance financial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels, our business and resultsof operations could be materially adversely affected. Among the adverse effects in the event ofsuch downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain majorinsurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certainmarkets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.In addition, we believe that a lowering of the debt ratings of Loews Corporation by certain of therating agencies could result in an adverse impact on our ratings, independent of any change incircumstances at CNA. Each of the major rating agencies that rates Loews currently maintains anegative outlook. Additional information on our ratings is included in the MD&A under Item 7.We are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations thatrestrict our ability to do business and generate revenues.The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervisionthroughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests ofour policyholders rather than our investors. Each state in which we do business has establishedsupervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which we do business. Their regulations relateto, among other things, the following: standards of solvency including risk-based capital measurements;  restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;  restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance;  the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;  the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;  potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failedinsurance companies;  licensing of insurers and agents;  approval of policy forms; and  limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not beexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The states in which we do business also requireus to provide coverage to persons whom we would not otherwise consider eligible. Each statedictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntaryrisks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of ourrespective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.We are subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if we do not meet these requirements,regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business.Insurance companies such as us are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulatorsto help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards applyspecified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our statutory capitaland surplus reported in our statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rulesrequire companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determinedusing the risk-based capital formula. If we do not meet these minimum requirements, stateregulators may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business. If we are required to record acharge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances, such asincreasing our reserves in the future as a13Table of Contentsresult of unexpectedly poor claims experience or recording realized losses due to impairment of ourinvestments, we may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless we are able to raisesufficient additional capital.Our insurance subsidiaries, upon whom we depend for dividends and advances in order to fund ourworking capital needs, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, advances, loans and other sources ofcash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations. Dividend payments, however, must beapproved by the subsidiaries domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limitedto amounts determined by formula which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the statesis the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income,less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment.Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior yearsearned surplus. If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receivinginter-company dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt servicerequirements from available cash. As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capitalwhich may be more expensive or may not be available at all.We are responding to subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to insurance brokers andagents, contingent commissions and bidding practices, and certain finite-risk insurance products.Along with other companies in the industry, we have received subpoenas, interrogatories andinquiries from: (i) California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, NewJersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and theCanadian Council of Insurance Regulators concerning investigations into practices includingcontingent compensation arrangements, fictitious quotes, and tying arrangements; (ii) theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York State Attorney General, the United StatesAttorney for the Southern District of New York, the Connecticut Attorney General, the ConnecticutDepartment of Insurance, the Delaware Department of Insurance, the Georgia Office of Insurance andSafety Fire Commissioner and the California Department of Insurance concerning reinsurance productsand finite insurance products purchased and sold by us; (iii) the Massachusetts Attorney Generaland the Connecticut Attorney General concerning investigations into anti-competitive practices; and(iv) the New York State Attorney General concerning declinations of attorney malpractice insurance.We continue to respond to these subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries.Subsequent to receipt of the SEC subpoena, we have been producing documents and providing additionalinformation at the SECs request. In addition, the SEC andrepresentatives of the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York have been conducting interviews with severalof our current and former executives relating to the restatement of our financial results for 2004,including our relationship with and accounting for transactions with an affiliate that were thebasis for the restatement. The SEC has also recently requested information relating to our currentrestatement. It is possible that our analyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurancecontracts or discontinued operations could be questioned or disputed by regulatory authorities. As a result, furtherrestatements of our financial results are possible.We have restated our financial results for prior years and identified material weaknesses in ourinternal control over financial reporting.In February of 2006 we determined that we would restate our annual financial statements forthe years 2001 through 2004, as well as our interim financial statements through September30, 2005, to correct the accounting for discontinued operations acquired in our merger withThe Continental Corporation in 1995. Additionally, in March of 2006, we determined torestate our financial results for prior years to correct classification errors within ourConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In May of 2005 we determined to restate ourfinancial results for prior years to correct our accounting for several reinsurancecontracts, primarily with a former affiliate, and to correct our equity accounting for thataffiliate.As a result of the foregoing restatements, we identified material weaknesses in our internalcontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, anddetermined that our prior year financial statements could not be relied upon. We alsodetermined that our internal control over financial reporting as of such dates was noteffective. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed toprovide reasonable assurance to our management, Audit Committee and Board of Directorsregarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation and fairpresentation of our published financial statements.14Table of ContentsIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we could bescrutinized by regulators in a manner that extends beyond the SECs requests for informationrelating to the restatements (as further described in the prior risk factor). We could alsobe scrutinized by securities analysts and investors. As a result of this scrutiny, we couldsuffer a loss of public confidence in our financial reporting capabilities and thereby faceadverse effects on our business and the market price of our securities.Our investment portfolio, which is a key component of our overall profitability, may suffer reducedreturns or losses, especially with respect to our equity investments in limited partnerships whichare often subject to greater leverage and volatility.Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability. General economicconditions, stock market conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, and many other factors beyondour control can adversely affect the returns and the overall value of our equity investments andour ability to control the timing of the realization of investment income. In addition, anydefaults in the payments due to us for our investments, especially with respect to liquid corporateand municipal bonds, could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or couldcause us to incur investment losses. Further, we invest a portion of our assets in equityinvestments, primarily through limited partnerships, which are subject to greater volatility thanour fixed income investments. In some cases, these limited partnerships use leverage and arethereby subject to even greater volatility. Although limited partnership investments generallyprovide higher expected return, they present greater risk and are more illiquid than our fixedincome investments. As a result of these factors, we may not realize an adequate return on ourinvestments, may incur losses on sales of our investments and may be required to write down thevalue of our investments.We may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized byrelatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relativelylow premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selectiveunderwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.We face intense competition in our industry.All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocateresources to refine and improve our insurance products and services. Insurers compete on the basisof factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. We may losebusiness to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. We compete with alarge number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors andcustomers. In addition, the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 has encouraged growth in the number,size and financial strength of our potential competitors by removing barriers that previouslyprohibited holding companies from simultaneously owning commercial banks, insurers and securitiesfirms.We may suffer losses from non-routine litigation and arbitration matters which may exceed thereserves we have established.We face substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims and APMTmatters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered by reserves that we haveestablished. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify and may seek recovery of verylarge or indeterminate amounts that include punitive or treble damages. Accordingly, unfavorable results in theseproceedings could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.15Table of ContentsAdditional information on litigation is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note G to theConsolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.We are dependent on a small number of key executives and other key personnel to operate ourbusiness successfully.Our success substantially depends upon our ability to attract and retain high quality keyexecutives and other employees. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualifiedexecutives in the business lines in which we compete. We rely substantially upon the services ofour executive officers to implement our business strategy. The loss of the services of any membersof our management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impedethe implementation of our business strategies. We do not maintain key man life insurance policieswith respect to any of our employees"
