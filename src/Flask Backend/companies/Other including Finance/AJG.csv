Global economic events, including accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, have contributed to significant inflation in many markets in which we operate.  To combat inflation and restore price stability, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks raised interest rates in 2023.  While moderate inflation generally benefits our industry by increasing insurable asset values, increased inflation and higher interest rates have had far-reaching negative effects on the global economy during the past several years.  Geopolitical conflicts such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, geo-economic fragmentation, climate change, the transition to a low-carbon economy, political crises like potential U.S. governmental shutdowns or gridlock over increasing the U.S. debt ceiling, and political violence and instability worldwide could also weigh negatively on the economy. A recession or decline in economic activity, for these and any other reasons, could adversely impact us in future periods.  This could happen, for example, if our clients reduce the amount of insurance coverage, reinsurance coverage, consulting services or 12 claims administration services they purchase due to reductions in headcount, payroll, or replacement and asset values, among other factors.  Whether these reductions are caused by an overall economic downturn or declines in certain countries, regions and industries in which we operate, our commission and fee revenues, consulting revenues, or revenues from managing third-party insurance claims could be adversely impacted.  Some of our clients may also experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties due to tightening credit markets or lower levels of economic activity.  If our clients file for bankruptcy, liquidate their operations, consolidate or are generally unable to meet their obligations, our revenues, ability to collect receivables and liquidity could be adversely impacted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain economic conditions have created volatility in the U.S. and other markets where we operate.  A rise in the cost of labor, cost of capital, or interest and tax rates, among other things, could negatively impact our operating and general and administrative expenses.  We have no or limited control over such developments.  If our costs grow significantly, our margins and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives.  Further, a tightening of credit or capital markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity, including our ability to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when needed and under similar terms, which may increase our capital costs.  We could also experience losses on holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other counterparties.  Thus, a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Lower interest rates in the future could reduce investment earnings on our cash, revenue from our premium financing operations and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds.  In addition, lower levels of inflation in the future may reduce our revenue growth by slowing the increase in insurable asset values. Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risk-taking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have a significant amount of receivables from certain of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance and reinsurance.  If those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  The failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in E&O claims against us by our clients.  Further, the failure of E&O underwriting enterprises could make the E&O insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable.  Underwriting enterprises are also clients of Gallagher Re and, as such, any of the negative developments for underwriting enterprises referred to above could also reduce our commission revenues from such clients.  Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, if underwriting enterprises merge, fail, or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage, for example, because of large payouts related to climate or weather events or other emerging risk areas, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage, reduce demand from the insurance company clients of Gallagher Re and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability. We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefit consulting firms and, to a lesser extent, third party claims administration and risk management firms.  We may not be able to continue such acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations. Our ordinary-course acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth, particularly in our brokerage segment, and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future.  Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions would likely result in slower growth.  Continuing consolidation in our industry and a high level of interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms, private equity-backed consolidators and newly public insurance brokers has, in some cases, made, and could in the future make, appropriate acquisition targets more difficult to identify and more expensive.  Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions, be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions.  When regulatory approval of acquisitions is required, our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator.  Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of larger acquisitions than we have historically.  See the risk factor below regarding larger acquisitions.  See also Note 3 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements for information regarding the size of transactions in the reporting period. Post-acquisition risks include poor cultural fit and risks relating to retention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar or complex markets or lines of business, contingencies or liabilities, such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accounting issues, the risk that an acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business, and integration difficulties relating to accounting, information technology (which we refer to as IT), pay equity, or 13 human resources, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth.  The failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges. We face additional risks relating to acquisitions that are larger than our usual tuck-in acquisitions described above. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of acquisitions that are larger than our usual tuck-in acquisitions, such as Willis Re, Buck, Eastern Insurance, Cadence Insurance and My Plan Manager, that they will perform as expected, or that we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities.  Integration efforts relating to larger acquisitions are more complex, including with respect to technology systems, which may divert management’s attention and resources and could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we have made certain assumptions relating to these acquisitions that may be inaccurate, including as a result of the failure to realize expected benefits, higher than expected integration costs and unknown liabilities as well as general economic and business conditions.  These assumptions relate to various matters, including projections of future revenues, non-GAAP measures, expenses and expense allocation; our ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with employees, including key brokers, and clients; the amount of goodwill and intangibles; and other unforeseen compliance, financial and strategic risks. Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our reputation is one of our key assets.  We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our expertise, level of service, ability to protect client information, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities such as ethics, culture and values.  Our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential employees, investors, regulators and the communities in which we operate.  Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters, including our association with clients or business partners with damaged reputations, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees, including corruption or bribery allegations (for example, those in connection with the previously-disclosed investigation of our business in Ecuador) or cybersecurity incidents (for example, as disclosed in previous filings, we experienced a ransomware attack in 2020) could damage our reputation.  Negative publicity resulting from one of our marketing partnerships (for example, with a sports team or league) could damage our brand and/or our reputation.  Our reputation could also be harmed by negative perceptions or publicity regarding sustainability or ESG matters, including concerns with environmental, climate change, workforce diversity, political spending, pay equity, harassment, racial justice, cybersecurity and data privacy matters, as well as backlash against sustainability or ESG initiatives generally.  Negative publicity may be posted on social media or other Internet forums, whether or not true, and the speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify the risks noted above.  Any resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain clients, employees or investors; result in lower ESG ratings, exclusion of our stock from ESG-oriented indices, and reduced demand for our stock from ESG-focused investment funds; increase our cost of borrowing; or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate.  Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  As we venture into new jurisdictions and markets globally, negative reputational events (whether arising from regulatory matters or otherwise) may have a disproportionate impact in locations or markets where our employee and client presence is limited.  Any negative publicity could potentially hinder our growth prospects in such locations or markets.  See below for additional risk factors regarding climate change and ESG initiatives and disclosures. Our ESG-related aspirations, goals and initiatives, and our statements and disclosures regarding ESG-related matters, expose us to numerous risks.The increased focus on ESG issues has made compliance with regulations, frameworks and stakeholder expectations increasingly complex.  Our business faces increased scrutiny from the investment community, clients, employees, potential acquisition targets, regulators and other stakeholders related to our ESG activities.  This includes scrutiny regarding our goal to reach Net Zero carbon emissions in our direct operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2050 and our interim goal of 50% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions, on a per employee basis, by 2030.  We anticipate the same level of scrutiny with respect to any other goals, targets and objectives we may announce in the future, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them.  Heightened scrutiny has increased the risk that we could be perceived as, or accused of, making inaccurate or misleading statements, commonly referred to as “greenwashing.”  If our ESG practices and disclosures do not comply with regulations or align with stakeholder expectations and standards, which are continuously evolving, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner or as an acquirer could be negatively impacted.  Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental or other standards, regulations or expectations or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, could have the same negative impacts, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.  See also “We are subject 14 to regulation worldwide.  If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable.” If we are unable to apply technology and data analytics effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the risks and opportunities presented by digital disruption, “big data” and data analytics, AI and other developments in technology.  These may include new applications or insurance-related services based on AI (e.g., generative AI, machine learning), robotics, blockchain, the metaverse or new approaches to data mining that impact the nature of how we generate revenue.  We may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants (for example, through disintermediation or use of the metaverse) or new entrants such as technology companies, “Insurtech” start-up companies, and others.  These new entrants are focused on using technology and innovation in an attempt to simplify and improve the client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate.  We must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards.  We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace.  Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise, make use of data analytics, and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses.  Investments in technology systems and data analytics capabilities may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected, or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs.  If we cannot offer new technologies or data analytics solutions as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, data analytics solutions or other product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth, and compliance programs. In some cases, we depend on key third-party vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives.  If these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected.  See also “We are subject to risks associated with AI.”We are subject to risks associated with AI. We use AI in our business, including with respect to services provided to our clients.  We have internal policies governing the use of AI by our employees designed to protect the company from breaches of data privacy, E&O liability and regulatory enforcement risk; however, our employees could violate these policies and expose us to such risks.  Furthermore, our exposure to these risks may increase if our vendors, suppliers, or other third-party providers employ AI in relation to the products or services they provide to us, as we have limited control over such use in third-party products or services.  These risks include, among others, the input of confidential information, including material non-public information, in contravention of our policies or contractual restrictions to which any of the foregoing are subject, or in violation of applicable laws or regulations, including those relating to data protection.  This could result in such information becoming part of a dataset that is accessible by other third-party AI applications and users. Additionally, AI heavily relies on the collection and analysis of extensive data sets.  Due to the impracticality of incorporating all relevant data into the models used by AI, it is inevitable that data sets within these models will contain inaccuracies and errors, and potential biases.  This could potentially render such models inadequate or flawed, negatively impacting the effectiveness of the technology.  We are exposed to the risks associated with these inaccuracies, errors and biases, along with the adverse impacts that such flawed models could have on our business and operations.  Furthermore, governance and ethical issues relating to the use of AI may also result in reputational harm and liability. AI and its applications are developing rapidly.  The use of this technology by our competitors may give them a competitive advantage that cannot be predicted at this time, and it may negatively affect our assumptions regarding the competitive landscape of our business.  Consequently, it is difficult to predict all risks associated with this new technology, which may eventually impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.  See also “Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results.” Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent, including our senior management team. We depend upon members of our senior management team, who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy.  We could be adversely affected if we fail to successfully execute our succession plans for these leaders, including our chief executive officer, and if our succession plans are not well-received by our employees and trading partners.  We could also be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain talent and foster a diverse and inclusive workplace throughout our organization.  Competition for talent is intense in many areas of our business, particularly in our claims management business, IT and in rapidly developing fields such as AI and data engineering.  Furthermore, the increased availability of remote 15 working arrangements has expanded the pool of companies that compete with us for talent.  As competition for skilled professionals remains intense, employers are implementing new offerings to attract talent, including but not limited to increasing compensation, enhancing health and wellness solutions, and providing in-office and remote work options.  We may have to devote significant resources to attract and retain talent, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, our industry has experienced competition for leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers, along with their clients, business relationships and intellectual property directly to our competition.  We enter into agreements with many of our brokers and significant client-facing employees and all of our executive officers, which prohibit them from disclosing confidential information and/or soliciting our clients, prospects and employees upon their termination of employment.  The confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control, as defined in the agreements.  Although we pursue legal actions for alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action, such legal actions may not be effective in preventing such breaches, theft or infringement.  In certain cases, our competitors have solicited employees in violation of their employment agreements as a matter of standard business practice, apparently determining that the cost of defending litigation is outweighed by the benefits of acquiring our employees in this manner.  In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has proposed a rule that would prevent employers from entering into non-competes with employees and require employers to rescind existing non-competes.  Furthermore, certain states like Minnesota, North Dakota and Oklahoma have implemented comparable or more stringent regulations, while California has broadened the scope of its longstanding restrictions on non-competes.  If this rule goes into effect, more states adopt similar rules or if we fail to adequately address any of the issues referred to above, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  See also “The substantial increase in remote work among our employees subjects us to certain challenges and risks” below. The substantial increase in remote work among our employees subjects us to certain challenges and risks.Many of our employees now work from home on a full- or part-time basis.  Remote work for some of our employees could affect their productivity, including due to a lower level of oversight, distractions and disruptions due to caregiving obligations or slower or unreliable Internet access.  Remote work may also make some employees feel detached from colleagues and the organization.  In some cases, this may make them more vulnerable to solicitations by competing firms.  In addition, our increased reliance on work-from-home technologies and our employees’ more frequent use of personal devices and non-standard business processing may increase the risk of cybersecurity or data breaches from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions.The increased prevalence of remote work among our employees may also subject us to other challenges and risks.  For example, our hybrid work environment may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel who prefer a fully remote or fully in-person work environment.  Operating our business with both remote and in-person workers, or workers who work on flexible schedules, could have a negative impact on our corporate culture, decrease the ability of our employees to collaborate and communicate effectively, decrease the ability of newer production and support staff to learn client-handling and other key skills informally around the office, decrease innovation and productivity, or negatively affect employee morale. Business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations, damage our reputation and impact client relationships.Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business.  This includes infrastructure controlled by third-party vendors and suppliers.  Such disruptions could be caused by various factors, such as cybersecurity incidents (for example, as disclosed in previous filings, we experienced a ransomware attack in 2020), security breaches, human error, capacity constraints, hardware failures or defects, natural disasters, climate and weather events, pandemics, fires, power outages, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, civil disruption, political violence and unrest, or war.  While we have disaster recovery procedures in place, they may not be effective.  Additionally, insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all potential losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us.  Further, because we do not control infrastructure owned by third parties, we cannot guarantee that such parties have effective recovery procedures, or sufficient funds or insurance to recover any damages, losses or other liabilities that we may incur due to business interruptions caused by disruptions to their infrastructure. The risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas where a significant portion of our business is concentrated.  For example, we have substantial operations in India that provide important client support and other back-office services for our global organization.  To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, rising tensions between India and China, incidents of terrorism in India, the potential for civil unrest and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India.  However, such factors could potentially affect our operations 16 there in the future.  If our access to these services is disrupted, our client relationships could be harmed, our liability for E&O could increase, and our reputation could be damaged, causing our business, operating results and financial condition to be adversely affected. Sustained increases in compensation expense and the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability. Compensation expense and the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits, substantially affects our profitability.  In the past, we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including wage inflation, increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities.  Our compensation expense ratio in 2023 as a percent of total revenue remained the same as in 2022 at 56%.  A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets, changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities, or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plan’s liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years.  Although we have actively sought to control increases in compensation expense and the cost of employee benefits, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability. Our substantial operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S. In 2023, we generated approximately 36% of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the U.S.  Our business outside the U.S. presents operational, economic and other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S.  These include, among others, risks relating to:•Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to labor and employment, data privacy requirements, AI prohibitions on corrupt payments to government officials, export and import duties, environmental policies, sustainability disclosures, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad.  We are subject to the risk that we, our employees, our agents, or our affiliated entities, or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations or policies, for which we might be held responsible.  Actual or alleged violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.   While we believe that relations with work councils and trade unions in these countries are and will continue to be satisfactory, work stoppages could occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements.  In addition, collective bargaining negotiations may (1) result in significant increases in the cost of labor, (2) divert management’s attention away from operating the business or (3) break down and result in the disruption of operations.  The occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could result in increased costs and impair our ability to operate our business.  These and other international regulatory risks and labor related risks are described below under “Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks”; •We own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as Casanueva Perez S.A.P.I. de C.V. in Mexico and Renomia, A.S. in the Czech Republic) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full ownership;  •The potential costs, difficulties and risks associated with local regulations across the globe, including the risk of personal liability for directors and officers (for example, in the U.K.) and “piercing the corporate veil” risks under the corporate law regimes of certain countries; •Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations.  For example, we are growing our Latin American operations through acquisitions of local family-owned insurance brokerage firms.  If we lose a local key employee, hiring and retaining talent locally or finding an internal candidate qualified to transfer to such location could be difficult;•Less flexible employee relationships, which in certain circumstances has limited our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after they are no longer employed with us or recover damages, and made it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment; •Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies.  We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars.  Although we 17 have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations; •Conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business; •Political and economic instability (including risks relating to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war, including between Russia and Ukraine, and in the Middle East);•Coordinating our communications, policies and logistics across geographic distances, multiple time zones and in different languages, including during times of crisis management; •Risks relating to our post-Brexit plan to address the loss of passporting rights between the U.K. and EU with respect to insurance brokerage services.  Our plan (implemented in September 2020) involved transferring the European Economic Area (EEA) clients of our U.K.-based regulated entities to a Swedish subsidiary authorized in the EEA, and providing some services through a U.K. branch of such subsidiary.  Although this “reverse branch” model is typical of other brokers of a similar size, EU regulators continue to assess their approach to this model, including as a result of, among other developments, the supervisory statement issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in February 2023.  While we are continuously assessing the impact of these developments, it is difficult to predict such impact on our current plan; •Unfavorable audits and exposure to additional liabilities relating to various non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes) in foreign jurisdictions.  In addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, discriminatory or confiscatory taxation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretation and the financial results of our international subsidiaries.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (which we refer to as the OECD) continues to issue reports and recommendations as part of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (which we refer to as BEPS), and in response many countries in which we do business have adopted, or are expected to adopt, rules which will change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined.  For example, the majority of EU countries and the U.K. have incorporated some elements of BEPS Pillar 2 into their national laws.  Other countries in which we have significant operations, such as Australia and Canada, have either announced an intention to adopt it or started the process of doing so.  Additionally, other jurisdictions in which we do business are also reacting to these efforts; for example, Bermuda enacted a corporate tax regime for the first time in 2023.  We anticipate further significant developments across several jurisdictions in which we operate in 2024 and 2025; •Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices; •Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs;  •Epidemics or pandemics at a regional or global level;  •Lost business or other financial harm due to protectionism in the U.S. and in countries around the world, including adverse trade policies, governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency, and governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S.; and •The trade and military policies of the U.S. government could further develop in ways that exacerbate the risks described above, or introduce new risks for our international operations.  If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect us.  We operate in various jurisdictions and are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties, or regulations in those jurisdictions.  A material change in the tax laws, treaties, or regulations, or their interpretation, of any jurisdiction with which we do business, or in which we have significant operations, could adversely affect us.  For example, in October 2021, the OECD announced that 136 countries and tax jurisdictions have agreed to implement a new Pillar 2 approach to international taxation.  The first detailed draft rules under that approach were published in December 2021.  The U.K. and the majority of the EU have adopted some aspects of these rules.  Other countries in which we have significant operations, including Australia and Canada, have announced an intention to adopt it or started the process of doing so.  The new approach came into effect in 2023 in certain jurisdictions, and different countries have implemented the necessary rules in different ways, through their individual agreement to tax treaty changes and through changes to their own domestic tax laws.  Pillar 1 exempts regulated financial institutions and we believe we qualify for such exemption.  Pillar 2 will establish a global minimum tax rate of 15%, such that multinational 18 enterprises with an effective tax rate in a jurisdiction below this minimum rate will need to pay additional tax, which could be collected by the parent company’s tax authorities if that parent country adopts Pillar 2 or by those in other countries, depending on whether and how each country implements the OECD’s approach in its tax treaties and domestic tax legislation.  Depending on how the jurisdictions in which we operate, and those in which we and our subsidiaries are based, choose to implement the OECD’s approach in their tax treaties and domestic tax laws, particularly if the U.S. does not adopt Pillar 2, we could be adversely affected due to our income being taxed at higher effective rates, once these new rules come into force. We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses. The insurance brokerage, reinsurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage, reinsurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world.  Two of the firms we compete with in the global brokerage and risk management markets have larger revenues than ours.  In addition, many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office.  Our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms.  Over the past decade or more, private equity sponsors have invested heavily in the insurance brokerage and third party claims administration industries, creating new competitors and strengthening existing ones.  Across all of our operations, Insurtech and technology-based start-ups are entering the business.  In most cases, these businesses complement or enhance our offerings, but in some cases, they compete with us. We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render, the personalized attention we provide, the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client, our data and analytics capabilities, and our ability to help our clients manage their overall risk exposure and insurance or reinsurance costs.  Losing business to competitors offering similar services or products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business. Consolidation among our existing competitors could create additional competitive pressure on us as such firms grow their market share, take advantage of strategic and operational synergies and develop lower cost structures.  In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us.These developments include:•Increased capital-raising by underwriting enterprises, which could result in new risk-taking capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions; •Underwriting enterprises selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;•Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments; •Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance (such as a single-payer system) or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products currently offered by underwriting enterprises;•Climate-change regulation in the U.S. and around the world moving us toward a low-carbon economy, which could create new competitive pressures around climate resilience consulting services and innovative insurance solutions;  •Continued consolidation in the financial services industry, leading to larger financial services institutions offering a wider variety of services including insurance brokerage and risk management services;  •Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services, or new distribution channels for insurance such as payroll firms and professional employer organizations; and •Third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to our clients.  Their presence in the market increases the competitive pressures that we face.  New competition as a result of these or other legislative or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability. We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services.  We do not determine the premiums on which our commissions are generally based.  Moreover, premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market 19 conditions.  Because of market cycles for insurance and reinsurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time. As underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to agents or brokers.  The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability.  Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to forecast our commission revenues precisely, including whether they will significantly decline.  As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.  In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance and reinsurance markets toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance.  While historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities.  Our ability to generate premium based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than a percentage of premium.  This could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided.  Contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues, and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations.  A meaningful portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises.  Contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period, generally in the first or second quarter, based on the growth and/or profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year.  On the other hand, supplemental revenues are paid up front, on an annual or quarterly basis, generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement.  While underwriting enterprises generally maintain supplemental revenues in the current year at a pre-determined rate, that rate can change in future years as described above.  If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability, volume or growth thresholds, as the case may be, or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  In the case of contingent revenues, under revenue recognition accounting standards, this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods.  We face a variety of risks in our benefit consulting operations distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage operations. Our benefit consulting operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations.  The portion of our revenue derived from consulting engagements and special project work is more vulnerable to reduction, postponement, cancellation or non-renewal during an economic downturn than traditional insurance brokerage commissions. For instance, we experienced a decline in such revenue during the economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the event of a future recession or economic downturn, we could again experience deterioration in these sources of revenue.  A portion of our benefit consulting operation revenue is tied to assets invested by our clients, and when investment returns are adversely affected that portion of our revenue is negatively impacted.  Certain areas within our retirement consulting practice may attract a higher level of regulatory scrutiny due to regulators’ historical interest in such matters, including pension-related products and investment advisory and broker-dealer services.  In addition, we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements relating to employer-sponsored healthcare.  New laws or regulations reducing employer-sponsored health insurance, by limiting or eliminating tax-advantaged employer-sponsored benefits or otherwise, could impact clients’ demand for our services.  If we are unable to adapt our services to changes in the legal and regulatory landscape around employer-sponsored benefits, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. We closed the acquisition of Buck in April 2023.  Buck is the largest acquisition in the history of our benefit consulting operations and represents a material portion of its revenue.  As such, the integration of Buck into our existing operations requires 20 a more significant effort and involves additional risks compared to our typical acquisitions.  See also “We face additional risks relating to acquisitions that are larger than our usual tuck-in acquisitions” described above. We face a variety of risks in our third-party claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage and benefit consulting operations. Our third party claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by the rest of our business, including the risks that: •Epidemics and pandemics that reduce in-person business activity have a greater negative impact because they result in a reduction in the number of claims processed, as experienced during the years 2020, 2021, and the beginning of 2022.  If a new epidemic or pandemic were to emerge, these operations could face similar negative impacts in the future; •RISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, on which our ability to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services is highly dependent, becomes inoperable for some reason.  In addition, we are increasing our use of cloud storage and cloud computing application services supported, upgraded and maintained by third-party vendors.  A disruption affecting RISX-FACS®, third-party cloud services or any other infrastructure supporting our business, including key client relationship management software, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cause reputational harm and damage our employee and client relationships;•The favorable trend among both underwriting enterprises and self-insured entities toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline; •Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due to changes in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients, or for other reasons; •Contracting terms will become less favorable or the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments; •We do not satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or regulatory developments, including those relating to security, cybersecurity and data privacy as we manage a large amount of highly sensitive and confidential information including personally identifiable information, protected health information and financial information, will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable; •Volatility in our case volumes, which are dependent upon a number of factors and difficult to forecast accurately, could impact our revenues; •Wage inflation, difficulty attracting and retaining talent, and rising technology costs, all of which have been challenging to control since 2020, may impact our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection); •We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain clients if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations; and •Underwriting enterprises or certain large self-insured entities may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products, and we could face additional competition from potential new entrants into the global claims management services market.  If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Climate risks, including the risk of an economic crisis, risks associated with the physical effects of climate change and disruptions caused by the transition to a low-carbon economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Climate change has been widely identified by investors and regulators as a systemic risk to the global economy.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has warned that a gradual change in investor sentiment regarding climate risk introduces the possibility of abrupt tipping points or significant swings in sentiment, which could create unpredictable follow-on effects in financial markets.  If this occurred, not only would our business be negatively impacted by the general economic decline, but a drop in the stock 21 market affecting our stock price could negatively impact our ability to grow through mergers and acquisitions financed using our common stock.  The transition to a low-carbon economy could harm specific industries or sectors such as oil and gas in ways that could impact our business.  Our clients in such industries could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurance-related or consulting services, which could adversely impact our commission revenues, consulting revenues or revenues from managing third-party insurance claims.  Negative publicity arising from our association with clients in disfavored businesses or industries, or the perception that we are not sufficiently focused on climate risks facing Gallagher or on reducing our own carbon emissions, as well as resulting from the potential conflict with anti-ESG initiatives from certain U.S. state governments and other stakeholders, could damage our reputation with investors, clients, employees and regulators.  In addition, the transition to a low-carbon economy could give rise to the need for innovative insurance, reinsurance and risk management solutions for entirely new industries and companies, as well as advice and services to bolster climate resilience for existing companies.  If we fail to innovate and provide valuable services to our clients in response to these changes, we could lose market share to our competitors or new market entrants that do.  We do not generally assume net underwriting risk, other than with respect to de minimis amounts necessary to provide minimum or regulatory capital, and briefly, in connection with our catastrophe bond business, and thus do not generally experience direct material financial implications related to extreme weather events.  In addition, we are a professional services firm with people as our most important asset and limited physical operations.  However, in cases where underwriting enterprises fail or face significant payouts related to extreme weather events leading them to withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage, as observed in places such as California, Louisiana, and Florida, such withdrawal negatively impacts the overall capacity for risk-taking capital.  If this reduction is substantial, it could limit our ability to secure certain lines of coverage for our clients, ultimately reducing our revenues and profitability.  Underwriting enterprises are also clients of Gallagher Re, so any of the negative developments for underwriting enterprises referred to above could also reduce our commission revenues from such clients.  Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks  Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information and cybersecurity attacks or other security breach of our information systems, or those of third-party vendors we rely on, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation. We collect, use, store, transmit and otherwise process, confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, acquisition targets, our employees and our clients.  This information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, financial information and intellectual property. We maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information.  Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error, malfeasance or highly sophisticated cyber-attacks, which are heightened as a result of the war in Ukraine and in the Middle East or other cybersecurity incidents.  It is possible that our security controls, employee training and other aspects of our cybersecurity safeguards are not effective.  See “The substantial increase in remote work among our employees subjects us to certain challenges and risks” above for a discussion of how remote work enhances these risks. We have and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, policies, resources and employee training.  The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing appropriate technical measures is high.  Given the continuously evolving cyber threat landscape, it will become increasingly difficult to detect, defend against and remediate cybersecurity incidents and data breaches.  If we are unable to effectively maintain and enhance our system safeguards in line with evolving cyber threats, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs, including litigation costs, regulatory enforcement action, loss of clients, reputational damage, and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.  We rely on IT and third party vendors to support our business activities, including our secure processing of personal, confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information.  Despite ongoing efforts to improve our and our vendors’ ability to protect and defend against cyber-attacks, we may not be able to protect all of our data.  Cybersecurity incidents and data breaches of certain systems on which we rely have occurred, such as the ransomware incident that occurred in 2020 (as disclosed in previous filings), and we also have from time to time experienced other cybersecurity incidents such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, and privacy incidents, such as loss or inadvertent transmission of data, although to date we have not been materially impacted by such events.  In the future, breaches of any third-party or internal systems may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service, hacking, “phishing”, 22 computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other cyber-attacks, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions.  Furthermore, the risk from threat actors has increased due to the rapid development of AI capabilities. We are an acquisitive organization.  The process of integrating information systems of businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems or information handling, privacy and security policies and protocols, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems and data more vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents.  Any future, material cybersecurity or data incident, may cause us to experience unauthorized access, exfiltration, manipulation, corruption, loss or disclosure of our proprietary, client, employee, or other data, reputational harm, the inability to render services due to system outages or other business disruptions, loss of clients and revenue, regulatory action and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information, increases in cybersecurity costs or financial losses.  Any of the foregoing may be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cybersecurity incident or the full extent of such incident.  In addition, disclosure or media reports of actual or perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third-party service providers, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could lead to reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, or increased regulatory actions oversight and scrutiny.  Such incidents could result in confidential, personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen, used to perpetuate fraud, maliciously made public, surreptitiously modified, or rendered inaccessible for a period of time.  We cannot ensure that any limitations of liability provisions in our agreements with clients, vendors and other third parties with which we do business would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liability with respect to claims arising from a cybersecurity, data or similar incident. As we experienced in connection with the 2020 ransomware incident referred to above, during a cybersecurity incident, we might have to take our systems offline, which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation.  While we endeavor to design and implement technologies, policies and procedures to identify such incidents as quickly as possible, any response would take substantial time, and there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information.  During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all of which may further increase the costs and consequences of such incident.  Any of these losses may not be insured against or be fully covered by insurance we maintain. In addition, the competition for talent is high in the cybersecurity and privacy space, and we may not be able to hire, develop or retain suitable talent that we need to be capable of minimizing, identifying, mitigating or remediating these risks. With respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors, we have processes designed to require third party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to their storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information.  However, we remain at risk of a cyber or data incident due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendor’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor’s processes, or a cybersecurity incident involving vendor’s information systems.  We cannot ensure that any provisions in our agreements with these vendors would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liability in connection with these incidents. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation. We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results. We are or have been subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.  Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or provide clients with appropriate consulting, advisory, pension and claims handling services.  There is the risk that our employees or sub-agents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis.  Certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advisory or decision-making services to clients.  Additionally, Gallagher Re operates a securities business.  If our clients experience investment losses, our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business.  Where appropriate, we have established provisions against these matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments.  The damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or other extraordinary damages.  It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings 23 were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results.  In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure.  We have purchased E&O insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters.  Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable.  These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant. As more fully described in Note 17 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements, we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business, including but not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action.  We are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business.  For example, our micro-captive advisory services business has been under investigation by the IRS since 2013.  We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  However, legal proceedings and government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other adverse events could occur, including the payment of substantial monetary damages or an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial position.  In addition, regardless of any unfavorable ruling, any such matter could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, destruction, and security of personal data.  These laws apply to transfers of personal information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors and clients.  Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws evolve and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state, and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.  Some of these laws provide rights to individuals to access, correct, and delete their personal information and to obtain copies at the expense of the business entities that process their data.  Some of these laws carry heavy penalties for violations, e.g., fines of up to 4% of worldwide revenue under the U.K. Data Protection Act and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and up to $7,500 per intentional violation under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).  In the U.S., there is pending federal legislation and a number of states have proposed their own comprehensive data privacy bills similar to the GDPR and CCPA, with some of those laws already in effect, and others coming into effect between 2024 and 2026. India and other countries where we have operations outside the U.S. have proposed or have enacted sweeping data protection laws, and in some cases we are subject to sector and personal data localization laws that may require that data or personal data stay within their borders, such as India's IRDIA (Maintenance of Insurance Records) Regulation, 2015. In addition, in the U.S., legislators are continuing to enact comprehensive cybersecurity laws.  For example, we are subject to the New York State Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulation for Financial Services Companies, which were substantively amended in 2023.  We also expect to be subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing AI, such as the proposed EU AI Act which is expected to be enacted in 2024.  These laws and regulations are still evolving, and while we are assessing how regulators may apply existing consumer protection, data protection and other similar laws to AI, there is uncertainty regarding the scope of new laws and how existing laws will apply.  Due to this uncertainty, we may face challenges complying with existing and new laws, and our policies and governance frameworks may not be successful in mitigating these risks.  See also “We are subject to risks associated with AI.”  Adhering to the increased obligations imposed by various new and emerging laws causes us to incur substantial expenses in connection with developing, implementing, and securing our systems and effectively implementing data privacy governance policies for the lawful processing of personal data.  Such increased obligations also result in the allocation of additional resources towards new privacy compliance processes and enhanced technologies, further contributing to our IT and compliance costs.  In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase.  The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations 24 could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws, sanctions laws and FATCA. In countries outside the U.S., a risk exists that our employees or third parties acting on our behalf, including correspondent brokers, consultants, introducers, partners or agents, could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and sanctions laws such as those administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.  Anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls.  Trade and financial sanctions laws generally restrict the ability to engage in trade with, or provide goods or services, to designated governments or other parties, or may require freezing of such parties’ assets.  We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption.  In such parts of the world, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.  Similarly, some of these countries do not implement sanctions laws and may not restrict trade with parties designated as sanctions targets under U.S., U.K. or EU laws. Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs designed to ensure compliance, including investigating business practices and taking steps to address the risk that our employees, third party representatives, partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and/or such laws and regulations. We offer client service capabilities in many countries around the world through a network of third-party representatives acting on our behalf such as correspondent brokers and consultants.  In certain limited instances, we also work with third-party introducers that provide services for certain clients.  There is a risk that our third party representatives engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies or violate applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act.  As previously disclosed, during 2022, we received a subpoena from the FCPA Unit of the DOJ seeking information related to our insurance business with public entities in Ecuador.  During the fourth quarter of 2023, the DOJ informed us that it has closed its inquiry and would not be pursuing enforcement action against us. Violations by us or our third party representatives could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm. We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate trade sanctions laws of the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions in which we operate.  In addition, FATCA requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees and our failure to do so properly could result in penalties. We are subject to regulation worldwide.  If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable. Many of our activities throughout the world, especially regulated businesses such as our insurance brokerage, securities broker-dealer and investment advisory services, are subject to supervision and regulations promulgated by regulatory or self-regulatory bodies such as the SEC, the NYSE, the DOJ, the IRS, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the FTC and FINRA in the U.S., the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate.  Our retirement-related consulting and investment advisory services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries.  Our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing licensing, data privacy, AI, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, competition, anti-corruption, currency, the conduct of business, reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries.  For example, the DOJ revised its Corporate Criminal Enforcement Policies and Practices to include a section on the use of personal devices and third-party messaging applications, indicating that their use poses significant risk to companies and suggesting that it intends to investigate seriously whether companies have ensured that data from these sources is preserved for investigations; additionally, the FTC proposed a rule that would prevent employers from entering into non-competes with employees and require employers to rescind existing non-competes.  These and other forms of regulatory action could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, increasing the risk of costly enforcement actions, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, underwriting 25 enterprises and third parties.  As our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization.  A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to a loss of reputation in the local market, and litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties, and/or the loss of our authorization to operate.  In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees. The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including increased staffing needs, the development of new policies, procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations, adding to our cost of doing business.  Many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance.  In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business, that we are operating our business in a compliant manner, or that our rights are otherwise protected.  In addition, major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges.  For example, China adopted a “blocking” statute similar to that of the EU requiring compliance with certain Chinese laws if they conflict with U.S. laws.  Rising global tensions and protectionism may also lead other countries to adopt similar blocking statutes, which could make it more difficult and costly for us to expand our operations globally. Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, or the failure of state and local governments to follow through on agreed-upon state and local tax credits or other tax related incentives, could adversely affect our results of operations or require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest.  The potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions.  The vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance and reinsurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees.  We receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises, separate from retail commissions and fees, including, among other things, contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them.  Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these revenues.  Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients, underwriting enterprises or other business partners. In addition, as regulators and investors increasingly focus on climate change and other sustainability issues, we are exposed to the risk of frameworks and regulations being adopted that require significant effort to comply with and which are ill-adapted to our operations.  For example, pursuant to the CSRD, in 2023 the first set of EU sustainability reporting standards (which we refer to as ESRS) has been developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (which we refer to as EFRAG) and adopted by the EU.  EFRAG will continue to issue sector-specific and non-EU applicable ESRS in the coming years, with such standards to be tailored to EU policy positions which may be different or contradictory with those applicable to our business in other jurisdictions.  The CSRD is expected to entail substantial disclosure obligations in future years for us and some of our EU subsidiaries.  The SEC has also proposed new climate change disclosure requirements, which are expected to become effective in 2024.  Additionally, the state of California has enacted disclosure rules similar to the SEC rules, which will become effective between 2024 and 2026.  Furthermore, in the U.K., our business is subject to a number of disclosure obligations under different sustainability frameworks, such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures framework; Australia is planning to enact mandatory disclosures based on the International Sustainability Standards Board standards (which we refer to as ISSB) in 2024; and other jurisdictions, such as Canada and Brazil, have also announced that they plan to implement ISSB-based disclosures.  Compliance with such rules and frameworks will require significant effort and could divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.  Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP).  These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements.  We are also required to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the disclosed and recorded amounts of revenues and expenses related to revenue recognition and deferred costs - see Note 4 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements.  We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments, income taxes, revenue recognition, deferred costs, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we 26 believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances.  Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.  Further, in August 2022, the U.S. enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act (which we refer to as the IRA) which, among other things, implements a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on stock buy backs beginning for years after 2022.  While guidance is still being issued, our current understanding of these new rules suggests that we will not face significant impacts from these changes.  As additional guidance relating to the IRA is released, our estimates related to the IRA may change.  Additionally, changes in accounting standards (see Note 2 to our 2023 consolidated financial statements) could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations. Limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and our ability to compete effectively, and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We cannot guarantee that trade secret, trademark and copyright law protections, or our internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property, are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property.  Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights.  Also, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We cannot be sure that our services and products, or the products of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients.  These claims may harm our reputation, result in financial liability, consume financial resources to pursue or defend, and prevent us from offering some services or products.  In addition, these claims, whether with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s focus and resources from business operations.  Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common Stock Our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We generated tax credits under IRC Section 45 from 2009 to 2021.  As of December 31, 2023, we had generated a total of $1,706.1 million in IRC Section 45 tax credits, of which approximately $891.4 million have been used to offset U.S. federal tax liabilities and $814.7 million remain unused and available to offset future U.S. federal tax liabilities. Our ability to use tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon the operations in which we invested having satisfied the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.  These include, among others, the “placed-in-service” condition and requirements relating to qualified emissions reductions, coal sales to unrelated parties and at least one of the operations’ owners qualifying as a “producer” of refined coal.  While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations did not satisfy the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.  The ongoing implementation of Pillar 2 in the U.S. and around the world could also negatively impact our ability to use these tax credits in the timeframe and manner that would be beneficial to us.  Similarly, the law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits (related to our prior synthetic coal operations) expired on December 31, 2007.  At December 31, 2023, we had exposure with respect to $108.0 million of previously earned tax credits under IRC Section 29.  We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years was in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29 related limited liability companies in which we had an interest.  We understand these private letter rulings were consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and we have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them.  In addition, the IRS audited certain of the IRC Section 29 facilities without requiring any changes. While none of our prior IRC Section 29 operations are currently under audit, two of the IRC Section 45 operations in which we are invested are under audit by the IRS, and it has taken the position that certain losses and tax credits should be disallowed.  We are defending this matter vigorously.  Additionally, one of these partnerships received a notice from the IRS disallowing our co-investors from claiming tax credits.  The partnership defended its position in tax court and prevailed in August 2019.  The decision was affirmed by the D.C. Court of Appeals.  The IRS could place the remaining IRC Section 45 operations and any of the prior IRC Section 29 operations under audit.  An adverse outcome with respect to our ability to claim tax credits under any such audit would likely cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in IRC Section 29 tax credits. There is a risk that foreign laws will not protect the intellectual property associated with The Chem-Mod Solution to the same extent as U.S. laws, leaving us vulnerable to companies outside the U.S. who may attempt to copy such intellectual property.  In addition, other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod Solution. 27 For example, in July 2019, Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and MES Inc. (which we refer to together, as Midwest Energy) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against us, Chem Mod LLC and numerous other related and unrelated parties.  The complaint alleged that the named defendants infringed patents held exclusively by Midwest Energy and sought unspecified damages and injunctive relief.  In 2023, we settled this matter for an amount that was not material and without admitting any wrongdoing.  However, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of any future claims against us by other parties. The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations were subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety.  Some environmental laws, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, impose liability on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise responsible for, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment.  One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties.  By having used The Chem‑Mod Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of  being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating.  Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod Solution.  Increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of regulatory attention and private litigation.  For example, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a public nuisance.  In addition to the possibility of our being named in such actions, we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod Solution.  No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to provide for assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators, or other end users, will result in that facility owner or operator, or other end user, accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim.  Nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators, or other end users, fully complied with all applicable laws and regulations, and this could result in environmental or product liability claims.  It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, nuisance, diminution of property value, or similar claims.  Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim, and defense of such claims can be costly, even when such defense prevails.  If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. As of December 31, 2023, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $8.0 billion.  The level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility.  We also bear risk at the time our debt matures.  Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations.  This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates.  A small portion of our private placement debt consists of floating rate notes, and interest payments under our senior revolving credit facility are based on a floating rate which exposes us to the risk of a changing or unknown rate environment.  Our indebtedness will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and general corporate purposes.  If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business.  Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The agreements governing our debt include covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments, and require us to comply with certain financial and legal covenants.  The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.  We may also incur future debt obligations 28 that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends.  We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  A failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.  The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Our reinsurance securities business serves from time to time as the underwriter and initial purchaser of securities (such as catastrophe bonds) issued by our reinsurance company clients.  This involves us, acting as an intermediary, to use our capital on hand and short-term borrowings to cover the purchase price of the securities.  We place the securities with investors and use the funds we receive from them to repay our obligations.  Risks specific to these short-term borrowings include counterparty risk (which is the risk that arises due to uncertainty about a counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations) with respect to the investors.  Non-performance by any of our counterparties in these transactions for financial or other reasons could potentially expose us to material losses. Credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk. If we need to raise capital in the future (for example, in order to maintain adequate liquidity, fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives), credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs, and could limit our access to financing sources.  We would also face the risk of a credit rating downgrade if we do not retire or refinance the debt to levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies in a timely manner.  Further, a downgrade to a rating below investment-grade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures. We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries. We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries.  As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses.  In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations, pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, we derive a meaningful portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S.  Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. in the event we are unable to meet these U.S. based cash requirements. Funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. may be repatriated to the U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings, where necessary.  A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner. In the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations, including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock, could be adversely affected. Future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. An important way we grow our business is through acquisitions.  One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities.  The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock.  Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, performance stock units, options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest, our stockholders will experience further dilution.  In November 2022, we established an ""at the market"" equity offering program (which we refer to as an ATM program) pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to 3,000,000 shares of our common stock.  We have refreshed our ATM program in the past and expect to refresh our ATM program periodically.  Sales under our ATM 29 program will result in additional dilution for our stockholders.  Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders.  The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur"

Global economic events and other factors, such as accommodative monetary and fiscal policy and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, have contributed to significant inflation in many of the markets in which we operate.  In order to combat inflation and restore price stability, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates and has signaled further increases to interest rates in 2023.  Increased inflation and interest rates may hinder economic growth in the U.S. and could have far reaching effects on the global economy.  Furthermore, as central banks worldwide simultaneously raise interest rates to combat inflation, economic growth may also deteriorate in Europe, China and other geographies. A recession or decline in economic activity for these and any other reasons (including repercussions from the war in Ukraine, climate change, the transition to a low-carbon economy, or uncertainty caused by a political crisis over the debt ceiling in the U.S. or political 12 violence and chaos around the world), could adversely impact us in future periods as a result of reductions in the amount of insurance coverage, reinsurance coverage, consulting services or claims administration services that our clients purchase due to reductions in headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors.  Any such reduction or decline (whether caused by an overall economic decline or declines in certain industries or in certain countries and regions in which we operate) could adversely impact our commission and fee revenues, consulting revenues or revenues from managing third-party insurance claims.  Some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected. Moreover, U.S. and global economic conditions have created market uncertainty and volatility.  Such general economic conditions, such as inflation, stagflation, political volatility, rising cost of labor, cost of capital, interest rates and tax rates, affect our operating and general and administrative expenses, and we have no control or limited ability to control such factors.  If our costs grow significantly, our margins and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives.  Further, a slowdown in the global economy, including a recession, or in a particular region or industry, inflation or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity, including our ability to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when needed and under similar terms, which may increase our borrowing costs.  In addition, we could experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other counterparties.  Thus, a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and globally could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risk-taking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of receivables from certain of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance.  If those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  The failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients.  Further, the failure of errors and omissions underwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable.  Underwriting enterprises are also clients of our reinsurance brokerage operations, so any of the negative developments for underwriting enterprises referred to above could also reduce our commission revenues from such clients.  Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, if underwriting enterprises merge or if a large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage, for example, because of large payouts related to climate change or other emerging risk areas, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and reduce demand from the insurance company clients of our reinsurance operations and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability. Business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations, damage our reputation and impact client relationships. Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business.  Such a disruption could be caused by a cybersecurity incident (for example, as disclosed in previous filings, we experienced a ransomware attack in 2020), human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, natural disasters, pandemics, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, civil disruption, political violence and unrest in the U.S. or elsewhere around the world, or war.  Our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us.  For example, we have substantial operations in India that provide important client support and other back-office services for our global organization.  To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, rising tensions between India and China, incidents of terrorism in India, the potential for civil unrest and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India.  However, such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future.  Should our access to these services be disrupted, our client relationships could be harmed, our liability for errors and omissions could increase, and our reputation could be damaged, causing our business, operating results and financial condition to be adversely affected.We face risks relating to our acquisition of Willis Re. Upon completion of  the Willis Re acquisition on December 1, 2021, we paid Willis Towers Watson plc an initial gross purchase price of $3.17 billion.  Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the purchase price is subject to potential additional deferred consideration of up to $750 million, payable in 2025 based on revenues of the acquired operations in 2024.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the reinsurance operations acquired from Willis Towers Watson plc, that the acquired operations will perform as expected, or that we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities.  Integration efforts relating 13 to the Willis Re acquisition are complex, including with respect to technology and IT systems, which may divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we have made certain assumptions relating to the Willis Re acquisition, which assumptions may be inaccurate, including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the Willis Re acquisition, higher than expected integration costs and unknown liabilities as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition of Willis Re.  These assumptions relate to various matters, including: projections of future expenses and expense allocation relating to the Willis Re acquisition and the acquired assets; our ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with employees, including key brokers, and customers associated with the acquired assets; the amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from the acquisition of the Willis Re acquisition; and other financial and strategic risks of the Willis Re acquisition.We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefit consulting firms and, to a lesser extent, third party claims administration and risk management firms.  We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.Our ordinary-course acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth, particularly in our brokerage segment, and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future.  See also the risk factor relating to the Willis Re acquisition above.  Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth.  Continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms, private equity-backed consolidators and newly public insurance brokers has in some cases made and could in the future make appropriate acquisition targets more difficult to identify and more expensive.  Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions, be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions.  When regulatory approval of acquisitions is required, our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator.  Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of larger acquisitions than we have historically.  See Note 3 to our 2022 consolidated financial statements for information regarding the size of transactions in the reporting period.Post-acquisition risks include poor cultural fit and risks relating to retention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar or complex markets or lines of business, contingencies or liabilities, such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accounting issues, the risk that an acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business, and integration difficulties relating to accounting, information technology, pay equity, human resources, or employee attrition, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth.  The failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges. Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reputation is one of our key assets.  We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our expertise, level of service, ability to protect client information, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities such as ethics, culture and values.  Our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential employees, investors, regulators and the communities in which we operate.  Negative perceptions or publicity regarding the matters noted above, including our association with clients or business partners with damaged reputations, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees, could damage our reputation.  Our reputation could also be harmed by negative perceptions or publicity regarding ESG, including concerns with environmental matters, climate change, workforce diversity, political spending, pay equity, harassment, racial justice, cybersecurity and data privacy, as well as backlash against ESG initiatives generally.  Any resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain clients, employees or investors; result in lower ESG ratings, exclusion of our stock from ESG-oriented indices, and reduced demand for our stock from ESG-focused investment funds; increase our cost of borrowing; or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate.  Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  See below for additional risk factors regarding climate risks and ESG initiatives and disclosures.Our ESG-related aspirations, goals and initiatives, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks.Our business may face increased scrutiny from the investment community, clients, employees, other stakeholders, potential acquisition targets, regulators and the media related to our ESG activities, including our goal to reach Net Zero carbon emissions in our direct operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2050, other goals, targets and objectives we may announce in the future, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them.  If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, 14 business partner or as an acquiror could be negatively impacted.  Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental or other standards, regulations or expectations or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, could have the same negative impacts, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. If we are unable to apply technology and data analytics effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption, “big data” and data analytics, and other developments in technology.  These may include new applications or insurance-related services based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, blockchain, the metaverse or new approaches to data mining that impact the nature of how we generate revenue.  We may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants (for example, through disintermediation or use of the metaverse) or new entrants such as technology companies, “Insurtech” start-up companies and others.  These new entrants are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence and blockchain, in an attempt to simplify and improve the client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate.  We must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards.  We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace.  Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise, make use of data analytics, and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses.  Investments in technology systems and data analytics capabilities may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected, or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs.  If we cannot offer new technologies or data analytics solutions as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, data analytics solutions or other product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs.In some cases, we depend on key third-party vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives.  If these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified talent, including our senior management team.We depend upon members of our senior management team, who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy.  We could be adversely affected if we fail to plan adequately for the succession of these leaders, including our chief executive officer.  We could also be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain talent and foster a diverse and inclusive workplace throughout our organization.  Competition for talent is intense in many areas of our business, particularly in our claims management business, our IT organization and in rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence and data engineering.  In addition, our industry has experienced competition for leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers, along with their clients, business relationships and intellectual property directly to our competition.  We enter into agreements with many of our brokers and significant client-facing employees and all of our executive officers, which prohibit them from disclosing confidential information and/or soliciting our clients, prospects and employees upon their termination of employment.  The confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control, as defined in the agreements.  Although we pursue legal actions for alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action, such legal actions may not be effective in preventing such breaches, theft or infringement.  In certain cases, our competitors have solicited employees in violation of their employment agreements as a matter of standard business practice, apparently determining that the cost of defending litigation is outweighed by the benefits of acquiring our employees in this manner.  In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently proposed a rule that would prevent employers from entering into non-competes with employees and require employers to rescind existing non-competes.  If this rule goes into effect, or if we fail to adequately address any of the issues referred to above, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  See also “The substantial increase in remote work among our employees subjects us to certain challenges and risks” below.Sustained increases in compensation expense and the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability. Compensation expense and the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits, substantially affects our profitability.  In the past, we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including wage inflation, increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates 15 and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities.  Our compensation expense ratio in 2022 as a percent of total revenue was 56% compared to 55% in 2021.  A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets, changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities, or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plan’s liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years.  Although we have actively sought to control increases compensation expense and the cost of employee benefits, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.Our substantial operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S.In 2022, we generated approximately 35% of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the U.S.  Our business outside the U.S. presents operational, economic and other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S.  These include, among others, risks relating to:•Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to labor and employment, data privacy requirements, prohibitions on corrupt payments to government officials, export and import duties, environmental policies, sustainability disclosures, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad.  We are subject to the risk that we, our employees, our agents, or our affiliated entities, or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations or policies, for which we might be held responsible.  Actual or alleged violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.   While we believe that relations with work councils and trade unions in these countries are and will continue to be satisfactory, work stoppages could occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements.  In addition, collective bargaining negotiations may (1) result in significant increases in the cost of labor, (2) divert management’s attention away from operating the business or (3) break down and result in the disruption of operations.  The occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could result in increased costs and impair our ability to operate our business.  These and other international regulatory risks and labor related risks are described below under “Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks”;•We own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as Casanueva Perez S.A.P.I. de C.V. in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full ownership; •The potential costs, difficulties and risks associated with local regulations across the globe, including the risk of personal liability for directors and officers (for example, in the U.K.) and “piercing the corporate veil” risks under the corporate law regimes of certain countries;•Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations.  For example, we are building our Latin American operations through acquisitions of local family-owned insurance brokerage firms.  If we lose a local leader, recruiting a replacement locally or finding an internal candidate qualified to transfer to such location could be difficult;•Less flexible employee relationships, which in certain circumstances has limited our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after they are no longer employed with us or recover damages, and made it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;•Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies.  We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars.  Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations;•Conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business;•Political and economic instability (including risks relating to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine);•Coordinating our communications, policies and logistics across geographic distances, multiple time zones and in different languages, including during times of crisis management;•Risks relating to our post-Brexit plan to address the loss of passporting rights between the U.K. and EU with respect to insurance brokerage services.  Our plan (implemented in September 2020) involved transferring the European Economic Area (EEA) clients of our U.K.-based regulated entities to a Swedish subsidiary authorized in the EEA, and providing some services through a U.K. branch of such subsidiary.  Although this “reverse branch” model is typical of other brokers 16 of a similar size, there can be no assurance that the approach of EU regulators will not change.  We currently await the outcome of an industry-wide consultation initiated by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in July 2022, the outcome of which could potentially require us to adjust our plans in relation to the U.K. branch and cause further management distraction and cost;•Unfavorable audits and exposure to additional liabilities relating to various non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes) in foreign jurisdictions.  In addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, discriminatory or confiscatory taxation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretation and the financial results of our international subsidiaries.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (which we refer to as the OECD) continues to issue reports and recommendations as part of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (which we refer to as BEPS), and in response many countries in which we do business are expected to adopt rules which may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined.  For example, in response to the OECD recommendations for a global minimum tax, the EU has unanimously agreed to modify its domestic laws before the end of 2023 to comply with BEPS Pillar 2, adopting the various elements of a global minimum tax regime.  Other countries such as the U.K. and Canada have made similar announcements during 2022.  In addition, many jurisdictions adopted stimulus measures in response to COVID-19, many of which offered continued employment benefit subsidies, payroll tax deferrals or tax refunds that have various tax impacts for businesses;•Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;•Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs; •New pandemics (in addition to COVID-19) at a regional or global level; •Lost business or other financial harm due to protectionism in the U.S. and in countries around the world, including adverse trade policies, governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency, and governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S.; and •The trade and military policies of the U.S. government could further develop in ways that exacerbate the risks described above, or introduce new risks for our international operations.   If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Changes in tax laws could adversely affect us. We operate in various jurisdictions and are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties, or regulations in those jurisdictions.  A material change in the tax laws, treaties, or regulations, or their interpretation, of any jurisdiction with which we do business, or in which we have significant operations, could adversely affect us.  For example, in October 2021, the OECD announced that 136 countries and tax jurisdictions have agreed to implement a new “Pillar 2” approach to international taxation.  The first detailed draft rules under that approach were published in December 2021.  The U.K. and Canada agreed to adopt these rules in the second half of 2022 and the 27 countries of the EU unanimously agreed to adopt these rules in December 2022.  The new approach is expected to come into effect for the first time in 2023, although different countries will potentially implement the necessary rules in different ways, through their individual agreement to tax treaty changes and through changes to their own domestic tax laws.  Pillar 1 exempts regulated financial institutions and we believe we qualify for such exemption.  Pillar 2 will establish a global minimum tax rate of 15%, such that multinational enterprises with an effective tax rate in a jurisdiction below this minimum rate will need to pay additional tax, which could be collected by the parent company’s tax authorities if that parent country adopts Pillar 2 or by those in other countries, depending on whether and how each country implements the OECD’s approach in its tax treaties and domestic tax legislation.  Depending on how the jurisdictions in which we operate, and those in which we and our subsidiaries are based, choose to implement the OECD’s approach in their tax treaties and domestic tax laws, particularly if the U.S. does not adopt Pillar 2, we could be adversely affected due to our income being taxed at higher effective rates, once these new rules come into force.The COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption.  If more contagious variants of COVID-19 develop and spread in the future, many of the negative impacts of the pandemic could return.  Earlier in the pandemic, the decline in economic activity it caused adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Reductions in our clients’ exposure units (such as headcount, payroll, properties, the market values of their assets, and plant, equipment and other asset utilization levels, among other factors) reduced the amount of insurance coverage and consulting and claims administration services they needed.  In addition, earlier in the pandemic, the number of newly arising workers’ compensation and general liability claims, which directly impact our fee revenues in our risk management operation, declined materially.  Certain of our brokerage industry 17 niches, such as hospitality, transportation, manufacturing and construction, were significantly affected by the economic decline during the pandemic.  If such a decline in economic activity were to return and clients enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and the collectability of our receivables will be adversely affected.  In addition, factors related to the pandemic, including supply chain issues, have contributed to a rise in inflation in the U.S. and around the world that could negatively impact the economy and the capital markets, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.COVID-19 and the volatile regional and global economic and regulatory conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or new strains or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this report, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price.  Further, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. The substantial increase in remote work among our employees subjects us to certain challenges and risks.Many of our employees now work from home on a full- or part-time basis.  Remote work for some of our employees could affect their productivity, including due to a lower level of oversight, distractions, disruptions due to caregiving obligations or slower or unreliable Internet access.  Remote work may also make some employees feel detached from colleagues and the organization.  In some cases, this may make them more vulnerable to solicitations by competing firms.  In addition, our increased reliance on work-from-home technologies and our employees’ more frequent use of personal devices and non-standard business processing may increase the risk of cybersecurity or data breaches from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions. The increased prevalence of remote work among our employees may also subject us to other challenges and risks. For example, our hybrid work environment may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel who prefer a fully remote or fully in-person work environment. Operating our business with both remote and in-person workers, or workers who work on flexible schedules, could have a negative impact on our corporate culture, decrease the ability of our employees to collaborate and communicate effectively, decrease the ability of newer production and support staff to learn client-handling and other key skills informally around the office, decrease innovation and productivity, or negatively affect employee morale. We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.The insurance brokerage, reinsurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage, reinsurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world.  Three of the firms we compete with in the global risk management and brokerage markets have larger revenues than ours.  In addition, many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office.  Our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms.  Over the past decade or more, private equity sponsors have invested heavily in the insurance brokerage and third party claims administration industries, creating new competitors and strengthening existing ones.  Across all of our operations, Insurtech and technology-based start-ups are entering the business.  In most cases, these businesses complement or enhance our offerings, but in some cases, they compete with us.We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render, the personalized attention we provide, the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client, our data and analytics capabilities, and our ability to help our clients manage their overall risk exposure and insurance or reinsurance costs.  Losing business to competitors offering similar services or products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business.Consolidation among our existing competitors could create additional competitive pressure on us as such firms grow their market share, take advantage of strategic and operational synergies and develop lower cost structures.  In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include: •Increased capital-raising by underwriting enterprises, which could result in new risk-taking capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions;•Underwriting enterprises selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;•Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments;18 •Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance (such as a single-payer system being discussed by some in the U.S.) or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products currently offered by underwriting enterprises; •Climate-change regulation in the U.S. and around the world moving us toward a low-carbon economy, which could create new competitive pressures around climate resilience consulting services and innovative insurance solutions; •Continued consolidation in the financial services industry, leading to larger financial services institutions offering a wider variety of services including insurance brokerage and risk management services; •Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services, or new distribution channels for insurance such as payroll firms and professional employer organizations; and•Third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to our clients.  Their presence in the market increases the competitive pressures that we face.New competition as a result of these or other legislative or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services.  We do not determine the premiums on which our commissions are generally based.  Moreover, premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions.  Because of market cycles for insurance and reinsurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time. As underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to agents or brokers.  The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability.  Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to forecast our commission revenues precisely, including whether they will significantly decline.  As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance and reinsurance markets toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance.  While historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities.  Our ability to generate premium‑based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than a percentage of premium.  This could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided.Contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues, and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations.A meaningful portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises.  Contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period, generally in the first or second quarter, based on the growth and/or profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year.  On the other hand, supplemental revenues are paid up front, on an annual or quarterly basis, generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement.  While underwriting enterprises generally maintain supplemental revenues in the current year at a pre-determined rate, that rate can change in future years as described above.  If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability, volume or growth thresholds, as the case may be, or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  In the case of contingent revenues, under revenue recognition accounting standards, this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods. 19 We face a variety of risks in our benefit consulting operations distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage operations. Our benefit consulting operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations.  The portion of our revenue derived from consulting engagements and special project work is more vulnerable to reduction, postponement, cancellation or non-renewal during an economic downturn than traditional insurance brokerage commissions, and we did experience such a reduction earlier in the pandemic.  In the event of a future recession or economic downturn, we could again experience deterioration in these sources of revenue.  A portion of our benefit consulting operation revenue is tied to assets invested by our clients, and when investment returns are adversely affected (as they were generally in 2022) that portion of our revenue is negatively impacted.  Certain areas within our retirement consulting practice may attract a higher level of regulatory scrutiny due to regulators’ historical interest in such matters, including pension-related products and investment advisory and broker-dealer services.  In addition, we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements relating to employer-sponsored healthcare.  New laws or regulations reducing employer-sponsored health insurance, by limiting or eliminating tax-advantaged employer-sponsored benefits or otherwise, could impact clients’ demand for our services.  If we are unable to adapt our services to changes in the legal and regulatory landscape around employer-sponsored benefits, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In December 2022, we announced the acquisition of Buck, which is expected to close in the first half of 2023.  Upon closing, Buck will be the largest acquisition in the history of our benefit consulting operations and will represent a material portion of such operation’s revenue.  As such, the integration of Buck into our existing operations will represent a more significant effort than for our typical acquisitions.  Risks related to Buck include the possibility that the acquisition does not close when expected or at all because required regulatory approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including expense synergies, are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or issues arising from, the integration; the possibility that the acquisition may be more expensive to integrate than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; diversion of management's attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; the inability to retain certain key employees of the acquired operations or Gallagher; competitive responses to the acquisition; and risks related to defined benefits administration and enterprise-level software development and sales, new areas for our benefit consulting operations.We face a variety of risks in our third-party claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage and benefit consulting operations.In 2020, 2021 and the beginning of 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a reduction in the number of claims we otherwise would have processed, negatively impacting our third party claims administration operations to a greater degree than the rest of our business.  If a new COVID-19 variant emerges and we return to the conditions of 2020 and 2021, we could experience the same kind of negative impact in the future.  Our third party claims administration operations also face a variety of additional risks distinct from those faced by the rest of our business, including the risks that: •RISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, on which our ability to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services is highly dependent, becomes inoperable for some reason.  In addition, we are increasing our use of cloud storage and cloud computing application services supported, upgraded and maintained by third-party vendors.  A disruption affecting RISX-FACS®, third-party cloud services or any other infrastructure supporting our business, including key customer relationship management software, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cause reputational harm and damage our employee and client relationships;•The favorable trend among both underwriting enterprises and self-insured entities toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline;•Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due to changes in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients, or for other reasons;•Contracting terms will become less favorable or the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments;•We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or regulatory developments (including those relating to security and data privacy) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;20 •Volatility in our case volumes, which are dependent upon a number of factors and difficult to forecast accurately, could impact our revenues;•If we do not control our labor and technology costs (and beginning during the pandemic we have been experiencing wage inflation and difficulty attracting and retaining talent), we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);•We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain clients if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations; and•Underwriting enterprises or certain large self-insured entities may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products, and we could face additional competition from potential new entrants into the global claims management services market.If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Climate risks, including the risk of an economic crisis, risks associated with the physical effects of climate change and disruptions caused by the transition to a low-carbon economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Climate change has been widely identified by investors and regulators as a systemic risk to the global economy.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has warned that a gradual change in investor sentiment regarding climate risk introduces the possibility of abrupt tipping points or significant swings in sentiment, which could create unpredictable follow-on effects in financial markets.  If this occurred, not only would our business be negatively impacted by the general economic decline, but a drop in the stock market affecting our stock price could negatively impact our ability to grow through mergers and acquisitions financed using our common stock.The transition to a low-carbon economy could harm specific industries or sectors such as oil and gas in ways that could impact our business.  Our clients in such industries could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurance-related or consulting services, which could adversely impact our commission revenues, consulting revenues or revenues from managing third-party insurance claims. Negative publicity arising from our association with clients in disfavored businesses or industries, or the perception that we are not sufficiently focused on climate risks facing Gallagher or on reducing our own carbon emissions, could damage our reputation with investors, clients, employees and regulators.  In addition, the transition to a low-carbon economy could give rise to the need for innovative insurance and risk management solutions for entirely new industries and companies, as well as advice and services to bolster climate resilience for existing companies.  If we fail to innovate and provide valuable services to our clients in response to these changes, we could lose market share to our competitors or new market entrants that do.We do not generally assume net underwriting risk, other than with respect to de minimis amounts necessary to provide minimum or regulatory capital, and briefly, in connection with our catastrophe bond business, and thus do not generally experience direct material financial implications related to extreme weather events.  In addition, we are a professional services firm with people as our most important asset and limited physical operations.  However, if underwriting enterprises fail or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage because of large payouts related to climate change, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.  Underwriting enterprises are also clients of our reinsurance brokerage operations, so any of the negative developments for underwriting enterprises referred to above could also reduce our commission revenues from such clients.Regulatory, Legal and Accounting RisksImproper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information and cybersecurity attacks could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation. We collect, use, store, transmit and otherwise process, confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, acquisition targets, our employees and our clients.  This information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, financial information and intellectual property. We maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error, malfeasance or highly sophisticated cyber-attacks. It is possible that our security controls and employee training are not effective.  See “The substantial increase in remote work among our employees subjects us to certain challenges and risks” above for a discussion of how remote work enhances these risks.We have and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, policies, resources and employee training.  The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing appropriate technical measures is high.  Given the continuously evolving cyber threat landscape, it will become increasingly difficult to detect, defend against and remediate cybersecurity incidents and data 21 breaches.  If we are unable to effectively maintain and enhance our system safeguards in line with evolving cyber threats, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs, regulatory enforcement action, loss of clients, reputational damage and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.We rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities, including our secure processing of personal, confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information.  Despite ongoing efforts to improve our and our vendors’ ability to protect and defend against cyber-attacks, we may not be able to protect all of our data.  Cybersecurity incidents and data breaches of certain systems on which we rely have occurred, although to date we have not been materially impacted by such events.  In the future, breaches of any third-party or internal systems may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service, hacking, “phishing”, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other cyber-attacks, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions. We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, and privacy incidents, such as loss or inadvertent transmission of data, which to date have not had a material impact on our business.  For example, we have previously disclosed a ransomware incident that occurred in 2020. We are an acquisitive organization.  The process of integrating information systems of businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems or information handling, privacy and security policies and protocols, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems and data more vulnerable to attack. Any future, material cybersecurity or data incident, or media report of the same, even if untrue, may cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of clients and revenue, loss of proprietary data, regulatory action and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses.  Such incidents could result in confidential, personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen, used to perpetuate fraud, maliciously made public, surreptitiously modified, or rendered inaccessible for a period of time.  As we experienced in connection with the 2020 ransomware incident referred to above, during a cyber-attack we might have to take our systems offline, which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation.  Such losses may not be insured against or be fully covered by insurance we maintain. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation.In addition, the competition for talent is high in the cybersecurity and privacy space, and we may not be able to hire, develop or retain suitable talent we need to be capable of identifying, mitigating or remediating these risks.With respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors, we have processes designed to require third party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to their storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information.  However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendor’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes, or a cyber‑attack on a vendor’s information systems. Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results.We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data.  These laws apply to transfers of personal information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors and clients.  Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws evolve and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country, and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.  Some of these laws provide rights to individuals to access, correct, and delete their personal information and to obtain copies at the expense of the business entities that process their data.  Some of these laws carry heavy penalties for violations, e.g., fines of up to 4% of worldwide revenue under the U.K. Data Protection Act and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and up to $7,500 per intentional violation under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).  In the U.S., there is pending federal legislation and several states have proposed their own comprehensive data privacy bills similar to the GDPR and CCPA. India and other countries where we have operations outside the U.S. have proposed sweeping new data protection laws, in some cases including data localization laws that may require that personal data stay within their borders.In addition, in the U.S., legislators are continuing to enact comprehensive cybersecurity laws.  For example, we are subject to the New York State Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulation for Financial Services Companies. 22 Complying with enhanced obligations imposed by various new and emerging laws results in significant costs for developing, implementing and securing our servers lawfully processing personal data and requires we allocate more resources to new privacy compliance processes and to improved technologies, adding to our IT and compliance costs.  In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase.  The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws, sanctioned parties restrictions and FATCA.In countries outside the U.S., a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act.  Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls.  We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption.  In such parts of the world, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws. Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance, including investigating business practices and taking steps to address the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and/or such laws and regulations.  We offer client service capabilities in many countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants.  In certain limited instances, we also work with third-party introducers that provide services for public sector or other clients.  There is a risk that our correspondent brokers and consultants or introducers engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies or violate applicable laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act.  Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm.  As previously disclosed, during 2022, we received a subpoena from the FCPA Unit of the DOJ seeking information related to our insurance business with public entities in Ecuador.  We continue to fully cooperate with the investigation. We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate trade sanctions laws of the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions in which we operate.  In addition, FATCA requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees and our failure to do so properly could result in penalties. We are subject to regulation worldwide.   If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable.Many of our activities throughout the world are subject to supervision and regulations promulgated by regulatory or self-regulatory bodies such as the SEC, the NYSE, the DOJ, the IRS, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the FTC and the FINRA in the U.S., the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate.  Our retirement-related consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries.  Our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing licensing, data privacy, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, the conduct of business, reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries.  For example, the DOJ recently revised its Corporate Criminal Enforcement Policies and Practices to include a section on the use of personal devices and third-party messaging applications, indicating that their use poses significant risk to companies and suggesting that it intends to investigate seriously whether companies have ensured that data from these sources is preserved for investigations.  This and other forms of regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, increasing the risk of costly enforcement actions, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, underwriting enterprises and third parties.  As our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization.  A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties, and/or the loss of our authorization to operate.  In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including increased staffing needs, the development of new policies, procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations, adding to our cost of doing business.  Many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance.  In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less 23 developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business, that we are operating our business in a compliant manner, or that our rights are otherwise protected.  In addition, major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges.  For example, China adopted a “blocking” statute similar to that of the EU requiring compliance with certain Chinese laws if they conflict with U.S. laws.  In 2022, we acquired Willis Re’s reinsurance operations in China.  Rising global tensions and protectionism may also lead other countries to adopt similar blocking statutes, which could make it more difficult and costly for us to expand our operations globally. Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, or the failure of state and local governments to follow through on agreed-upon state and local tax credits or other tax related incentives, could adversely affect our results of operations or require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest.  The potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions.  The vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance and reinsurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees.  We receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises, separate from retail commissions and fees, including, among other things, contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them.  Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts.  Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients, underwriting enterprises or other business partners.In addition, as regulators and investors increasingly focus on climate change and other sustainability issues, we are exposed to the risk of frameworks and regulations being adopted that require significant effort to comply with and which are ill-adapted to our operations. For example, the CSRD, which envisages the adoption of EU sustainability reporting standards to be developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, with such standards to be tailored to EU policies building on and contributing to international standardization initiatives, was adopted and entered into force in 2022.  The CSRD applies not only to local operations in the EU, but under certain circumstances, to entire global companies that have EU operations. The CSRD will not apply to our operations in 2023, but we expect to begin assessing our obligations under the CSRD in 2023 as they are expected to be substantial in future years.  The SEC and the state of California have also proposed new climate change disclosure requirements, and compliance with such rules, when they are finalized, could require significant effort and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results. We are or have been subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.  Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or provide clients with appropriate consulting, advisory, pension and claims handling services.  There is the risk that our employees or sub-agents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis.  Certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decision-making services to clients.  Additionally, we acquired a securities business as part of the Willis Re acquisition.  If our clients experience investment losses, our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business.  Where appropriate, we have established provisions against these matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments.  The damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or other extraordinary damages.  It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results.  In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure.  We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters.  Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable.  These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant.As more fully described in Note 17 to our 2022 consolidated financial statements, we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business, including but not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of 24 action.  We are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business.  For example, our micro-captive advisory services business has been under investigation by the IRS since 2013.  In addition, we are defending a lawsuit (along with Chem-Mod LLC and other defendants) asserting infringement of patents held by Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and MES Inc.  Also as previously disclosed, during 2022, we received a subpoena from the FCPA Unit of the DOJ seeking information related to our insurance business with public entities in Ecuador.  We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  However, legal proceedings and government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other adverse events could occur, including the payment of substantial monetary damages or an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial position.  In addition, regardless of any unfavorable ruling, any such matter could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP).  These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements.  We are also required to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the disclosed and recorded amounts of revenues and expenses related to revenue recognition and deferred costs - see Note 4 to our 2022 consolidated financial statements.  We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments, income taxes, revenue recognition, deferred costs, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances.  Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.  Further, in August 2022, the U.S. enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act (which we refer to as the IRA) which, among other things, implements a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on stock buy backs beginning for years after 2022.  While guidance is still being issued, our current understanding of these new rules suggests that we will not face significant impacts from these changes.  As additional guidance relating to the IRA is released, our estimates related to the IRA may change.  Additionally, changes in accounting standards (see Note 2 to our 2022 consolidated financial statements) could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations. Limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and our ability to compete effectively, and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.We cannot guarantee that trade secret, trademark and copyright law protections, or our internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property, are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property.  Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights.  Also, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We cannot be sure that our services and products, or the products of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients.  These claims may harm our reputation, result in financial liability, consume financial resources to pursue or defend, and prevent us from offering some services or products.  In addition, these claims, whether with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s focus and resources from business operations.  Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common StockOur clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We began generating tax credits under IRC Section 45 in 2009.  As of December 31, 2022, we had generated a total of $1,706.1 million in IRC Section 45 tax credits, of which approximately $959.6 million have been used to offset U.S. federal tax liabilities and $746.5 million remain unused and available to offset future U.S. federal tax liabilities.  Our IRC Section 45 investments’ ability to generate additional tax credits expired on December 31, 2021.Our ability to use tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon the operations in which we invested having satisfied the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.  These include, among others, the “placed-in-service” condition and requirements relating to qualified 25 emissions reductions, coal sales to unrelated parties and at least one of the operations’ owners qualifying as a “producer” of refined coal.  While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations did not satisfy the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.  Similarly, the law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits (related to our prior synthetic coal operations) expired on December 31, 2007.  At December 31, 2022, we had exposure with respect to $108.0 million of previously earned tax credits under IRC Section 29.  We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years was in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest.  We understand these private letter rulings were consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and we have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them.  In addition, the IRS audited certain of the IRC Section 29 facilities without requiring any changes.26 While none of our prior IRC Section 29 operations are currently under audit, several of the IRC Section 45 operations in which we are invested are under audit by the IRS.  One of these partnerships received a notice from the IRS disallowing our co-investors from claiming tax credits.  The partnership defended its position in tax court and prevailed in August 2019.  The decision was affirmed by the D.C. Court of Appeals.  The IRS could place the remaining IRC Section 45 operations and any of the prior IRC Section 29 operations under audit.  An adverse outcome with respect to our ability to claim tax credits under any such audit would likely cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in IRC Section 29 tax credits.There is a risk that foreign laws will not protect the intellectual property associated with The Chem-Mod Solution to the same extent as U.S. laws, leaving us vulnerable to companies outside the U.S. who may attempt to copy such intellectual property.  In addition, other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod Solution.  In July 2019, Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and MES Inc. (which we refer to; together, as Midwest Energy) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against us, Chem‑Mod LLC and numerous other related and unrelated parties.  The complaint alleges that the named defendants infringed patents held exclusively by Midwest Energy and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief.  Discovery is complete and the case is scheduled for trial in November 2023.  We continue to defend this matter vigorously.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter and the financial impact to us.  We believe the probability of a material loss is remote.The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations were subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety.  Some environmental laws, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, impose liability on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise responsible for, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment.  One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties.  By having used The Chem‑Mod Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating.  Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod Solution.  Increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of regulatory attention and private litigation.  For example, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a public nuisance.  In addition to the possibility of our being named in such actions, we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod Solution.  No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators, or other end users, will result in that facility owner or operator, or other end user, accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim.  Nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators, or other end users, fully complied with all applicable laws and regulations, and this could result in environmental or product liability claims.  It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, nuisance, diminution of property value, or similar claims.  Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim, and defense of such claims can be costly, even when such defense prevails.  If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $6.1 billion.  The level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility.  We also bear risk at the time our debt matures.  Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations.  This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates.  A small portion of our private placement debt consists of floating rate notes and interest payments under our senior revolving credit facility are based on a floating rate which exposes us to the risk of a changing or unknown rate environment.  Our indebtedness will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and general corporate purposes.  If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and 27 investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business.  Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.The agreements governing our debt include covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments, and require us to comply with certain financial and legal covenants.  The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.  We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends.  We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  A failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.  The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The reinsurance securities business we acquired as part of the Willis Re acquisition serves from time to time as the underwriter and initial purchaser of securities (such as catastrophe bonds) issued by our reinsurance company clients.  This involves us, acting as an intermediary, to use our capital on hand and short-term borrowings to cover the purchase price of the securities.  We place the securities with investors and use the funds we receive from them to repay our obligations.  Risks specific to these short-term borrowings include counterparty risk (which is the risk that arises due to uncertainty about a counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations) with respect to the investors.  Non-performance by any of our counterparties in these transactions for financial or other reasons could potentially expose us to material losses.Credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk.If we need to raise capital in the future (for example, in order to maintain adequate liquidity, fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives), credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs, and could limit our access to financing sources.  We would also face the risk of a credit rating downgrade if we do not retire or refinance the debt to levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies in a timely manner.  Further, a downgrade to a rating below investment-grade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries. We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries.  As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses.  In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations, pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.Further, we derive a meaningful portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S.  Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. in the event we are unable to meet these U.S. based cash requirements. Funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. may be repatriated to the U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings, where necessary.  A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner.In the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations, including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock, could be adversely affected.28 Future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. An important way we grow our business is through acquisitions.  One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities.  The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock.  Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, performance stock units, options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest, our stockholders may experience further dilution.  Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders.  The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur"

Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky.  The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results such as revenues and net earnings), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price.  These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.  In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.Risks Relating to the Acquisition of Willis Towers Watson plc Treaty Reinsurance Brokerage Operations We may encounter integration challenges and the Acquisition may not perform as expected.On December 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the treaty reinsurance brokerage operations of Willis Towers Watson plc (the “Acquisition”).  Upon completion of the Acquisition, we paid Willis Towers Watson plc an initial gross purchase price of $3.25 billion.  Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the purchase price is subject to potential additional deferred consideration of up to $750 million, payable in 2025 based on revenues of the acquired operations in 2024.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations acquired in the Acquisition, that the acquired operations will perform as expected, or that we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities.  It is possible that our experience in running the operations acquired in the Acquisition will require us to adjust our expectations regarding the impact of the acquisition on our operating results.  In particular, the amount of revenue we expect the acquired operations to lose, due to the departure of key employees, the loss of key clients within the acquired operations, or for other reasons, is based upon estimates, assumptions and projections that may turn out to be incorrect.  As a result, actual lost revenue within the acquired operations may be greater than anticipated.  In addition, integration efforts are anticipated to be complex and may divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our operating results. 11 The risk of non-compliance with non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.The Acquisition will introduce us to several new geographic markets, subjecting us to additional non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, which do not currently apply to us.  These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have become more stringent over time, could increase our cost of doing business, and could result in conflicting legal requirements.  These laws and regulations include international labor and employment laws, data privacy requirements, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials.  We will be subject to the risk that we, our employees, our agents, or our affiliated entities, or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations or policies, for which we might be held responsible.  Actual or alleged violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.While we believe that relations with work councils and trade unions in these countries are and will continue to be satisfactory, work stoppages could occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements.  In addition, collective bargaining negotiations may (1) result in significant increases in the cost of labor, (2) divert management’s attention away from operating the business or (3) break down and result in the disruption of operations.  The occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could result in increased costs and impair our ability to operate our business.We have made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition, which may prove to be materially inaccurate.We have made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition, which assumptions may be inaccurate, including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition, higher than expected transaction and integration costs and unknown liabilities as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following the Acquisition. These assumptions relate to numerous matters, including: •Projections of future revenue, EBITDAC and our earnings per share, including assumptions and projections regarding revenue we expect to lose; •Projections of future expenses and expense allocation relating to the Acquisition and the acquired assets; •Our ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with employees, including key brokers, and customers associated with the acquired assets; •The amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from the Acquisition; •Certain other purchase accounting adjustments that we may be required to record in our financial statements in connection with the Acquisition; •Acquisition costs, including restructuring charges and transaction costs; and •Other financial and strategic risks of the Acquisition.There can be no assurance that deferred closings in certain jurisdictions will occur or that we will realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition.There are deferred closings in twelve jurisdictions scheduled for the first and second quarters of 2022, representing approximately $180 million of the initial purchase consideration.  We can provide no assurance that the various conditions to these deferred closings will be satisfied, including the receipt of regulatory or other necessary approvals, or as to the terms on which any such approvals may be given.  Although we currently anticipate that the Acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share (on an as adjusted earnings basis for expected changes in operating expenses and other items that is not pursuant to GAAP) from and after its closing, this expectation is based on assumptions about our business, the operations to be acquired and preliminary estimates, which may change materially.  As a result, certain other amounts to be paid in connection with the Acquisition may cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.  In addition, a change in the assumptions may result in a change in future earnings, which could be material.12 Risks Relating to our Business GenerallyThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The global spread of COVID-19 (including potentially more contagious strains of COVID-19 such as the Delta and Omicron variants) has created significant volatility and uncertainty and economic disruption.  The extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors, many of which are not within our control and which we may not be able to accurately predict, including: its duration and scope; the ultimate availability, administration and effectiveness of vaccines around the world, and our employees’ and the general population’s willingness to receive them; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, including vaccine mandates, which could be controversial for some employees; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the ability of our clients to pay their insurance premiums which could impact our commission and fee revenues for our services; the nature and extent of claims impacting the ability of underwriting enterprises to pay supplemental and contingent commissions; the number of new arising workers’ compensation and general liability claims; and the long-term impact of employees working from home, including increased technology costs; and employees’ holistic wellbeing. •Economy-related risks.  Earlier in the pandemic, the decline in economic activity caused by COVID-19 adversely affected, and if the economic recovery stalls or reverses could in the future materially adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Reductions in our clients’ exposure units (such as headcount, payroll, properties, the market values of their assets, and plant, equipment and other asset utilization levels, among other factors) will reduce the amount of insurance coverage and consulting and claims administration services they need.  In addition, earlier in the pandemic, the number of newly arising workers’ compensation and general liability claims, which directly impact our fee revenues in our risk management operation, declined materially.  Certain of our brokerage industry niches, such as hospitality, transportation, manufacturing and construction, were significantly affected by the economic decline during the pandemic in 2020.  If such a decline in economic activity were to return and clients enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and the collectability of our receivables will be adversely affected.  In our risk management operation, we inform claimants of insurance coverage and compensability determinations on behalf of our third-party claims administration clients (including, during the past year, with respect to numerous COVID-19 related claims) on the basis of client direction or written opinions from outside counsel.  Claimants who have been denied coverage and sue our clients may also bring actions against us.  While we do not believe any such actions against us generally have merit, they could result in significant costs, damage our reputation, and/or harm our relationships with clients.  In addition, factors related to the pandemic, including supply chain issues, have contributed to a rise in inflation in the U.S. that could negatively impact the economy and the capital markets, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  •Risks related to remote work.  Many of our employees continue to work from home.  Contingency plans related to our service center in India depend upon the normal functioning of our other offices around the world, and until that is the case, we face elevated risk in the event of a crisis rendering the India service center inoperable.  The stresses of remote work for some of our employees may decrease their productivity or make them feel detached from colleagues and the organization.  In some cases, this may make them more vulnerable to solicitations by competing firms.  In addition, our increased reliance on work-from-home technologies and our employees’ more frequent use of personal devices and non-standard business processing may increase the risk of cybersecurity or data breaches from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions.   COVID-19 and the volatile regional and global economic and regulatory conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or new strains or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this report, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price.  Further, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. An economic downturn, as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Apart from the impact of COVID-19, a decline in economic activity for any other reason (including inflation, climate change, the transition to a low-carbon economy, or the uncertainty caused by political violence and chaos), including repercussions from an attack by Russia on Ukraine, could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the amount of insurance coverage and 13 consulting services that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors.  Any such reduction or decline (whether caused by an overall economic decline or declines in certain industries or in certain countries and regions in which we operate) could adversely impact our commission revenues, consulting revenues or revenues from managing third-party insurance claims.  Some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.  Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risk-taking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of receivables from certain of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance.  If those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  The failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients.  Further, the failure of errors and omissions underwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable.  Underwriting enterprises are also clients of our reinsurance brokerage operations, so any of the negative developments for underwriting enterprises referred to above could also reduce our commission revenues from such clients.  Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, if underwriting enterprises merge or if a large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage, for example, because of large payouts related to climate change or other emerging risk areas, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.  We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefit consulting firms and, to a lesser extent, third party claims administration and risk management firms.  We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.Our ordinary-course acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth, particularly in our brokerage segment, and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future.  See also “Risks Relating to Acquisition of Willis Towers Watson plc Treaty reinsurance brokerage operations” above.  Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth.  Continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms, private equity-backed consolidators and newly public insurance brokers (one of which has a partnership tax structure that gives it an advantage in pricing acquisitions) has in some cases made and could in the future make appropriate acquisition targets more difficult to identify and more expensive.  Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions, be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions.  When regulatory approval of acquisitions is required, our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator.  Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of larger acquisitions than we have historically.  See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for information regarding the size of transactions in the reporting period.Post-acquisition risks include poor cultural fit and risks relating to retention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar or complex markets or lines of business, contingencies or liabilities, such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accounting issues, the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business, and integration difficulties relating to accounting, information technology, pay equity, human resources, or employee attrition, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth.  The failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges. We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.The insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world.  Three of the firms we compete with in the global risk management and brokerage markets have larger revenues than ours.  In addition, many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office.  Our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms.  Over the past decade or more, private equity sponsors have invested heavily in the insurance brokerage and third party claims administration industries, creating new competitors and strengthening existing ones.  Across all of our operations, Insurtech and technology-based start-ups are entering the business.  In most cases, these businesses complement or enhance our offerings, but in some cases, they compete with us.14 We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render, the personalized attention we provide, the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client, our data and analytics capabilities, and our ability to help our clients manage their overall risk exposure and insurance or reinsurance costs.  Losing business to competitors offering similar services or products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business.Consolidation among our existing competitors could create additional competitive pressure on us as such firms grow their market share, take advantage of strategic and operational synergies and develop lower cost structures.  In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us.  These developments include:  •Increased capital-raising by underwriting enterprises, which could result in new risk-taking capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions; •Underwriting enterprises selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary; •Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments; •Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance (such as a single-payer system being discussed by some in the U.S.) or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products currently offered by underwriting enterprises;  •Climate-change regulation in the U.S. and around the world moving us toward a low-carbon economy, which could create new competitive pressures around climate resilience consulting services and innovative insurance solutions;  •Continued consolidation in the financial services industry, leading to larger financial services institutions offering a wider variety of services including insurance brokerage and risk management services; and •Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services, or new distribution channels for insurance such as payroll firms and professional employer organizations.New competition as a result of these or other legislative or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services.  We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based.  Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions.  Because of market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers.  The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability.  Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to forecast our commission revenues precisely, including whether they will significantly decline.  As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance.  While historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities.  Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than a percentage of premium.  This could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided.15 Contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues, and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations.A meaningful portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises.  Contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period, generally in the first or second quarter, based on the growth and/or profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year.  On the other hand, supplemental revenues are paid up front, on an annual or quarterly basis, generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement.  While underwriting enterprises generally maintain supplemental revenues in the current year at a pre-determined rate, that rate can change in future years as described above.  If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability, volume or growth thresholds, as the case may be, or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  In the case of contingent revenues, under revenue recognition accounting standards, this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods. If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption and developments in technology.  These may include new applications or insurance-related services based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, blockchain or new approaches to data mining.  We may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants (for example, through disintermediation) or new entrants such as technology companies, “Insurtech” start-up companies and others.  These new entrants are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence and blockchain, to simplify and improve the client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate.  We must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards.  We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace.  Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses.  Investments in technology systems may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected, or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs.  If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs.In some cases, we depend on key third-party vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives.  If these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected.Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reputation is one of our key assets.  We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our expertise, level of service, ability to protect client information, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities such as ethics, culture and values.  Our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential employees, investors, regulators and the communities in which we operate.  Negative perceptions or publicity regarding the matters noted above, including our association with clients or business partners with damaged reputations, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees, could damage our reputation.  Our reputation could also be harmed by negative perceptions or publicity regarding ESG matters including concerns with environmental matters, climate change, workforce diversity, political spending, pay equity, harassment, racial justice, cybersecurity and data privacy.  Any resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain clients, employees or investors; result in lower ESG ratings, exclusion of our stock from ESG-oriented indices, and reduced demand for our stock from ESG-focused investment funds; increase our cost of borrowing in the future; or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate.  Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  See below for additional risk factors regarding climate risks and ESG initiatives and disclosures.16 Climate risks, including the risk of an economic crisis, risks associated with the physical effects of climate change and disruptions caused by the transition to a low-carbon economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Climate change has been widely identified by investors and regulators as a systemic risk to the global economy.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has warned that a gradual change in investor sentiment regarding climate risk introduces the possibility of abrupt tipping points or significant swings in sentiment, which could create unpredictable follow-on effects in financial markets.  If this occurred, not only would our business be negatively impacted by the general economic decline, but a drop in the stock market affecting our stock price could negatively impact our ability to grow through mergers and acquisitions financed using our common stock.The transition to a low-carbon economy could harm specific industries or sectors such as oil and gas in ways that could impact our business.  Our clients in such industries could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurance-related or consulting services, which could adversely impact our commission revenues, consulting revenues or revenues from managing third-party insurance claims. Negative publicity arising from our association with clients in disfavored businesses or industries, or the perception that we are not sufficiently focused on climate risks facing Gallagher or on reducing our own carbon emissions, could damage our reputation with investors, clients, employees and regulators.  In addition, the transition to a low-carbon economy could give rise to the need for innovative insurance and risk management solutions for entirely new industries and companies, as well as advice and services to bolster climate resilience for existing companies.  If we fail to innovate and provide valuable services to our clients in response to these changes, we could lose market share to our competitors or new market entrants that do.We do not assume net underwriting risk, other than with respect to de minimis amounts necessary to provide minimum or regulatory capital, and thus do not experience direct material financial implications related to extreme weather events.  In addition, we are a professional services firm with people as our most important asset and limited physical operations.  However, if underwriting enterprises fail or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage because of large payouts related to climate change, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.  Underwriting enterprises are also clients of our reinsurance brokerage operations, so any of the negative developments for underwriting enterprises referred to above could also reduce our commission revenues from such clients.Our ESG-related aspirations, goals and initiatives, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks.Our business may face increased scrutiny from the investment community, other stakeholders, regulators and the media related to our ESG activities, including goals, targets and objectives we may announce in the future, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them.  If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner or as an acquiror could be negatively impacted.  Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental or other standards, regulations or expectations or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, could have the same negative impacts, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified talent, including our senior management team.We depend upon members of our senior management team, who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy.  We could be adversely affected if we fail to plan adequately for the succession of these leaders, including our chief executive officer.  We could also be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain talent and foster a diverse and inclusive workplace throughout our organization.  Competition for talent is intense in many areas of our business, particularly in rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence and data engineering.  In addition, our industry has experienced competition for leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers, along with their clients, business relationships and intellectual property directly to our competition.  We enter into agreements with many of our brokers and significant client-facing employees and all of our executive officers, which prohibit them from disclosing confidential information and/or soliciting our clients, prospects and employees upon their termination of employment.  The confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control, as defined in the agreements.  Although we pursue legal actions for alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action, such legal actions may not be effective in preventing such breaches, theft or infringement.  Our failure to adequately address any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  See also “Risks related to remote work” in our COVID-19 risk factor above.17 Our substantial operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S.In 2021, we generated approximately 33% of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the U.S.  The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks.  Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations outside the U.S. or create difficulties in staffing and managing such operations.  For example, we have substantial operations in India that provide important services for our global organization.  To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, rising tensions between India and China, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India.  However, such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future.  Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S.  These include, among others, risks relating to: •Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad.  These and other international regulatory risks are described below under “Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks”; •We own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as Casanueva Perez S.A.P. de C.V. in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full ownership;  •The potential costs, difficulties and risks associated with local regulations across the globe, including the risk of personal liability for directors and officers (for example, in the U.K.) and “piercing the corporate veil” risks under the corporate law regimes of certain countries; •Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations.  For example, we are building our Latin American operations (which contributed $58.3 million in revenue from 19 locations in 2021) through acquisitions of local family-owned insurance brokerage firms.  If we lose a local leader, recruiting a replacement locally or finding an internal candidate qualified to transfer to such location could be difficult; •Less flexible employee relationships, which in certain circumstances has limited our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after they are no longer employed with us or recover damages, and made it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment; •Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies.  We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars.  Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations; •Conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business; •Political and economic instability (including risks relating to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war, including a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine); •Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances, multiple time zones and in different languages, including during times of crisis management; •Risks relating to our post-Brexit plan to address the lack of a trade and customs agreement between the U.K. and EU with respect to insurance brokerage services.  Our plan involves transferring our European Economic Area (EEA) clients to a Swedish subsidiary authorized in the EEA, and providing some services through staff working in a U.K. branch of such subsidiary.  Although this “reverse branch” model is typical of other brokers of a similar size, there can be no assurance that the approach of EU regulators will not change, potentially requiring us to adjust our plans in relation to the U.K. branch and causing further management distraction and cost; •Unfavorable audits and exposure to additional liabilities relating to various non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes) in foreign jurisdictions.  In addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, discriminatory or confiscatory taxation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretation and the financial results of our international subsidiaries.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development continues to issue reports and recommendations as part of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (which we refer to as BEPS), and in response many countries in which we do business are expected to adopt rules which may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined.  For example, in response to BEPS, the U.K., Australia and 18  New Zealand adopted rules that affect the deductibility of interest paid on intercompany debt, and other jurisdictions where we operate may do so as well in the near future.  Many jurisdictions adopted stimulus measures in response to COVID-19, many of which offered continued employment benefit subsidies, payroll tax deferrals or tax refunds that have various tax impacts for businesses; •Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices; •Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs;  •New pandemics (in addition to COVID-19) at a regional or global level; and •Lost business or other financial harm due to protectionism in the U.S. and in countries around the world, including adverse trade policies, governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency, and governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S. •The trade and military policies of the U.S. government could further develop in ways that exacerbate the risks described above, or introduce new risks for our international operations.  See also “The risk of non-compliance with non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives,” above, for international risks arising from the Acquisition.  If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We face a variety of risks in our risk management third-party claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage and benefit consulting operations.In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a reduction in the number of claims we otherwise would have processed, negatively impacting our third party claims administration operations to a greater degree than the rest of our business.  In 2021, the number of claims we processed increased, but not to the prepandemic level.  This disproportionate negative impact could continue into 2022.  Our third party claims administration operations also face a variety of additional risks distinct from those faced by the rest of our business, including the risks that:  •The favorable trend among both underwriting enterprises and self-insured entities toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline; •Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due to changes in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients, or for other reasons; •Contracting terms will become less favorable or the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments; •We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or regulatory developments (including those relating to security and data privacy) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable; •Volatility in our case volumes, which are dependent upon a number of factors and difficult to forecast accurately, could impact our revenues; •If we do not control our labor and technology costs (and during the pandemic we have been experiencing wage inflation and difficulty attracting and retaining talent), we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection); •We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain clients if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations; and •Underwriting enterprises or certain large self-insured entities may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products, and we could face additional competition from potential new entrants into the global claims management services market.If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.19 We face a variety of risks in our benefit consulting operations distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage operations. Our benefit consulting operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations.  The portion of our revenue derived from consulting engagements and special project work is more vulnerable to reduction, postponement, cancellation or non-renewal during an economic downturn than traditional insurance brokerage commissions, and we did experience such a reduction for a portion of 2021.  If the economic recovery stalls or reverses in 2022, we could again experience deterioration in these sources of revenue.  Certain areas within our retirement consulting practice may attract a higher level of regulatory scrutiny due to regulators’ historical interest in such matters, including pension-related products and investment advisory and broker-dealer services.  In addition, we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements relating to employer-sponsored healthcare.  New laws or regulations reducing employer-sponsored health insurance could impact clients’ demand for our services.  If we are unable to adapt our services to changes in the legal and regulatory landscape around employer-sponsored healthcare, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability. The cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability.  In the past, we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities.  A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets, changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities, or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years.  Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.Business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations, damage our reputation and impact client relationships. Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business.  Such a disruption could be caused by a cybersecurity incident (for example, as disclosed in previous filings, we experienced a ransomware attack in 2020), human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political violence and unrest in the U.S. or elsewhere around the world, or war.  Our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us.  See our COVID-19 risk factor above.For example, our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of RISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services.  In addition, we are increasing our use of cloud storage and cloud computing application services supported, upgraded and maintained by third-party vendors.  A disruption affecting RISX-FACS®, third-party cloud services or any other infrastructure supporting our business, including key customer relationship management software, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cause reputational harm and damage our employee and client relationships.Regulatory, Legal and Accounting RisksImproper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information and cybersecurity attacks could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation. We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, our employees and our clients.  This information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, financial information and intellectual property. We rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities, including our secure processing of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information.  Cybersecurity or data breaches of certain of the systems on which we rely have occurred, although to date we have not been materially impacted by any such breach.  In the future, breaches of any such third-party or internal system may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions.  20 We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses or unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, and privacy incidents, such as loss or inadvertent transmission of data, which to date have not had a material impact on our business.  For example, we have previously disclosed a ransomware incident that occurred in 2020.    Additionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems or information handling, privacy and security policies and protocols, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems and data more vulnerable to attack.  Our recent acquisition of the Willis Towers Watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations may enhance this risk.  In the future, any material cybersecurity or data incidents, or media reports of the same, even if untrue, could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of clients and revenue, loss of proprietary data, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses.  Such incidents could result in confidential, personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen, used to perpetuate fraud, maliciously made public, surreptitiously modified, or rendered inaccessible for a period of time.  As we experienced in connection with the 2020 ransomware incident referred to above, during a cyber-attack we might have to take our systems offline, which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation.  Such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain.  We maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information.  Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance.  It is possible that our security controls and employee training may not be effective.  See “Risks related to remote work” in our COVID-19 risk factor above for a discussion of how remote work enhances these risks. We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, policies and resources and employee training.  The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase and as technology changes.  As these threats evolve, cybersecurity and data incidents will be more difficult to detect, defend against and remediate.  If we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation.With respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors, we have processes designed to require third party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information.  However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendor’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes, or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems. Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results.We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data.  These laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors.  Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country, which may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.  Some of these laws provide rights to individuals to access, correct, and delete their personal information and to obtain copies at the expense of the business entities that process their data.  Some of these laws carry heavy penalties for violations, e.g., fines of up to 4% of worldwide revenue under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and to $7,500 per intentional violation under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).  In the U.S., there is pending federal legislation and several states have proposed their own comprehensive data privacy bills similar to the GDPR and CCPA.  In addition, in the U.S., legislators are continuing to enact comprehensive cybersecurity laws.  For example, we are subject to the New York State Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulation for Financial Services Companies and CCPA.  India and other countries where we have operations outside the U.S. have also proposed sweeping new data protection laws, in some cases including data localization laws that may require that personal data stay within their borders. 21 Complying with enhanced obligations imposed by various new and emerging laws is resulting in significant costs of developing, implementing or securing our servers and is requiring us to allocate more resources to new privacy compliance processes and to improved technologies, adding to our IT and compliance costs.  In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase.  The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.  We are subject to regulation worldwide.  If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable.Many of our activities throughout the world are subject to supervision and regulations promulgated by regulatory or self-regulatory bodies such as the SEC, the NYSE, the DOJ, the IRS, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Federal Trade Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in the U.S., the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate.  Our retirement-related consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries.  Our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing licensing, data privacy, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries.  This regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, underwriting enterprises and third parties.  As our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization.  A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties, and/or the loss of our authorization to operate.  In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including increased staffing needs, the development of new policies, procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations, adding to our cost of doing business.  Many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance.  In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business, that we are operating our business in a compliant manner, or that our rights are otherwise protected.  In addition, major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges.  For example, China recently adopted a “blocking” statute similar to that of the EU requiring compliance with certain Chinese laws if they conflict with U.S. laws.  In 2022, we expect to have a reinsurance operation in China, following a deferred closing of the acquisition of the Willis Towers Watson plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations in that jurisdiction.  Rising global tensions and protectionism may also lead other countries to adopt similar blocking statutes, which could make it more difficult and costly for us to expand our operations globally.  Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, or the failure of state and local governments to follow through on agreed-upon state and local tax credits or other tax related incentives, could adversely affect our results of operations or require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business.  For example, the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest.  The potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions.  The vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees.  We receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises, separate from retail commissions and fees, including, among other things, contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them.  Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts.  Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients, underwriting enterprises or other business partners.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA, which significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%; limiting the deductibility of interest expense; implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  If the U.S. passes legislation reversing part or all of the TCJA and corresponding regulations, our tax rate could increase. 22 We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws, sanctioned parties restrictions, and FATCA.In countries outside the U.S., a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act.  Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls.  We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption.  In such parts of the world, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws.  In addition, in recent years, two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.S. and the U.K. for improper payments to foreign officials.  These firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements.   Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance, including investigating business practices and taking steps to address the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and/or such laws and regulations.  We use third party partners and agents in certain jurisdictions where it is common industry practice to do so.  Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm.  Although we have not been materially impacted by any such violations, within the past year, we investigated certain business practices that violated our policies and terminated those found to be involved.We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate trade sanctions laws of the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions in which we operate.  In addition, FATCA requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees and our failure to do so properly could result in penalties.  We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results. We are or have been subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.  Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, (including with respect to business interruption or other potential coverage for COVID‑19 losses), report claims on behalf of clients, provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or provide clients with appropriate consulting, advisory, pension and claims handling services.  There is the risk that our employees or sub-agents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis.  Certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decision-making services to clients.  Additionally, our recent acquisition of the Willis Towers Watson plc reinsurance brokerage operations includes a securities business.  If our clients experience investment losses, our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business.  Where appropriate, we have established provisions against these matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments.  The damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or other extraordinary damages.  It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results.  In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure.  We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters.  Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable.  These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant.As more fully described in Note 17 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements, we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business, including but not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action.  We are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business.  For example, our micro-captive advisory services business has been under investigation by the IRS since 2013.  In addition, we are defending a lawsuit (along with Chem-Mod LLC and other defendants) asserting infringement of patents held by Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and MES Inc.  We cannot reasonably predict the outcomes of these or other matters that we may become involved with in the future.  An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period, or on an ongoing basis.  In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, any such matter could expose us to negative publicity, reputational 23 damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.  Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP).  These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements.  We are also required to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the disclosed and recorded amounts of revenues and expenses related to revenue recognition and deferred costs - see Note 4 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements.  We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments, income taxes, revenue recognition, deferred costs, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances.  Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.  Further, as additional guidance relating to the TCJA is released or if the current U.S. president’s administration takes action to reverse portions of the TCJA, our estimates related to the TCJA may change.  Additionally, changes in accounting standards (see Note 2 to our 2021 consolidated financial statements) could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.  See also “We have made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition which may prove to be materially inaccurate” above.Limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and our ability to compete effectively, and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.We cannot guarantee that trade secret, trademark and copyright law protections, or our internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property, are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property.  Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights.  Also, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We cannot be sure that our services and products, or the products of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients.  These claims may harm our reputation, result in financial liability, consume financial resources to pursue or defend, and prevent us from offering some services or products.  In addition, these claims, whether with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s focus and resources from business operations.  Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common StockOur clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We began generating tax credits under IRC Section 45 in 2009.  As of December 31, 2021, we had generated a total of $1,706.1 million in IRC Section 45 tax credits, of which approximately $655.6 million have been used to offset U.S. federal tax liabilities and $1,050.5 million remain unused and available to offset future U.S. federal tax liabilities.  Our IRC Section 45 investments’ ability to generate additional tax credits expired on December 31, 2021.Our ability to use tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon the operations in which we invested having satisfied the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.  These include, among others, the “placed-in-service” condition and requirements relating to qualified emissions reductions, coal sales to unrelated parties and at least one of the operations’ owners qualifying as a “producer” of refined coal.  While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations did not satisfy the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.  Similarly, the law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits (related to our prior synthetic coal operations) expired on December 31, 2007.  At December 31, 2021, we had exposure with respect to $108.0 million of previously earned tax credits under IRC Section 29.  We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years was in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest.  We understand these private letter rulings were consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and we have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them.  In addition, the IRS audited certain of the IRC Section 29 facilities without requiring any changes.24 While none of our prior IRC Section 29 operations are currently under audit, several of the IRC Section 45 operations in which we are invested are under audit by the IRS.  One of these partnerships received a notice from the IRS disallowing our co-investors from claiming tax credits.  The partnership defended its position in tax court and prevailed in August 2019.  The IRS is appealing this ruling.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and accordingly it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or other IRS audits, and their potential impact on us.  The IRS could place the remaining IRC Section 45 operations and any of the prior IRC Section 29 operations under audit.  An adverse outcome with respect to our ability to claim tax credits under any such audit would likely cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in IRC Section 29 tax credits.There is a risk that foreign laws will not protect the intellectual property associated with The Chem-Mod™ Solution to the same extent as U.S. laws, leaving us vulnerable to companies outside the U.S. who may attempt to copy such intellectual property.  In addition, other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod™ Solution.  On July 17, 2019, Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and MES Inc. (together, Midwest Energy) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against us, Chem‑Mod LLC and numerous other related and unrelated parties (some of whom are seeking indemnification from Chem-Mod LLC).  The complaint alleges that the named defendants infringed patents held exclusively by Midwest Energy and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief.  We dispute the allegations contained in the complaint and intend to continue defending this matter vigorously.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and, accordingly it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter.  However, we believe the probability of a material loss is remote.The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations were subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety.  Some environmental laws, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, impose liability on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise responsible for, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment.  One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties.  By having used The Chem‑Mod™ Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating.  Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod™ Solution.  Increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of regulatory attention and private litigation.  For example, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a public nuisance.  In addition to the possibility of our being named in such actions, we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod™ Solution.  No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators, or other end users, will result in that facility owner or operator, or other end user, accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim.  Nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators, or other end users, fully complied with all applicable laws and regulations, and this could result in environmental or product liability claims.  It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, nuisance, diminution of property value, or similar claims.  Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim, and defense of such claims can be costly, even when such defense prevails.  If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $6.3 billion (including $1.6 billion that we added in connection with our acquisition of Willis Towers Watson’s plc treaty reinsurance brokerage operations).  The level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility.  We also bear risk at the time our debt matures.  Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations.  This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates.  A small portion of our private placement debt consists of floating rate notes and interest payments under our senior revolving credit facility are based on a floating rate which exposes us to the risk of a changing or unknown rate environment.  Our indebtedness will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, 25 capital expenditures, share repurchases, and general corporate purposes.  If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business.  Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.The agreements governing our debt include covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments, and require us to comply with certain financial and legal covenants.  The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.  We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends.  We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  A failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.  The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The reinsurance securities business we acquired as part of the Acquisition serves from time to time as the underwriter and initial purchaser of securities (such as catastrophe bonds) issued by our reinsurance company clients.  This involves us, acting as an intermediary, to use our capital on hand and short-term borrowings to cover the purchase price of the securities.  We place the securities with investors and use the funds we receive from them to repay our obligations.  Risks specific to these short-term borrowings include counterparty risk (which is the risk that arises due to uncertainty about a counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations) with respect to the investors.  Non-performance by any of our counterparties in these transactions for financial or other reasons could potentially expose us to material losses.Credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk.If we need to raise capital in the future (for example, in order to maintain adequate liquidity, fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives), credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs, and could limit our access to financing sources.  We would also face the risk of a credit rating downgrade if we do not retire or refinance the debt to levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies in a timely manner.  Further, a downgrade to a rating below investment-grade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures.We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries. We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries.  As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses.  In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations, pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.Further, we derive a meaningful portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S.  Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. in the event we are unable to meet these U.S. based cash requirements. Funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. may be repatriated to the U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings, where necessary.  A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner.26 In the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations, including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock, could be adversely affected.Future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. An important way we grow our business is through acquisitions.  One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities.  The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock.  Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, performance stock units, options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest, our stockholders may experience further dilution.  Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders.  The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur"
11,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2021-02-08,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky.  The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results such as revenues and net earnings), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price.  These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.  In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.Risks Relating to our Business GenerallyThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The global spread of COVID-19 (including potentially more contagious strains of COVID-19 such as those recently detected in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil) has created significant volatility and uncertainty and economic disruption.  The extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors, many of which are not within our control and which we may not be able to accurately predict, including: its duration and scope; the ultimate availability, administration and effectiveness of vaccines, and our employees’ and the general population’s willingness to receive them; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services; our ability to sell and provide our services, including limitations on travel and difficulties of our clients and employees working from home; the ability of our clients to pay their insurance premiums which could impact our commission and fee revenues for our services; the nature and extent of claims impacting the ability of underwriting enterprises to pay supplemental and contingent commissions; the decrease in new arising workers’ compensation and general liability claims; the long-term impact of closing our offices and our employees working from home, including increased technology costs; the impact of lost revenue on our employees’ variable and base compensation levels; the impact of uncertainty related to salary raises and future compensation levels; the impact of reduced investments and postponements related to business modernization projects; the impact of furloughed or terminated employees; and the impact of reduced advertising and sponsorship investments. •Economy-related risks.  The decline in economic activity caused by COVID-19 has already adversely affected, and in future periods, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Continued reductions in our clients’ exposure units (such as headcount, payroll, properties, the market values of their assets, and plant, equipment and other asset utilization levels, among other factors) will reduce the amount of insurance coverage and consulting and claims administration services they need.  In addition, with unprecedented levels of unemployment and business closures during the past year, the number of newly arising workers’ compensation and general liability claims, which directly impact our fee revenues in our risk management operation, declined materially.  Certain of our industry niches, such as hospitality, transportation, manufacturing and construction, have been significantly affected by the economic decline.  The decline in economic activity due to COVID-19 has caused some of our clients to become financially less stable, and if this trend continues and clients enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and the collectability of our receivables will be adversely affected.  Clients with losses due to COVID-19, in addition to suing underwriting enterprises for insurance coverage under business interruption and other policies, may also sue us for improperly failing to procure coverage, and some clients have already done so.  In addition, in our risk management operation, we inform claimants of insurance coverage and compensability determinations on behalf of our third-party claims administration clients (including, during the past year, with respect to numerous COVID-19 related claims) on the basis of client direction or written opinions from outside counsel.  Claimants who have been denied coverage and sue our clients may also bring actions against us.  While we do not believe any such actions against us generally have merit, they could result in significant costs, damage our reputation, and/or harm our relationships with clients.  •Regulatory risks.  To mitigate the economic impact caused by COVID-19, certain governmental entities have proposed requiring underwriting enterprises to pay business interruption and workers compensation claims for COVID-19 losses despite applicable policy exclusions.  Retroactively expanding business interruption or other coverages could materially negatively affect underwriting enterprises, reduce the availability of insurance coverage, and negatively affect our ability to generate commission revenues from such policies as well as supplemental and contingent commissions from underwriting enterprises.  While some have proposed liability protections in the U.S. for companies bringing employees back into the office following the pandemic, the chances of such legislation being adopted under the current U.S. president’s administration and Democratic-led Congress may have diminished.9  •Risks related to remote work.  Many of our employees continue to work from home.  While we have not experienced any significant operating difficulties since our work-from-home practices began, the inability to meet potential and existing clients face to face has, in some cases, negatively impacted our ability to sell and provide our services.  Contingency plans related to our service center in India depend upon the normal functioning of our other offices around the world, and until that is the case, we face elevated risk in the event of a crisis rendering the India service center inoperable.  The stresses of remote work for some of our employees may decrease their productivity or make them feel detached from colleagues and the organization.  In some cases, this may make them more vulnerable to solicitations by competing firms.  In addition, our increased reliance on work-from-home technologies and our employees’ more frequent use of personal devices and non-standard business processing may increase the risk of cybersecurity or data breaches from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions.  While we do not believe the ransomware incident referred to elsewhere in this report occurred because of remote work, it serves as an important illustration of the heightened risk.COVID-19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or new strains or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this report, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price.  Further, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. An economic downturn, as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Apart from the impact of COVID-19, a decline in economic activity for any other reason (including climate change, or the uncertainty caused by political violence and chaos) could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the amount of insurance coverage and consulting services that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors.  Any such reduction or decline (whether caused by an overall economic decline or declines in certain industries or in certain countries and regions in which we operate) could adversely impact our commission revenues, consulting revenues or revenues from managing third-party insurance claims.  Some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.  The exit of the U.K. from the European Union (Brexit) could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The U.K. formally left the European Union (EU) on January 31, 2020 and an agreed implementation period ended on December 31, 2020.  Although the U.K. and the EU reached a trade and customs agreement, this agreement did not extend to insurance brokerage services.  Accordingly, while our European Economic Area (EEA) client base is a small part of our U.K. operations, we have now transferred those clients to a Swedish subsidiary, authorized in the EEA.  Some services will be provided through staff working in a U.K. branch of the subsidiary.  Although this “reverse branch” model is typical of other brokers of a similar size, there can be no assurance that the approach of EU regulators will not change, potentially requiring us to adjust our plans in relation to the U.K. branch and causing further management distraction and cost.  In such an event, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risk-taking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of receivables from certain of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance.  If those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  The failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients.  Further, the failure of errors and omissions underwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable.  Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, if underwriting enterprises merge or if a large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage, for example, because of large payouts related to climate change or other emerging risk areas, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.  10 We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefit consulting firms and, to a lesser extent, claim and risk management firms.  We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.Our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth, particularly in our brokerage segment, and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future.  Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth.  Continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms, private equity-backed consolidators and newly public insurance brokers (one of which has a partnership tax structure that gives it an advantage in pricing acquisitions) has in some cases made and could in the future make appropriate acquisition targets more difficult to identify and more expensive.  Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions, be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions.  When regulatory approval of acquisitions is required, our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator.  Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of larger acquisitions than we have historically.  See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for information regarding the size of transactions in the reporting period.Post-acquisition risks include poor cultural fit and risks relating to retention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar or complex markets or lines of business, contingencies or liabilities, such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accounting issues, the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business, and integration difficulties relating to accounting, information technology, pay equity, human resources, or employee attrition, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth.  The failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges. We own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as Casanueva Perez S.A.P. de C.V. in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full integration.We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.The insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world.  Three of the firms we compete with in the global risk management and brokerage markets (two of which are in the process of merging, subject to regulatory approval) have revenues significantly larger than ours.  In addition, many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office.  Our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms.  Over the past decade or more, private equity sponsors have invested heavily in the insurance brokerage and third party claims administration industries, creating new competitors and strengthening existing ones.  Across all of our operations, Insurtech and technology-based start-ups are entering the business.  In most cases, these businesses complement or enhance our offerings, but in some cases they compete with us.We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render, the personalized attention we provide, the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client and our ability to help our clients manage their overall risk exposure and insurance costs.  Losing business to competitors offering similar services or products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business.Consolidation among our existing competitors (such as the pending merger between Aon and Willis Towers Watson) could create additional competitive pressure on us as such firms grow their market share, take advantage of strategic and operational synergies and develop lower cost structures.  In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us.  These developments include:  •Increased capital-raising by underwriting enterprises, which could result in new risk-taking capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions; •Underwriting enterprises selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;11   •Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments; •Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance (such as a single-payer system being discussed by some in the U.S.) or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products currently offered by underwriting enterprises;  •Climate-change regulation in the U.S. and around the world moving us toward a low-carbon economy, which could create new competitive pressures around climate resilience consulting services and innovative insurance solutions;  •Continued consolidation in the financial services industry, leading to larger financial services institutions offering a wider variety of services including insurance brokerage and risk management services; and •Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services, or new distribution channels for insurance such as payroll firms and professional employer organizations.New competition as a result of these or other legislative or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services.  We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based.  Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions.  Because of market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers.  The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability.  Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to forecast our commission revenues precisely, including whether they will significantly decline.  As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance.  While historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities.  Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than a percentage of premium.  This could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided.Contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues, and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations.A meaningful portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises.  Contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period, generally in the first or second quarter, based on the growth and/or profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year.  On the other hand, supplemental revenues are paid up front, on an annual or quarterly basis, generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement.  While underwriting enterprises generally maintain supplemental revenues in the current year at a pre-determined rate, that rate can change in future years as described above.  If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability, volume or growth thresholds, as the case may be, or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  In the case of contingent revenues, under revenue recognition accounting standards, this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods. 12 If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption and developments in technology.  These may include new applications or insurance-related services based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, blockchain or new approaches to data mining.  We may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants (for example, through disintermediation) or new entrants such as technology companies, “Insurtech” start-up companies and others.  These new entrants are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence and blockchain, to simplify and improve the client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate.  We must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards.  We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace.  Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses.  Investments in technology systems (for example, technology and cybersecurity investments we are making in response to the ransomware incident referred to elsewhere in this report) may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected, or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs.  If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs.In some cases, we depend on key third-party vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives.  If these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected.Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reputation is one of our key assets.  We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, ability to protect client information, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities such as culture and values.  Our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential employees, investors, regulators and the communities in which we operate.  Negative perceptions or publicity regarding the matters noted above, including our association with clients or business partners with damaged reputations, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees, could damage our reputation.  Our reputation could also be harmed by negative perceptions or publicity regarding ESG matters including concerns with environmental matters, climate change, workforce diversity, pay equity, harassment, racial justice, cyber security and data privacy.  Any resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain clients, employees or investors, result in lower ESG ratings and exclusion of our stock from ESG-oriented indices or investment funds, or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate.  Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified talent, including our senior management team.We depend upon members of our senior management team, who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy.  We could be adversely affected if we fail to plan adequately for the succession of these leaders, including our chief executive officer, or if one or more of them contracts COVID-19.  We could also be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain talent and foster a diverse and inclusive workplace throughout our organization.  Competition for talent in rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence and data engineering is particularly intense.  In addition, our industry has experienced competition for leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers, along with their clients, business relationships and intellectual property directly to our competition.  We enter into agreements with many of our brokers and significant client-facing employees and all of our executive officers, which prohibit them from disclosing confidential information and/or soliciting our clients, prospects and employees upon their termination of employment.  The confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control, as defined in the agreements.  Although we pursue legal actions for alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action, such legal actions may not be effective in preventing such breaches, theft or infringement.  Our failure to adequately address any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  See also “Risks related to remote work” in our COVID-19 risk factor above.13  Our substantial operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S.In 2020, we generated approximately 32% of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the U.S.  The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks.  Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations outside the U.S. or create difficulties in staffing and managing such operations.  For example, we have substantial operations in India that provide important services for other parts of our global organization.  To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, rising tensions between India and China, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India.  However, such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future.  Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S.  These include, among others, risks relating to: •Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad.  These and other international regulatory risks are described below under “Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks”; •The potential costs, difficulties and risks associated with local regulations across the globe, including the risk of personal liability for directors and officers (for example, in the U.K.) and “piercing the corporate veil” risks under the corporate law regimes of certain countries; •Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations.  For example, we are building our Latin American operations (which contributed $45.8 million in revenue from 18 locations in 2020) through acquisitions of local family-owned insurance brokerage firms.  If we lose a local leader, recruiting a replacement locally or finding an internal candidate qualified to transfer to such location could be difficult; •Less flexible employee relationships, which in certain circumstances has limited our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after they are no longer employed with us or recover damages, and made it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment; •Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies.  We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars.  Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations; •Conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business; •Political and economic instability (including risks relating to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war); •Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances, multiple time zones and in different languages, including during times of crisis management; •The transition away from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a benchmark reference for short-term interest rates; •Unfavorable audits and exposure to additional liabilities relating to various non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes) in foreign jurisdictions.  In addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, discriminatory or confiscatory taxation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretation and the financial results of our international subsidiaries.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development continues to issue reports and recommendations as part of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (which we refer to as BEPS), and in response many countries in which we do business are expected to adopt rules which may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined.  For example, in response to BEPS, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand adopted rules that affect the deductibility of interest paid on intercompany debt, and other jurisdictions where we operate may do so as well in the near future.  Many jurisdictions adopted stimulus measures in response to COVID-19, many of which offered continued employment benefit subsidies, payroll tax deferrals or tax refunds that have various tax impacts for businesses; •Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;14   •Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs;  •New pandemics (in addition to COVID-19) at a regional or global level; and •Lost business or other financial harm due to protectionism in the U.S. and in countries around the world, including adverse trade policies, governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency, and governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S.The trade and military policies of the U.S. government could further develop in ways that exacerbate the risks described above, or introduce new risks for our international operations.  If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We face a variety of risks in our risk management third-party claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage and benefit consulting operations.In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a reduction in the number of claims we processed, negatively impacting our third party claims administration operations to a greater degree than the rest of our business.  This disproportionate negative impact could continue into 2021.  Our third party claims administration operations also face a variety of additional risks distinct from those faced by the rest of our business, including the risks that:  •The favorable trend among both underwriting enterprises and self-insured entities toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline; •Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due to changes in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients, or for other reasons; •Contracting terms will become less favorable or the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments; •We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or regulatory developments (including those relating to security and data privacy) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable; •Volatility in our case volumes, which are dependent upon a number of factors and difficult to forecast accurately, could impact our revenues; •If we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection); •We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain clients if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations; and •Underwriting enterprises or certain large self-insured entities may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products, and we could face additional competition from potential new entrants into the global claims management services market.If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We face a variety of risks in our benefit consulting operations distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage operations. Our benefit consulting operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations.  The portion of our revenue derived from consulting engagements and special project work is more vulnerable to reduction, postponement, cancellation or non-renewal during an economic downturn than traditional insurance brokerage commissions, and we did experience such a reduction in 2020.  If the economy is slow to recover in 2021, we could experience further deterioration in these sources of revenue.  Certain areas within our retirement consulting practice may attract a higher level of regulatory scrutiny due to regulators’ historical interest in such matters, including pension-related products and investment advisory and broker-dealer services.  In addition, we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements relating to employer-sponsored healthcare.  New laws or regulations reducing employer-sponsored health insurance could impact 15 clients’ demand for our services.  If we are unable to adapt our services to changes in the legal and regulatory landscape around employer-sponsored healthcare, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability. The cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability.  In the past, we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities.  A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets, changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities, or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years.  Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.Business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations, damage our reputation and impact client relationships. Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business.  Such a disruption could be caused by a cybersecurity incident (for example, see details regarding a ransomware incident we experienced in 2020 in the cybersecurity risk factor below), human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political violence and unrest in the U.S. or elsewhere around the world, or war.  Our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us.  See our COVID-19 risk factor above.For example, our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of RISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services.  In addition, we are increasing our use of cloud storage and cloud computing application services supported, upgraded and maintained by third-party vendors.  A disruption affecting RISX-FACS®, third-party cloud services or any other infrastructure supporting our business, including key customer relationship management software, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cause reputational harm and damage our employee and client relationships. Climate risks, including the risk of an economic crisis, risks associated with the physical effects of climate change and disruptions caused by the transition to a low-carbon economy, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The U.S. Federal Reserve recently identified climate change as a systemic risk to the economy.  It also reported that a gradual change in investor sentiment regarding climate risk introduces the possibility of abrupt tipping points or significant swings in sentiment, which could create unpredictable follow-on effects in financial markets.  If this occurred, not only would we be negatively impacted by the general economic decline, but a drop in the stock market affecting our stock price could negatively impact our ability to grow through mergers and acquisitions financed using our common stock. The transition to a low-carbon economy could harm specific industries or sectors such as oil and gas in ways that could impact our business.  Our clients in such industries could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurance-related or consulting services, which could adversely impact our commission revenues, consulting revenues or revenues from managing third-party insurance claims. Negative publicity arising from our clean coal investments or our association with clients in disfavored businesses or industries, or the perception that we are not sufficiently focused on climate risks facing Gallagher or on reducing our own carbon emissions, could damage our reputation with investors, clients, employees and regulators.  In addition, the transition to a low-carbon economy could give rise to the need for innovative insurance and risk management solutions for entirely new industries and companies, as well as advice and services to bolster climate resilience for existing companies.  If we fail to innovate in response to these changes, we could lose market share to our competitors or new market entrants that do. 16  We do not assume net underwriting risk, other than with respect to de minimis amounts necessary to provide minimum or regulatory capital, and thus do not experience direct material financial implications related to extreme weather events.  In addition, we are a professional services firm with people as our most important asset and limited physical operations.  However, if underwriting enterprises fail or withdraw from offering certain lines of coverage because of large payouts related to climate change, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.  See our risk factors further below related to our investments in IRC Section 45 clean coal operations for information regarding the potential risk of liability for environmental damage, which could be exacerbated by a heightened focus on climate change.Regulatory, Legal and Accounting RisksImproper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information and cybersecurity attacks could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation. We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, our employees and our clients.  This information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, financial information and intellectual property. We rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities, including our secure processing of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information.  Cybersecurity or data breaches of certain of the systems on which we rely have occurred, although to date we have not been materially impacted by any such breach.  In the future, breaches of any such third-party system may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions.  We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses or unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, and privacy incidents, such as loss or inadvertent transmission of data, which to date have not had a material impact on our business.  See “Update on Ransomware Incident” elsewhere in this report for information regarding an incident that occurred in 2020.Additionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems or information handling, privacy and security policies and protocols, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems and data more vulnerable to attack.  In the future, any material cybersecurity or data incidents, or media reports of the same, even if untrue, could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of clients and revenue, loss of proprietary data, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses.  Such incidents could result in confidential, personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen, used to perpetuate fraud, maliciously made public, surreptitiously modified, or rendered inaccessible for a period of time.  As we experienced in connection with the 2020 ransomware incident referred to above, during a cyber-attack we might have to take our systems offline, which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation.  Such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain.  We maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information.  Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance.  It is possible that our security controls and employee training may not be effective.  We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, policies and resources and employee training.  The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase and as technology changes.  As these threats evolve, cybersecurity and data incidents will be more difficult to detect, defend against and remediate.  If we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation.With respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors, we have processes designed to require third party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information.  However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or 17 unintentional non-compliance by a vendor’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes, or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems. Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results.We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data.  These laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors.  Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country, which may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.  Some of these laws provide rights to individuals to access, correct, and delete their personal information and to obtain copies at the expense of the business entities that process their data.  Some of these laws carry heavy penalties for violations, e.g., fines of up to 4% of worldwide revenue under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and to $7,500 per intentional violation under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).  In the U.S., there is pending federal legislation and several states have proposed their own comprehensive data privacy bills similar to the GDPR and CCPA.  In addition, in the U.S., legislators are continuing to enact comprehensive cybersecurity laws.  For example, we are subject to the New York State Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulation for Financial Services Companies and CCPA.  India and other countries where we have operations outside the U.S. have also proposed sweeping new data protection laws, in some cases including data localization laws that may require that personal data stay within their borders. Complying with enhanced obligations imposed by various new and emerging laws is resulting in significant costs of developing, implementing or securing our servers and is requiring us to allocate more resources to new privacy compliance processes and to improved technologies, adding to our IT and compliance costs.  In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase.  The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.  We are subject to regulation worldwide.  If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable.Many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the SEC, the DOJ, the IRS, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate.  Our retirement-related consulting and investment services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries.  Our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing licensing, data privacy, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries.  This regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, underwriting enterprises and third parties.  As our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization.  A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties, and/or the loss of our authorization to operate.  In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees.The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including increased staffing needs, the development of new policies, procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations, adding to our cost of doing business.  Many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance.  In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business, that we are operating our business in a compliant manner, or that our rights are otherwise protected.  In addition, major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges.  For example, China recently adopted a “blocking” statute similar to that of the EU prohibiting compliance with certain U.S. laws.  While we do not have operations in China, rising global tensions and protectionism may lead other countries where we do have operations to adopt similar measures, which could make it more difficult and costly for us to expand our operations globally.  See also “The exit of the U.K. from the European Union (Brexit) could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition” above.18 Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, or the failure of state and local governments to follow through on agreed-upon state and local tax credits or other tax related incentives, could adversely affect our results of operations or require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business.  For example, the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest.  The potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions.  The vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees.  We receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises, separate from retail commissions and fees, including, among other things, contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them.  Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts.  Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients, underwriting enterprises or other business partners.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA, which significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%; limiting the deductibility of interest expense; implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  In light of the results of the recent U.S. presidential and congressional elections, the U.S. may pass legislation reversing part or all of the TCJA and corresponding regulations, and our tax rate could increase. We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws, sanctioned parties restrictions, and FATCA.In countries outside the U.S., a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act.  Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls.  We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption.  In such parts of the world, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws.  In addition, in recent years, two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.S. and the U.K. for improper payments to foreign officials.  These firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements.   Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance, including investigating business practices and taking steps to address the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and/or such laws and regulations.  We use third party partners and agents in certain jurisdictions where it is common industry practice to do so.  Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm.  Although we have not been materially impacted by any such violations, within the past year, we investigated certain business practices that violated our policies and terminated those found to be involved.We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate trade sanctions laws of the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions in which we operate.  In addition, FATCA requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees and our failure to do so properly could result in penalties.  We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results. We are or have been subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.  Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, (including with respect to business interruption or other potential coverage for COVID‑19 losses), report claims on behalf of clients, provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or provide clients with appropriate consulting, advisory, pension and claims handling services.  There is the risk that our employees or sub-agents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis.  Certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decision-making services to clients.  If these clients experience investment losses, our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business.  Where appropriate, we have established provisions against these matters that we 19 believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments.  The damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or other extraordinary damages.  It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results.  In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure.  We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters.  Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable.  These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant.As more fully described in Note 17 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements, we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business, including but not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action.  We are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business.  For example, our micro-captive advisory services business has been under investigation by the IRS since 2013.  In addition, we are defending a lawsuit (along with Chem-Mod LLC and other defendants) asserting infringement of patents held by Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and MES Inc.  We cannot reasonably predict the outcomes of these or other matters that we may become involved with in the future.  An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period, or on an ongoing basis.  In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, any such matter could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.  Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP).  These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements.  We are also required to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the disclosed and recorded amounts of revenues and expenses related to revenue recognition and deferred costs - see Note 4 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements.  We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments (including our IRC Section 45 investments), income taxes, revenue recognition, deferred costs, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances.  Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.  Further, as additional guidance relating to the TCJA is released or if the current U.S. president’s administration takes action to reverse portions of the TCJA, our estimates related to the TCJA may change.  Additionally, changes in accounting standards (such as the changed lease standards - see Note 2 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements) could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.  Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common StockOur clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our ability to generate returns, claim tax deductions and avoid write-offs in connection with our IRC Section 45 and IRC Section 29 investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties including those set forth below.  Our IRC Section 45 investments’ ability to generate additional tax credits is scheduled to end in December 2021. •Environmental, political and regulatory concerns.  Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and coal combustion waste have led to public pressure to reduce or regulations that discourage the burning of coal, even refined coal treated by technologies such as The Chem-Mod™ Solution.  In recent years there has been some negative publicity around our IRC Section 45 investments and clean coal generally, and certain members of Congress have raised questions about the methodologies clean coal refiners use to validate emission reductions under IRC Section 45.  Negative publicity of this kind could exacerbate the risk referred to above or call into question the validity of existing tax credits.  Additionally, several states have enacted mandates that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar, nuclear and geothermal.  If utilities burned less coal as a result of any such regulation, including state or federal laws that otherwise limit coal-fired generation, our ability to generate additional tax credits would be reduced.20  •Market demand for coal.  When the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn natural gas or oil instead of coal.  Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an increase in the use of power from renewable sources, trade protection measures, an economic slowdown (including the current economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic) or mild weather and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity.  If utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, our ability to generate additional tax credits would be reduced. •Intellectual property and litigation risks.  There is a risk that foreign laws will not protect the intellectual property associated with The Chem-Mod™ Solution to the same extent as U.S. laws, leaving us vulnerable to companies outside the U.S. who may attempt to copy such intellectual property.  In addition, other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod™ Solution.  Such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod (or us and our investment and operational partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable on favorable terms, if at all.  On July 17, 2019, Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and MES Inc. (together, Midwest Energy) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against us, Chem‑Mod LLC and numerous other related and unrelated parties (some of whom are seeking indemnification from Chem-Mod LLC).  The complaint alleges that the named defendants infringe patents held exclusively by Midwest Energy and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief.  We dispute the allegations contained in the complaint and intend to defend this matter vigorously.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and, accordingly it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters.  While we believe the probability of a material loss is remote, if plaintiffs prevail on the infringement suit, or defendants cannot obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, that may limit the use of The Chem-Mod™ Solution by certain licensees. •IRS audits.  Several of the refined coal partnerships in which we are an investor are under audit by the IRS.  One of these partnerships received a notice from the IRS disallowing our co-investors from claiming tax credits.  The partnership defended its position in tax court and prevailed in August 2019.  The IRS is appealing this ruling.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and accordingly it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or other IRS audits, and their potential impact on us. •Operational risks.  Chem-Mod’s multi-pollutant reduction technologies (The Chem-ModTM Solution) require chemicals that may not be readily available in the marketplace at reasonable costs.  Utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers, disruptions in the supply or transportation of coal, revocation of their Chem-Mod technologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operations.  Long-term operations using Chem-Mod’s multi-pollutant reduction technologies could also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short- or medium-term.  A serious injury or death of a worker connected with the production of refined coal using Chem-Mod’s technologies could expose the operations to material liabilities, jeopardizing our investment, and could lead to reputational harm.  We could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, causes our interests and those of our co-investors to diverge.  Finally, our vendors responsible for operation and management could fail to run the operations in compliance with IRC Section 45.  If any of these developments occur, our investment returns may be negatively impacted. •Incompatible coal.  If utilities purchase coal of a quality or type incompatible with their boilers and operations, treating such coal through a commercial refined coal plant could magnify the negative impacts of burning such coal.  As a result, refined coal plants at such utilities may be removed from production until all the incompatible coal has been burned, which could reduce their ability to generate tax credits. We began generating tax credits under IRC Section 45 in 2009.  As of December 31, 2020, we had generated a total of $1,512.7 million in IRC Section 45 tax credits, of which approximately $534.9 million have been used to offset U.S. federal tax liabilities and $977.8 million remain unused and available to offset future U.S. federal tax liabilities.  Our ability to use tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon the operations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.  These include, among others, the “placed-in-service” condition and requirements relating to qualified emissions reductions, coal sales to unrelated parties and at least one of the operations’ owners qualifying as a “producer” of refined coal.  While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.  Similarly, the law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits (related to our prior synthetic coal operations) expired on December 31, 2007.  At December 31, 2020, we had exposure with respect to $108.0 million of previously earned tax credits under IRC Section 29.  We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years was in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest.  We understand 21 these private letter rulings were consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and we have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them.  In addition, the IRS audited certain of the IRC Section 29 facilities without requiring any changes.While none of our prior IRC Section 29 operations are currently under audit, several of the IRC Section 45 operations in which we are invested are under audit by the IRS.  See “IRS Audits” above.  The IRS could place the remaining IRC Section 45 operations and any of the prior IRC Section 29 operations under audit.  An adverse outcome with respect to our ability to claim tax credits under any such audit would likely cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in IRC Section 29 tax credits.The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety.  Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals.  There are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability.  Failure of The Chem-Mod™ Solution utilized at coal-fired generation facilities, for example, could result in violations of air emissions permits, which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability.  Additionally, some environmental laws, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, impose liability on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise responsible for, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment.  One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties.  By using The Chem‑Mod™ Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating.  Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod™ Solution.  Increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of regulatory attention and private litigation.  For example, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a public nuisance.  In addition to the possibility of our being named in such actions, we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod™ Solution.  No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators, or other end users, will result in that facility owner or operator, or other end user, accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim.  Nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators, or other end users, will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and this could result in environmental or product liability claims.  It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, nuisance, diminution of property value, or similar claims.  Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim, and defense of such claims can be costly, even when such defense prevails.  If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. As of December 31, 2020, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $4.5 billion.  The level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility.  We also bear risk at the time our debt matures.  Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations.  This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates.  A small portion of our private placement debt consists of floating rate notes and interest payments under our senior revolving credit facility are based on a floating rate (in both cases currently based on LIBOR, which is expected to transition at the end of 2021 to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate), which exposes us to the risk of a changing or unknown rate environment.  Our indebtedness will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and general corporate purposes.  If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that 22 would otherwise benefit our business.  Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments, and require us to comply with certain financial and legal covenants.  The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.  We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends.  We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  A failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.  The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries. We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries.  As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses.  In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations, pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.Further, we derive a meaningful portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S.  Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. in the event we are unable to meet these U.S. based cash requirements. Funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. may be repatriated to the U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings, where necessary.  A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner.In the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations, including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock, could be adversely affected.Future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. An important way we grow our business is through acquisitions.  One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities.  The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock.  Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, performance stock units, options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest, our stockholders may experience further dilution.  Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders.  The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur. 23  "
0,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2020-02-07,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.  Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results such as revenues and net earnings), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.  Risks Relating to our Business Generally  An economic downturn, as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  A decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the amount of insurance coverage and consulting services that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. In addition, specific industries or sectors of the economy could experience declines in ways that impact our business. For example, if climate change and environmental risks harm certain industries like oil and gas, our clients in those industries could go out of business or have reduced needs for insurance coverage or consulting services. To cite another example, if an increase in consumer preference for car- and ride-sharing services results in a long-term reduction in vehicle use, the automobile insurance industry could decline. Any such reduction or decline (whether caused by an overall economic decline or declines in certain industries) could adversely impact our commission revenues, consulting revenues or revenues from managing third-party insurance claims. Some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected. The exit of the U.K. from the European Union (Brexit) could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations in the U.K., which contributed approximately 19% of our brokerage segment and approximately 4% of our risk management segment revenues in 2019, expose us to risk in the event of an economic downturn in the U.K. due to Brexit. Such a downturn could adversely affect our U.K. operations through a decline in the insurance coverage and consulting services our clients purchase as they face reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties or the market value of their assets. Following approval by the European Union and the U.K. parliaments, the U.K. formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. The U.K. is now expected to be in an implementation period until December 31, 2020 (any further extension would require U.K. legislation to be changed). During this period, the U.K. will still follow all the European Union’s rules and regulations, will remain in the single market and the customs union, and will permit the free movement of people. There is no formal stated intent by the U.K. or European Economic Area (EEA) authorities to put in place, at the end of the implementation period, an arrangement under which U.K.-based insurance brokers will continue to be able to exercise “passporting rights” to provide services to clients in the EEA. Accordingly, while our EEA client base is a small part of our U.K. operations, our expectation is that EEA clients will need to be serviced by a subsidiary authorized in the EEA. While we have a plan in place to transfer those clients to a Swedish subsidiary, such a transition could be a distraction to both clients and our management. In addition, under our business model in the U.K. some services will be provided through staff working in a U.K. branch of the subsidiary. There can be no assurance that applicable EU regulations will not change, potentially requiring us to adjust our plans and causing further management distraction and cost. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has and may continue to result in substantial volatility in foreign exchange markets, which could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results, and may lead to a sustained weakness in the British pound’s exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. Any significant weakening of the British pound to the U.S. dollar will have an adverse impact on our brokerage and risk management segments’ net earnings as reported in U.S. dollars.  Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risk-taking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the underwriting enterprises with which we place insurance. If those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients, and the failure of errors and omissions underwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if underwriting enterprises merge or if a large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage, for example, because of large payouts related to climate change or other emerging risk areas, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.     10      We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefit consulting firms and, to a lesser extent, claim and risk management firms. We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.  Our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth, particularly in our brokerage segment, and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth. Continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms, private equity-backed consolidators and newly public insurance brokers (one of which has a partnership tax structure that gives it an advantage in pricing acquisitions) could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive. Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions, be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions. When regulatory approval of acquisitions is required, our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator. Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically.  Post-acquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business, contingencies or liabilities, such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accounting issues, the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business, and integration difficulties relating to accounting, information technology, pay equity, human resources, employee attrition or poor organizational culture and fit, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth. The failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges.  We own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as Casanueva Perez S.A.P. de C.V. in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full integration.  We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.  The insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world. Three of the firms we compete with in the global risk management and brokerage markets have revenues significantly larger than ours. In addition, many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. Our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms. Over the past decade or more, private equity sponsors have invested heavily in the insurance brokerage and third party claims administration industries, creating new competitors and strengthening existing ones.  We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render, the personalized attention we provide, the individual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client and our ability to help our clients manage their overall insurance costs. Losing business to competitors offering similar services or products at a lower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business.  Consolidation among our existing competitors could create additional competitive pressure on us as such firms grow their market share, take advantage of strategic and operational synergies and develop lower cost structures. In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us.  These developments include:   •Increased capital-raising by underwriting enterprises, which could result in new risk-taking capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions;               •Underwriting enterprises selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;               •Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments;               •Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products currently offered by underwriting enterprises;               •Continued consolidation in the financial services industry, leading to larger financial services institutions offering a wider variety of services including insurance brokerage and risk management services; and                 11       •Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services, or new distribution channels for insurance such as payroll firms and professional employer organizations.              New competition as a result of these or other legislative or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.  We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. Because of market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As underwriting enterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to forecast our commission revenues precisely, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations. In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance  capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities. Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates. This could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and might not increase with premiums as commissions do or with the level of service provided. Contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues, and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations.  A significant portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises. Contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period, generally in the first or second quarter, based on the growth and/or profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year. On the other hand, supplemental revenues are paid up front, on an annual or quarterly basis, generally based on our historical premium volumes with the underwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement. If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprise’s particular profitability, volume or growth thresholds, as the case may be, or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In the case of contingent revenues, under the changed revenue recognition accounting standard, effective January 1, 2018, this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized in prior periods (See Note 2 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements for more information).  If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption and developments in technology. These may include new applications or insurance-related services based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, blockchain or new approaches to data mining. We may be exposed to competitive risks related to the adoption and application of new technologies by established market participants (for example, through disintermediation) or new entrants such as technology companies, “Insurtech” start-up companies and others. These new entrants are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence and blockchain, to simplify and improve the client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate. We must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs.    12        In some cases, we depend on key third-party vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives. If these third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected.  Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our reputation is one of our key assets. We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, ability to protect client information, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities such as culture and values. Our success is also dependent on maintaining a good reputation with existing and potential employees, investors and regulators. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding the matters noted above, including our association with clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees, could damage our reputation. Our reputation could also be impacted by negative perceptions or publicity regarding environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues or cybersecurity and data privacy concerns. Any resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain clients, employees and investors or harm our relationships with regulators, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified talent, including our senior management team.  We depend upon members of our senior management team, who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and strategy. We could be adversely affected if we fail to plan adequately for the succession of these leaders, including our chief executive officer. We could also be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain talent throughout our organization. Competition for talent in rapidly developing fields such as artificial intelligence and data engineering is particularly intense. In addition, our industry has experienced competition for leading brokers and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers, along with their clients, business relationships and intellectual property directly to our competition. Our failure to adequately address any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  Our substantial operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S.  In 2019, we generated approximately 31% of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the U.S. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations outside the U.S. or create difficulties in staffing and managing such operations. For example, we have substantial operations in India that provide important services for other parts of our global organization. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future. Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S. These include, among others, risks relating to:   •Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad. These and other international regulatory risks are described below under “Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks;”           •The potential costs, difficulties and risks associated with local regulations across the globe, including the risk of personal liability for directors and officers and “piercing the corporate veil” risks under the corporate law regimes of certain countries;           •Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. For example, we are building our Latin American operations (which contributed $37.4 million in revenue from 18 locations in 2019) through acquisitions of local family-owned insurance brokerage firms. If we lose a local leader, recruiting a replacement locally or finding an internal candidate qualified to transfer to such location could be difficult;           •Less flexible employee relationships, which in certain circumstances has limited our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after they are no longer employed with us or recovering damages, and made it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;           •Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations;             13         •Conflicting regulations in the countries in which we do business;           •Political and economic instability (including risks relating to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);           •Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances, multiple time zones and in different languages, including during times of crisis management;           •Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;           •The transition away from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a benchmark reference for short-term interest rates;           •Unfavorable audits and exposure to additional liabilities relating to various non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes) in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, discriminatory or confiscatory taxation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretation and the financial results of our international subsidiaries. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued reports and recommendations as part of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (which we refer to as BEPS), and in response many countries in which we do business are expected to adopt rules which may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined. For example, in response to BEPS, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand adopted rules that affect the deductibility of interest paid on intercompany debt, and other jurisdictions where we operate may do so as well in the near future;           •Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;           •Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs;           •Pandemics such as coronavirus;           •Lost business or other financial harm due to governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency, including protectionist policies that discriminate in favor of local competitors; and           •Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S.          The trade and military policies of the U.S. government could further develop in ways that exacerbate the risks described above, or introduce new risks for our international operations. If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We face a variety of risks in our risk management third-party claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage and benefit consulting operations.  Our third party claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations, including the risks that:   •The favorable trend among both underwriting enterprises and self-insured entities toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline;           •Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due to changes in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients, or for other reasons;           •Contracting terms will become less favorable or the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments;           •We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or regulatory developments (including those relating to security and data privacy) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;           •Volatility in our case volumes, which are dependent upon a number of factors and difficult to forecast accurately, could impact our revenues;           •Economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a reduction in the number of claims we process;           •If we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);             14         •We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain clients if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations; and           •Underwriting enterprises or certain large self-insured entities may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products.          If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability.  The cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. In the past, we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets, changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities, or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.  Business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations, damage our reputation and impact client relationships.  Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business. Such a disruption could be caused by human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, or war. Our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us. For example, our third party claims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of RISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services. In addition, we are increasing our use of cloud storage and cloud computing application services supported, upgraded and maintained by third-party vendors. A disruption affecting RISX-FACS®, third-party cloud services or any other infrastructure supporting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cause reputational harm and damage our employee and client relationships.  Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks  Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information and cybersecurity attacks could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation.  We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, our employees and our clients. This information includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, financial information and intellectual property.  We rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities, including our secure processing of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information. Cybersecurity or data breaches of any of the systems on which we rely may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions. We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses or unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, and privacy incidents, such as loss or inadvertent transmission of data, which to date have not had a material impact on our business.  Additionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems or information handling, privacy and security policies and protocols, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems and data more vulnerable to attack. In the future, any material cybersecurity or data incidents, or media reports of the same, even if untrue, could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of clients and revenue, loss of proprietary data, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard clients’ information or financial losses. Such incidents could result in confidential, personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen, used to perpetuate fraud, maliciously made public, surreptitiously modified, or rendered inaccessible for a period of time. During a cyber-attack we might have to take our systems offline, which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation. Such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain.     15         We maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance. It is possible that our security controls and employee training may not be effective.  We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, policies and resources and employee training. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase and as technology changes. As these threats evolve, cybersecurity and data incidents will be more difficult to detect, defend against and remediate. If we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.  Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation.  With respect to our commercial arrangements with third party vendors, we have processes designed to require third party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendor’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes, or a cyber attack on a vendor’s information systems. Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results.  We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. These laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country, which may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Some of these laws provide rights to individuals to access, correct, and delete their personal information and to obtain copies at the expense of the business entities that process their data. Some of these laws carry heavy penalties for violations, e.g., fines of up to 4% of worldwide revenue under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and to $7,500 per intentional violation under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). In the U.S., several states have proposed their own comprehensive data privacy bills similar to the GDPR and CCPA.  In addition, in the U.S., legislators are continuing to enact comprehensive cybersecurity laws. For example, we are subject to the New York State Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulation for Financial Services Companies and CCPA. India has also proposed sweeping new data protection laws, in some cases including data localization laws that may require that personal data stay within their borders.  Complying with enhanced obligations imposed by various new and emerging laws is resulting in significant costs of developing, implementing or securing our servers and is requiring us to allocate more resources to new privacy compliance processes and to improved technologies, adding to our IT and compliance costs. In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.  We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable.  Many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Department of Justice, the IRS, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia and insurance regulators in nearly every jurisdiction in which we operate. Our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing licensing, data privacy, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, underwriting enterprises and third parties. As our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization. A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees. The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including increased staffing needs, the development of new policies, procedures and internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations, adding to our cost of doing business. Many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting     16         legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business, that we are operating our business in a compliant manner, or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, major political and legal developments in jurisdictions in which we do business may lead to new regulatory costs and challenges. See “The exit of the U.K. from the European Union (Brexit) could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.”  Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business.  For example, the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past because of the potential for conflicts of interest. The potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions. The vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees. We receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises, separate from retail commissions and fees, including, among other things, contingent and supplemental revenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them. Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts. Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients, underwriting enterprises or other business partners.  In addition, we have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements relating to employer sponsored healthcare. Depending on future changes to health legislation, these investments may not yield returns. Certain presidential candidates and key members of Congress have expressed a desire to establish alternatives to employer-sponsored health insurance or replace it with government-sponsored health insurance, including “Medicare-for-all” and related proposals. If we are unable to adapt our services to future changes in the legal and regulatory landscape around employer sponsored healthcare, our ability to grow our business or provide effective services, particularly in our employee benefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. If our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored healthcare in response to any future law or regulation, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws, sanctioned parties restrictions, and FATCA.  In foreign countries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act. Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls. Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to programs to ensure compliance. However, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws. In addition, in recent years, two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.S. and the U.K. for improper payments to foreign officials. These firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements.  We remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations. Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm.  We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate trade sanctions laws of the U.S., the European Union and other jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, FATCA requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees. In the event we do not obtain valid FATCA documents, we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments. This obligation is shared with our clients who may fail to comply, in whole or in part. In such circumstances, we may incur FATCA compliance costs including withholding taxes, interest and penalties. Recent regulatory developments related to FATCA could also cause short-term increases in our costs related to systems and process updates needed for us to be able to take advantage of such changes. In addition, the impact of Brexit on FATCA reporting for EU placements may further increase our compliance burden and cost of operations and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may have an adverse effect on us, and such effect may be material.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%; limiting the deductibility of interest expense; implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Some aspects of the Tax Act are still unclear and will continue to be clarified over time. While we have updated estimates of the tax impacts based on guidance released to date or interpretations under such guidance, other guidance could be issued in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.     17       We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.  We are or have been subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or provide clients with appropriate consulting, advisory, pension and claims handling services. There is the risk that our employees or sub-agents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. Certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investment advice or decision-making services to clients. If these clients experience investment losses, our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business. We have established provisions against these matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments. The damages claimed in such matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or other extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant. As more fully described in Note 17 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements, we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to our business, including but not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action. We are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business. For example, our micro-captive advisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the IRS and clients of that business brought a lawsuit against us alleging that the tax benefits associated with their micro-captives were disallowed by the IRS. In addition, we are defending a lawsuit (along with Chem-Mod LLC and other defendants) asserting infringement of patents held by Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and MES Inc. We cannot reasonably predict the outcomes of these or other matters that we may become involved with in the future. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period, or on an ongoing basis. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, any such matter could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the disclosed and recorded amounts of revenues and expenses related to the impact of the adoption of and accounting under Topic 606. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments (including our IRC Section 45 investments), income taxes, revenue recognition, deferred costs, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. Further, as additional guidance relating to the Tax Act is released, our estimates related to the Tax Act may change. Additionally, changes in accounting standards (such as the changed revenue recognition and lease standards - see Note 2 to our 2019 consolidated financial statements) could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.     18       Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common Stock  Our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  Our ability to generate returns, claim tax deductions and avoid write-offs in connection with our IRC Section 45 and IRC Section 29 investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties including those set forth below.   •Environmental, political and regulatory concerns. Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardous nature of coal combustion waste have led to public pressure to reduce or regulations that discourage the burning of coal, even refined coal treated by technologies such as The Chem-Mod™ Solution. Within the past year there has been some negative publicity around our IRC Section 45 investments and clean coal generally, and certain members of Congress have raised questions about the methodologies clean coal refiners use to validate emission reductions under IRC Section 45. Negative publicity of this kind could exacerbate the risk referred to above or call into question the validity of existing tax credits. Additionally, several states have enacted mandates that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar, nuclear and geothermal. There have also been proposals to establish a similar national standard, although none have been enacted to date. If utilities burned less coal as a result of any such regulation, our ability to generate additional tax credits would be reduced.                   •Demand for commercial refined coal plants. Changes in circumstances may cause a commercial refined coal plant to be moved to a different power generation facility, which could require us to invest additional capital. The implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permitting requirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits and changes in presidential administrations. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the Environmental Protection Agency could negatively impact power generational facilities’ demand for commercial refined coal plants, should we need to move them. Sustained low natural gas prices could cause utilities to phase out or close existing coal-fired power plants. In addition, certain financing sources and insurance companies have taken action to limit available financing and insurance coverage for the development of new coal-fueled power plants, which could also limit the demand for refined coal facilities at power plants should we need to move one of our existing facilities.                   •Market demand for coal. When the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn natural gas or oil instead of coal. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an increase in the use of power from renewable sources, trade protection measures, an economic slowdown or mild weather and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. If utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, our ability to generate additional tax credits would be reduced.                   •Intellectual property and litigation risks. There is a risk that foreign laws will not protect the intellectual property associated with The Chem-Mod™ Solution to the same extent as U.S. laws, leaving us vulnerable to companies outside the U.S. who may attempt to copy such intellectual property. In addition, other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod™ Solution. Such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod (or us and our investment and operational partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable on favorable terms, if at all. On July 17, 2019, Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. and MES Inc. (together, Midwest Energy) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against us, Chem-Mod LLC and numerous other related and unrelated parties (some of whom are seeking indemnification from Chem-Mod LLC). The complaint alleges that the named defendants infringe two patents held exclusively by Midwest Energy and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations contained in the complaint and intend to defend this matter vigorously. Litigation is inherently uncertain and, accordingly it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. While we believe the probability of a material loss is remote, if plaintiffs prevail on the infringement suit, or defendants cannot obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, that may limit the use of The Chem-Mod™ Solution by certain licensees.                   •IRS audits. Several of the refined coal partnerships in which we are an investor are under audit by the IRS. One of these partnerships received a notice from the IRS disallowing our co-investors from claiming tax credits. The partnership defended its position in tax court and prevailed in August 2019. The IRS is appealing this ruling. Litigation is inherently uncertain and accordingly it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or other IRS audits, and their potential impact on us.                   •Operational risks. Chem-Mod’s multi-pollutant reduction technologies (The Chem-ModTM Solution) require chemicals that may not be readily available in the marketplace at reasonable costs. Utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers, disruptions in the supply or transportation of coal, revocation of their Chem-Mod technologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operations. Long-term operations using Chem-Mod’s multi-pollutant reduction technologies could also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short- or medium-term. A serious injury or death of a worker connected with the production of refined coal using Chem-Mod’s technologies could expose the operations to material liabilities, jeopardizing our                     19       investment, and could lead to reputational harm. We could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, causes our interests and those of our co-investors to diverge. Finally, our vendors responsible for operation and management could fail to run the operations in compliance with IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, our investment returns may be negatively impacted.                   •Incompatible coal. If utilities purchase coal of a quality or type incompatible with their boilers and operations, treating such coal through a commercial refined coal plant could magnify the negative impacts of burning such coal. As a result, refined coal plants at such utilities may be removed from production until the incompatible coal has all been burned, which could cause us to be unable to take full advantage of the tax credits.                   •Strategic alternatives risk. While we currently expect to continue to hold at least a portion of our IRC Section 45 investments, if for any reason in the future we decide to sell more of our interests, the discount rate on future cash flows could be excessive, and could result in an impairment of our investment.                  We began generating tax credits under IRC Section 45 in 2009. As of December 31, 2019, we had generated a total of $1,364 million ($1.364 billion) in IRC Section 45 tax credits, of which approximately $427.0 million have been used to offset U.S. federal tax liabilities and $937.0 million remain unused and available to offset future U.S. federal tax liabilities. Our ability to use tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon the operations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. These include, among others, the “placed-in-service” condition and requirements relating to qualified emissions reductions, coal sales to unrelated parties and at least one of the operations’ owners qualifying as a “producer” of refined coal. While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. Similarly, the law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits (related to our prior synthetic coal operations) expired on December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2019, we had exposure with respect to $108.0 million of previously earned tax credits under IRC Section 29. We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years was in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest. We understand these private letter rulings were consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and we have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them. In addition, the IRS audited certain of the IRC Section 29 facilities without requiring any changes. While none of our prior IRC Section 29 operations are currently under audit, many of the IRC Section 45 operations in which we are invested are under audit by the IRS. The IRS could place the remaining IRC Section 45 operations and any of the prior IRC Section 29 operations under audit. An adverse outcome with respect to our ability to claim tax credits under any such audit would likely cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in IRC Section 29 tax credits.  The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs.  The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. There are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability. Failure of The Chem-Mod™ Solution utilized at coal-fired generation facilities, for example, could result in violations of air emissions permits, which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability. Additionally, some environmental laws, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise responsible for, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem-Mod™ Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod™ Solution. Increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of regulatory attention and private litigation. For example, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a public nuisance. In addition to the possibility of our being named in such actions, we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod™ Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators, or other end users, will result in that facility owner or operator, or other end user, accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim. Nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators, or other end users, will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and this could result in environmental or product liability claims. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to    20       also include claims for personal injury, property damage, nuisance, diminution of property value, or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim, and defense of such claims can be costly, even when such defense prevails. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.  As of December 31, 2019, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $4.6 billion. The level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility. We also bear risk at the time our debt matures. Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates. A small portion of our private placement debt consists of floating rate notes and interest payments under our senior revolving credit facility are based on a floating rate (in both cases currently based on LIBOR, which is expected to transition soon to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate), which exposes us to the risk of a changing or unknown rate environment. Our indebtedness will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and general corporate purposes. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments, and require us to comply with certain financial and legal covenants. The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. A failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.  We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations, pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.  Further, we derive a meaningful portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. in the event we are unable to meet these U.S. based cash requirements.  Funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. may be repatriated to the U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings, where necessary. A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner. In the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance our obligations, including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock, could be adversely affected.     21       Future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, performance stock units, options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest, our stockholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.  The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.  The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, including the risk factors described above, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:   •General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism;       •Quarterly variations in our operating results;       •Seasonality of our business cycle;       •Changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;       •Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;       •Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the insurance brokerage or financial services industries in general;       •Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;       •News reports relating to trends in our markets, including any expectations regarding an upcoming “hard” or “soft” market;       •Cyber attacks and other cybersecurity incidents;       •Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;       •Material announcements by us or our competitors;       •The impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our investments, including the possible perception by securities analysts or investors that such investments divert management attention from our core operations;       •Market volatility;       •A negative market reaction to announced acquisitions;       •Competitive pressures in any of our segments;       •General conditions in the insurance brokerage and insurance industries;       •Legal proceedings or regulatory investigations;       •Regulatory requirements, including international sanctions and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 or other anti-corruption laws;       •Quarter-to-quarter volatility in the earnings impact of IRC Section 45 tax credits from our clean energy investments, due to the application of accounting standards applicable to the recognition of tax credits; and       •Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur.      Stockholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources"
9,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2018-02-12,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Risks Relating to our Business Generally An overall economic downturn, as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate, could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.  An overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as aresult of reductions in the overall amount of consulting services and insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. Such reductions couldalso adversely impact future commission revenues when the underwriting enterprises perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. We record the commission income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when theadjustments become known and, as a result, any downturn or improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag a downturn or improvement in the economy. Some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financialdifficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate theiroperations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected. Our substantial operations outside the U.S. expose us to risk even when economic activity is strong in the U.S. For example, our operations in theU.K., which contributed approximately 18% of our brokerage segment and approximately 4% of our risk management segment revenues in 2017, expose us to risk in the event of an economic downturn in the U.K. due to Brexit. Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risk-taking capital capacity could adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition.  We have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of theunderwriting enterprises with which we place insurance. If those companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact onour consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients, and the failure of errors and omissionsunderwriting enterprises could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if underwriting enterprises merge or ifa large underwriting enterprise fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage, overall risk-taking capital capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduceour revenues and profitability.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriouslyundermine our profitability.  We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services. We do not determine theinsurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. Because of market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict orcontrol, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As underwritingenterprises continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission ratespayable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premiumpricing changes, it is difficult to precisely forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loanrepayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.  In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives,rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. Whilehistorically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realizedfrom our traditional brokerage activities. Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates. Thiscould negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premiums as commissions do.   12 Table of ContentsContingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable thanstandard commission revenues, and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations.  Asignificant portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental revenues from underwriting enterprises. Contingent revenues are paid after the insurance contract period, generally in the first or second quarter, based on the growthand/or profitability of business we placed with an underwriting enterprise during the prior year. On the other hand, supplemental revenues are paid up front, on an annual or quarterly basis, generally based on our historical premium volumes with theunderwriting enterprise and additional capabilities or services we bring to the engagement. If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet an underwriting enterprises particular profitability, volumeor growth thresholds, as the case may be, or such companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent revenues or supplemental revenues could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affectour results of operations. In the case of contingent revenues, under the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which is effective January 1, 2018, this could lead to the reversal of revenues in future periods that were recognized inprior periods (See Note 2 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for more information).  We face significant competitivepressures in each of our businesses.  The insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting businesses are highly competitive and manyinsurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting organizations actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world. We compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenuessignificantly larger than ours. In addition, many other smaller firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or largerthan those of our corresponding local office. Our third party claims administration operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms.  We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render, the personalized attention we provide, theindividual and corporate expertise of the brokers and consultants providing the actual service to the client and our ability to help our clients manage their overall insurance costs. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at alower cost or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business.  In addition, any increase in competition due to newlegislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:      Increased capital-raising by underwriting enterprises, which could result in new risk-taking capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lowerinsurance premiums and commissions;      Underwriting enterprises selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;     Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments;     Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas orother alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products currently offered by underwriting enterprises; and     Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offeringrisk management or insurance brokerage services, or new distribution channels for insurance such as payroll firms.  Newcompetition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   13 Table of ContentsIf we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients throughtechnology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adverselyaffected.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruptionand other technology change. The threat may come from established market participants through disintermediation as well as from new entrants. We must also develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees thatanticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely andcost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer newtechnologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth and complianceprograms.  In some cases, we depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives. Ifthese third parties fail to perform their obligations or cease to work with us, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected.  Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Ourreputation is one of our key assets. We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, abilityto protect client information, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or other matters, including our association with clients or business partnerswho themselves have a damaged reputation, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees, could damage our reputation. Any resulting erosion of trust and confidence among existing and potential clients, regulators, stockholders and otherparties important to the success of our business could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefit consulting firms and, to a lesser extent, claim and risk management firms.We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations. Our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth, particularly in our brokerage segment, and we believe that similaracquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth. Continuing consolidation in our industry and growinginterest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equity-backed consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive. Even if we are able toidentify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions, be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historicallyexperienced from acquisitions. When regulatory approval of acquisitions is required, our ability to complete acquisitions may be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator. Our ability to finance andintegrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically.  Post-acquisitionrisks include those relating to retention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business, contingencies or liabilities, such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the FCPA and U.K.Bribery Act, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accounting issues, the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business, and integration difficultiesrelating to accounting, information technology, human resources, or organizational culture and fit, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth. The failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipatedrevenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges.  We own interests in firms where we do not exercise managementcontrol (such as Casanueva Perez S.A.P. de C.V. in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full integration.   14 Table of ContentsOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualifiedpersonnel.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain both new talent and experienced personnel, includingour senior management, brokers and other key personnel. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intensecompetition for the services of leading brokers, and in the past we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers, along with their client and business relationships, to competitors. Such departures could lead to the loss of clients and intellectualproperty. The loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers, brokers or other key personnel (including the key personnel that manage our interests in our IRC Section 45 investments), or our inability to identify,recruit and retain highly skilled personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our substantial operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S. In 2017, we generated approximately 31% of our combined brokerage and risk management revenues outside the U.S., including in countries where the risk ofpolitical and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the U.S. and more stable countries. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarilyor permanently disrupt our operations in these countries or create difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. For example, we have substantial operations in India to provide certain back-office services. To date, the dispute betweenIndia and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect our operations there in thefuture. Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S.These include, among others, risks relating to:      Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties,environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad. These and other international regulatory risks are described below under Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks;     The potential costs, difficulties and risks associated with local regulations across the globe, including the risk of personal liability for directorsand officers and piercing the corporate veil risks under the corporate law regimes of certain countries;      Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. For example we built our South American operations (which contributed $28.4 million inrevenue from six locations in 2017) through acquisitions of local family-owned insurance brokerage firms, and if we lost a local leader, recruiting a local replacement for such leader, or finding an internal candidate qualified to transfer tosuch location, could be difficult;      Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after they are no longer employed withus or recovering damages in the event they do so, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;      Political and economic instability (including risks relating to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments, acts of terrorism andoutbreaks of war);      Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances, multiple time zones and in different languages, including during times ofcrisis management;      Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;     Unfavorable audits and exposure to additional liabilities relating to various non-income taxes (such aspayroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes) in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, discriminatory or confiscatory taxation,changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretation and the financial results of our international subsidiaries. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued reports andrecommendations as part of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (BEPS), and in response many countries in which we do business are expected to adopt rules which may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our taxobligations are determined. For example, in response to BEPS, the U.K. adopted rules in 2016 that affect the deductibility of interest paid on intercompany debt, and other jurisdictions where we operate, including Australia and New Zealand, may doso as well in the near future;      Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;     Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs;  15 Table of Contents   Lost business or other financial harm due to governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency, including protectionist policiesthat discriminate in favor of local competitors; and      Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S. The foreign and international trade policies of the current U.S. presidential administration could develop in ways that exacerbate the risks describedabove, or introduce new risks for our international operations. If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  A substantial portion of our business is located outside the U.S. Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We mustalso translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significantchanges in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. In the U.K., Brexit has and may continue to result in substantial volatility in foreign exchange markets and may lead to a sustained weakness in the British poundsexchange rate against the U.S. dollar. Any significant weakening of the British pound to the U.S. dollar will have an adverse impact on our brokerage and risk management segment revenues and earnings as reported in U.S. dollars. We face a variety of risks in our risk management third-party claims administration operations that are distinct from those we face in our insurancebrokerage and benefit consulting operations.  Our third party claims administration operations face a variety of risks distinct from thosefaced by our brokerage operations, including the risks that:      The favorable trend among both underwriting enterprises and self-insured entities toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and riskmanagement services will reverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline;      Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due tochanges in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients, or for other reasons;      Contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints orother developments;      We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments (including those relatingto security and data privacy outside the U.S.) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;      Economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a reduction in the number of claims we process;     If we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existingcontracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);      We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain clients if we fail tomake adequate improvements in technology or operations; and      Underwriting enterprises or certain large self-insured entities may create in-house servicing capabilities thatcompete with our third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products.  If any ofthese risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Sustained increases in the cost ofemployee benefits could reduce our profitability.  The cost of current employees medical and other benefits, as well as pensionretirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. In the past, we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economicfactors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates and actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and related liabilities. A significant decreasein the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets, changes to actuarial assumptions used to determine pension plan liabilities, or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans liabilities could cause an increase inpension plan costs in future years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce ourprofitability.   16 Table of ContentsBusiness disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations, damage our reputation andimpact client relationships.  Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supportsour business. Such a disruption could be caused by human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage,intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, or war. Our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensateus for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us.  For example, our third partyclaims administration operation is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of RISX-FACS®,our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services. A disruption affecting RISX-FACS® or any other infrastructure supporting our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cause reputational harm and damage our clientrelationships.  Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks  A cybersecurity attack could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation.  We rely on information technology and third party vendors to support our business activities. Cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, phishing attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, socialengineering, physical breaches or other actions. We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents, which to datehave not had a material impact on our business. In the future, any material breaches of cybersecurity, or media reports of the same, even if untrue, could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of clients and revenue, loss of proprietarydata, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard clients information or financial losses. Such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered throughinsurance we maintain.  We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, policies and resources and employeetraining. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase. As these threats evolve, cybersecurity incidents will bemore difficult to detect, defend against and remediate. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation.  Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could have an adverse effect on our business oroperations.  We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, our employees and our clients. Thisinformation includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, financial information and intellectual property. If our information systems or infrastructure or those of our third party vendors experience a significantdisruption or breach, such information could be compromised. A party that obtains this information may use it to steal funds, for ransom, to facilitate a fraud, or for other illicit purposes. Such a disruption or breach could also result inunauthorized access to our proprietary information, intellectual property and business secrets.  We maintain policies, procedures andtechnical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance. It is possible that our security controls and employeetraining may not be effective. This could harm our reputation, create legal exposure, or subject us to legal liability.  Significant costs areinvolved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure. If we are unable to effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costsand certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.  With respect to our commercial arrangements with third partyvendors, we have processes designed to require third party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietaryinformation. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendors employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendors data protection processes,or a cyber attack on a vendors information systems.   17 Table of ContentsChanges in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, particularly in Europe, or any failure tocomply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results.  We are subject to a variety ofcontinuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data.Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. These laws apply to transfers of information among ouraffiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third party vendors. For example, the European Union adopted a comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) in May 2016 that will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive andrelated country-specific legislation. The GDPR will become fully effective in May 2018, and requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection and the ability ofpersons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may resultin significant costs to our business and require us to revise certain of our business practices. In addition, legislators and regulators in the U.S. are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity rules in light of the recent broad-basedcyberattacks at a number of companies.  These and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing, implementing orsecuring our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, adding to our IT and compliance costs. In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents andprivacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance couldresult in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.  We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply withregulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable.  Many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Department of Justice(DOJ), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S., the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K., the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia and insurance regulators innearly every jurisdiction in which we operate. Our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing licensing, data privacy,wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to ouroperations in certain countries. This regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell ourproducts and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, underwriting enterprises and third parties. As our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult tomonitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization. A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition ofpenalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees.  The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including increased staffing needs, the development of new policies, procedures and internalcontrols and providing training to employees in multiple locations, adding to our cost of doing business. Many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further the complexityand cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we areaware of all necessary licenses to operate our business, that we are operating our business in a compliant manner, or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, in light of recent events associated with Brexit, we will likely face newregulatory costs and challenges. For example, our U.K. operations could lose their European Union financial services passport which provides them the license to operate across borders within the single European Union market without obtaining localregulatory approval.  Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcementpolicies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business.   18 Table of ContentsFor example, the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in thepast because of the potential for conflicts of interest. The potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similar transactions. The vast majority of the compensation we receivefor our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees. We receive additional revenue from underwriting enterprises, separate from retail commissions and fees, including, among other things, contingent and supplementalrevenues and payments for consulting and analytics services we provide them. Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these amounts. Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage and harm our relationships with clients, underwriting enterprises or other business partners. We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseasoperations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws, sanctioned parties restrictions, and FATCA.  In foreigncountries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act. Such anti-corruption lawsgenerally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls. Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devotesubstantial resources to programs to ensure compliance. However, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with therequirements of anti-corruption laws. In addition, in recent years, two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.S. and the U.K. for improper payments to foreign officials. These firms undertook internalinvestigations and paid significant settlements.  We remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engagein business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations. Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminalpenalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm.  We may also be subject to legal liability andreputational damage if we violate U.S. trade sanctions administered by OFAC, the European Union and the United Nations, and trade sanction laws such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. In addition, FATCA requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation from payees prior to remittingcertain payments to such payees. In the event we do not obtain valid FATCA documents, we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments. This obligation is shared with our clients who may fail to comply, in whole or in part. In suchcircumstances, we may incur FATCA compliance costs including withholding taxes, interest and penalties. In addition, regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under FATCA may increase our costs of operations, andcould adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfarebenefits to their employees, and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies. Initiatives by the current presidential administration to change certain aspects of this legislation, including repeal of theindividual mandate and further delay of the Cadillac Tax, may increase such complexity. Many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the 2010 Health CareReform Legislation. We have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation. Depending on future changes to health legislation, these investments maynot yield returns. In addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employee benefitsconsulting business, will be negatively impacted. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this or any other law, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.   19 Table of ContentsWe are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us,would adversely affect our financial results.  We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise inthe ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procurecoverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide underwriting enterprises with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or provide clients with appropriate consulting, advisory and claims handling services. Thereis the risk that our employees or sub-agents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. Certain of our benefits and retirement consultants provide investmentadvice or decision-making services to clients. If these clients experience investment losses, our reputation could be damaged and our financial results could be negatively affected as a result of claims asserted against us and lost business. We haveestablished provisions against these matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments. The damages claimed in such mattersare or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or other extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materiallyadversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience anincrease in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, whenapplicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant. As more fully described in Note 15 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements, we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to ourbusiness, including but not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties,intellectual property infringement and related causes of action. We are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business. For example, our micro-captiveadvisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the IRS. In addition, we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we, our subsidiary, Gallagher Clean Energy, LLC, and Chem-Mod LLC are liablefor infringement of a patent held by Nalco Company. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly orannual period, or on an ongoing basis. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, any such matter could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel andmanagement resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. The recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may have an adverse effect on us, and such effect may be material. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly revises the U.S. taxcode by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%; limiting the deductibility of interest expense; implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreignsubsidiaries. Many aspects of the Tax Act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time. As a result, we have not yet been able to determine the full impact of the new laws on our business, operating results and financial condition. It ispossible that the Tax Act, or interpretations under it, could have an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.  Changes inour accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.  We prepare our financialstatements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and thedisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. Weperiodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments (including our IRC Section 45 investments), income taxes, stock-based compensation, claimshandling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from theseestimates. Further, as guidance relating to the recently enacted Tax Act is released, our provisional estimates related to the Tax Act may change. Additionally, changes in accounting standards (such as the new revenue recognition standard and a newstandard for leases  see Note 2 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements) could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.   20 Table of ContentsRisks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common Stock Our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  We have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under IRC Section 45.  See Note 13 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments. Our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offs in connection with these investments is subjectto various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties set forth below.      Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends uponthe operations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. These include, among others, the emissions reduction, qualifying technology, placed-in-service and coal sales to unrelated parties requirements of IRC Section 45, as well as the requirement that at least one of the operations owners qualifies as aproducer of refined coal. While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have notcontinued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.      Value of the tax credits and the tax benefits of operating costs. The timing of our utilization of the tax credits will be impacted by changesto the tax code recently enacted, but their overall gross value to us will not be impacted. Although we will pay less in taxes overall, the lower corporate tax rate will reduce the tax benefit of operating costs associated with the production ofrefined coal.      Co-investor tax credit risks. We have co-investors in several ofthe operations currently producing refined coal, and are working to negotiate arrangements with potential co-investors for the purchase of equity stakes in other operations. If no satisfactory arrangements canbe reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could have difficulty finding replacements in a timelymanner. On June 15, 2017, one of the refined coal partnerships in which we are an investor, received a notice from the IRS disallowing our co-investors from claiming tax credits. The position taken by theIRS has the potential to affect, and the IRS has opened audits of, other partnerships in which these co-investors are invested. However, the IRS notice does not challenge the validity of the tax creditsthemselves, or our ability to utilize tax credits. The partnership affected by the June 15, 2017 notice will defend its position in tax court. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimatedisposition of this proceeding. An adverse ruling would likely make it more difficult for us to reach satisfactory arrangements with new co-investors and we may also be subject to claims against us from the co-investors affected by this IRS notice.      Operational risks. Chem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies (The Chem-ModTM Solution)require chemicals that may not be readily available in the marketplace at reasonable costs. Utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers,disruptions in the supply or transportation of coal, revocation of their Chem-Mod technologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of whichcould halt or impede the operations. Long-term operations using Chem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies could also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short- ormedium-term. A serious injury or death of a worker connected with the production of refined coal using Chem-Mods technologies could expose the operations to material liabilities, jeopardizing ourinvestment, and could lead to reputational harm. In the event of any such operational problems, we may not be able to take full advantage of the tax credits. We could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if futuredevelopments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, causes our interests and those of our co-investors to diverge. Finally, our partners responsible for operationand management could fail to run the operations in compliance with IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, our investment returns may be negatively impacted.     Market demand for coal. When the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn naturalgas or oil instead of coal. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown or mild weather and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. Sustained low natural gas prices could also cause utilities to phase outor close existing coal-fired power plants. If utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, the availability of the tax credits would also be reduced.     Environmental concerns regarding coal. Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardousnature of coal combustion waste could lead to public pressure to reduce, or regulations that discourage, the burning of coal. For example, regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power fromrenewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal.   21 Table of Contents   Demand for commercial refined coal plants. The implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permittingrequirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the Environmental Protection Agency could negatively impact power generational facilitiesdemand for commercial refined coal plants, should we need to move them as described below.      Incompatible coal. If utilities purchase coal of a quality or type incompatible with their boilers and operations, treating such coal through acommercial refined coal plant could magnify the negative impacts of burning such coal. As a result, refined coal plants at such utilities may be removed from production until the incompatible coal has all been burned, which could cause us to beunable to take full advantage of the tax credits.      Moving a commercial refined coal plant. Changes in circumstances, such as those described above, may cause a commercial refined coal plant to bemoved to a different power generation facility, which could require us to invest additional capital. Three plants do not currently have long-term production contracts, of which two are 2019 Era Plants and will likely never be re-deployed. The remaining 2011 Era Plant would need to be moved once negotiations for such a contract is finalized. In addition, if for any reason one or more of these operations are unable to satisfyregulatory permitting requirements, and the utilities at which they are installed are unable to timely obtain long-term permits, we may not be able to generate additional earnings from these operations.     Intellectual property risks. There is a risk that foreign laws will not protect the intellectual property associated with The Chem-Mod Solution to the same extent as U.S. laws, leaving us vulnerable to companies outside the U.S. who may attempt to copy such intellectual property. In addition, other companies may make claims ofintellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod Solution. Such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod (orus and our investment and operational partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable on favorable terms, if at all. In July 2014, we were named in a lawsuit that asserts that we and other defendantsare liable for infringement of a patent held by Nalco Company. The complaint sought a judgment of infringement, damages, costs and attorneys fees, and injunctive relief. Along with other defendants, we disputed the allegation of infringementand have defended this matter vigorously. We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on behalf of all defendants, alleging no infringement of Nalcos intellectual property. This motion and similar motions attacking amended complaints filed byNalco, were granted. On April 20, 2016 the court dismissed Nalcos complaints and disallowed any further opportunity to amend or refile. Nalco appealed this ruling to the Federal Circuit Court and we are expecting a ruling during the firstquarter of 2018. We continue to believe that the probability of a material loss is remote. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate disposition of this proceeding. If Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) cannot defeat or defend this or other such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, the operations may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod Solution.      Strategic alternatives risk. While we currently expect to continue to hold at least a portion of these refined coal investments, if for anyreason in the future we decide to sell more of our interests, the discount rate on future cash flows could be excessive, and could result in an impairment on our investment.     IRC Section 45 phase out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase out provisions based upon the market price of coal,such that, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.  The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claimsand environmental compliance costs.  The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to Federal, state andlocal laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or theutilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. There are costs associated with ensuring compliance with all applicable laws andregulations, and failure to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability. Failure of The Chem-Mod Solution utilized at coal-firedgeneration facilities, for example, could result in violations of air emissions permits, which could lead to the imposition of penalties or other liability. Additionally, some environmental laws, without regard to fault or the legality of apartys conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise responsible for, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. One party may, under certain circumstances, berequired to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem-ModSolution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being held liable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such riskremains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with TheChem-Mod Solution. In addition, we and our partners could face the risk of environmental and product liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual   22 Table of Contentsarrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators, or other end users, will result in that facility owner or operator, or other end user,accepting full responsibility for any environmental or product liability claim. Nor can we or our partners be certain that facility owners or operators, or other end users, will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and this couldresult in environmental or product liability claims. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, nuisance, diminution of property value, or similarclaims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not providesufficient coverage in the event of an environmental or product liability claim, and defense of such claims can be costly, even when such defense prevails. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental or product liability claims, or ifthe costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We have historically benefited from IRC Section 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRCSection 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits related toour synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest. We understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication fromthe IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them. However, while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to besubject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29 tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax auditsand related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that couldsignificantly impact our ability to operate our business.  As of December 31, 2017, we had total consolidated debt outstanding ofapproximately $3.0 billion. The level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility. We also bear risk at the time our debt matures. Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debtobligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatoryand other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates. It will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, capitalexpenditures, share repurchases, and general corporate purposes. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategicacquisitions, and investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, ifnecessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions orsimilar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments, and require us to comply with certain financial covenants. The restrictions in the agreements governing our debtmay prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are notsimilarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make anyassurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. A failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under thefinancing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause ourobligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   23 Table of ContentsWe are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions inneeded amounts from our subsidiaries.  We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operatingsubsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debtobligations, for paying dividends to stockholders, repurchasing our common stock and for corporate expenses. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to us, we may not be able to service ourdebt, pay our obligations, pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock.  Further, we derive a significant portion of our revenue andoperating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operatingsubsidiaries located outside the U.S. in the event we are unable to meet these U.S. based cash requirements.  Funds from our operatingsubsidiaries outside the U.S. may be repatriated to the U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings, where necessary. A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation costprohibitive, including, but not limited to the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the imposition ofwithholding and other taxes on such payments and our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner.  In the event we are unable to generate or repatriate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate and our ability to finance ourobligations, including to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock, could be adversely affected.  Future sales or other dilution ofour equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions.One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could besubstantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, performance stock units, options or warrants to purchase our shares of our common stock in the future and those options or warrantsare exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest, our stockholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of anyoffering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or theperception that such sales could occur.  The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for youto resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.  The trading price of our common stock mayfluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, including the risk factors described above, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect themarket prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:     General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism;     Quarterly variations in our operating results;      Seasonality of our business cycle;      Changes in the markets expectations about our operating results;     Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;     Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the insurance brokerage or financial services industries ingeneral;      Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;     News reports relating to trends in our markets, including any expectations regarding an upcoming hard or soft market;     Cyber attacks and other cybersecurity incidents;      Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;     Material announcements by us or our competitors;   24 Table of Contents   The impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our investments, including the possible perception by securities analysts or investors thatsuch investments divert management attention from our core operations;      Market volatility;      A negative market reaction to announced acquisitions;     Competitive pressures in each of our segments;      General conditions in the insurance brokerage and insurance industries;     Legal proceedings or regulatory investigations;      Regulatory requirements, including international sanctions and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 or otheranti-corruption laws;      Quarter-to-quarter volatility in the earnings impact of IRCSection 45 tax credits from our clean energy investments, due to the application of accounting standards applicable to the recognition of tax credits; and     Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales couldoccur.  Stockholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price.Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of managements attention and resources"
6,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2016-02-10,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Risks Relating to our Business Generally An overall economic downturn, as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate, could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.  An overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as aresult of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. Such reductions could also adversely impactfuture commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. We record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and, as a result, anyimprovement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. Our growing operations in countries and regions undergoing economic downturns, particularly in emerging markets, expose us to risks anduncertainties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration inthe economy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Economic conditions that result infinancial difficulties for insurance companies or reduced insurer capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financialdifficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. The failure of an insurer with whom we place business couldresult in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients, and the failure of errors and omissions insurance carriers could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable, which could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition. In addition, if carriers merge or if a large carrier fails or withdraws from offering certain lines of coverage, overall underwriting capacity could be negatively affected, which could reduce ourability to place certain lines of coverage and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability.  Volatility or declines in premiums orother adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.  We derive much of our revenue from commissionsand fees for our brokerage services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. Because of marketcycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to furtherminimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Becausewe do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for futureacquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations. In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among otherthings, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While, historically, we have been able to participate in certain of theseactivities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities. Our ability togenerate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates. This could negatively impact us because fees are generally notindexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation.   10 We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses. The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations actively compete with us in oneor more areas of our business around the world. We compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets, two of which have revenues significantly larger than ours. The third firm, Willis Group Holdings Ltd., recentlycompleted a merger with a large benefits and human resources firm, and the new combined firm is significantly larger than we are. In addition, various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, regionor locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. Our risk management operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well asdivisions of larger firms.  The primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are thequality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business. In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:     Increased capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lowerinsurance premiums and commissions;      Insurance companies selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;     Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments;     Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas orother alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers; and      Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offeringrisk management or insurance brokerage services.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industrydevelopments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefits consulting firms and risk management firms. We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future andthere are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.  Our acquisitionprogram has been an important part of our historical growth, particularly in our brokerage segment, and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identifyand complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth. Continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equity-backed consolidatorscould make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive. Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions, be able to executetransactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions. When regulatory approval of acquisitions is required, our ability to complete acquisitionsmay be limited by an ongoing regulatory review or other issues with the relevant regulator. Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically. Post-acquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar markets or lines ofbusiness, contingencies or liabilities, such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accountingissues, the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business, and integration difficulties relating to accounting, information technology, human resources, or organizational culture and fit, some or all ofwhich could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth. The failure of acquisition targets to achieve anticipated revenue and earnings levels could also result in goodwill impairment charges. We own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as Jiang Tai Re, our joint venture with Jiang Tai Insurance Brokers in China,or Casanueva Perez S.A.P. de C.V. (Grupo CP) in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full integration.   11 Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualifiedpersonnel.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain both new talent and experienced personnel, includingour senior management, brokers and other key personnel. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intensecompetition for the services of leading brokers, and we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers to competitors in the past. Such departures could lead to the loss of clients and intellectual property. The loss of our chief executive officer orany of our other senior managers, brokers or other key personnel (including the key personnel that manage our interests in our IRC Section 45 investments), or our inability to identify, recruit and retain highly skilled personnel, couldmaterially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Our growing operations outside the U.S. expose usto risks different than those we face in the U.S.  We conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the U.S., including in countrieswhere the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the U.S. and more stable countries. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditionsmay temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries or create difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. For example, we have operations in India to provide certain back-office services. To date, the disputebetween India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect our operations therein the future. Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S. These include, among others, risks relating to:     Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties,environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad. These and other international regulatory risks are described below under Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks;     The potential costs, difficulties and risks associated with local regulations across the globe, including the risk of personal liability for directorsand officers and piercing the corporate veil risks under the corporate law regimes of certain countries;      Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;     Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after they are no longer employed withus, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;      Political and economic instability, particularly in emerging markets (including risks relating to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstablegovernments, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);      Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during times of crisis management;     Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;     Unfavorable audits and exposure to additional liabilities relating to various non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth,property and goods and services taxes) in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, discriminatory or confiscatory taxation, changes in the valuation of our deferred taxassets or liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretation and the financial results of our international subsidiaries. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Sharing Projectand is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business;     Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;     Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs;     Lost business or other financial harm due to governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency, including protectionist policieson the part of local governments that discriminate in favor of local competitors; and      Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S. If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.   12 We face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in ourbrokerage operations.  Our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations,including the risks that:      The favorable trend among both insurers and insureds toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services willreverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline;      Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due tochanges in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients, or for other reasons;      Contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints orother developments;      We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments (including unanticipatedregulatory developments relating to security and data privacy outside the U.S.) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;     Continued economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims we process;     If we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existingcontracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);      We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain clients if we fail tomake adequate improvements in technology or operations; and      Insurance companies or certain insurance consumers may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration andother administration, servicing and risk management products.  If any of these risks materialize, our results of operationsand financial condition could be adversely affected.  Contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are lesspredictable than standard commissions, and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations.  A portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies. Contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability,volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria. If, due tothe current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet insurance companies profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have nocontrol), actual contingent commissions and/or supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability.  Thecost of current employees medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. In the past, we have occasionallyexperienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculatepension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs infuture years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability. If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internalefficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees thatanticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely andcost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer newtechnologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth and complianceprograms.   13 Our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster, cybersecurity attack or otherdisruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Our ability to conductbusiness may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. For example, our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued andefficient functioning of RISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients withinsurance claim settlement and administration services. Disruptions could be caused by, among other things, restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, cybersecurity attacks, or outages to electrical, communications orother services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. We have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies. However, such procedures may not beeffective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against usbecause of any period during which we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reputation is a key asset of the Company. We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attractand retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these or othermatters, including our association with clients or business partners who themselves have a damaged reputation, or from actual or alleged conduct by us or our employees, could damage our reputation. Any resulting erosion of trust and confidence amongexisting and potential clients, regulators, stockholders and other parties important to the success of our business could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.  Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data, whether due to human error, misuse of information by employees or vendors, or as aresult of cyberattacks, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations.  We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, our employees and our clients. This information includes personally identifiable information, protected healthinformation and financial information. In many jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S. and the European Union, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of this information. These lawsapply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third-party vendors.  We have from timeto time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. In the future, thesetypes of incidents could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data, compromise confidential business information, result inintellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client, employee or company data, which could harm our competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business. Cyber threats are constantly evolving,which makes it more difficult to detect cybersecurity incidents, assess their severity or impact in a timely manner, and successfully defend against them.  We maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk ofhuman error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance. It is possible that the steps we follow, including our security controls over personal data and training of employees on data security, may not prevent improper access to,disclosure of, or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information. This could cause harm to our reputation, create legal exposure, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss ofrevenue.  Significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure. If we are unable to effectivelymaintain and upgrade our system safeguards, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. With respect to our commercial arrangements with third-party vendors, we have processes designed to require third-party IT outsourcing, offsite storageand other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentionalnon-compliance by a vendors employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendors data protection processes, or a cyber attack on a vendors information systems.   14 Data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws, rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions andcountries in which we operate. For example, in 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated a key safe harbor relied upon by many businesses to transfer personal data legally from the European Union to the U.S. There is a growing body ofinternational data protection law, which, in part, includes security breach notification obligations, more stringent operational requirements and significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, legislators in the U.S. are proposing new andmore robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. These and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing, implementing or securing our servers and require usto allocate more resources to improved technologies, adding to our IT and compliance costs. Our failure to adhere to, or successfully implement processes in response to, changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legalliability or damage to our reputation in the marketplace.  We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatoryrequirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable.  Many of our activities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Department of Justice(DOJ), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S., the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K., the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia and insurance regulators innearly every jurisdiction in which we operate. Our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressing licensing, data privacy, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition,anti-corruption, currency, reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This regulatory supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, restricting theproducts or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers and third parties. As ouroperations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization. A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions thatmay include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees. The global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including the development of new internalcontrols and providing training to employees in multiple locations, adding to our cost of doing business. In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further thecomplexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurancethat we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business, that we are operating our business in a compliant manner, or that our rights are otherwise protected.  Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lostrevenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business.  For example, the method by which insurance brokers are compensatedhas received substantial scrutiny in the past fifteen years because of the potential for conflicts of interest. The potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the same or similartransactions. The vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees. We receive additional revenue from insurance companies, separate from retail commissions and fees,including, among other things, contingent and supplemental commissions and payments for consulting and analytics services provided to insurance carriers. Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect these additionalrevenue streams. Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputational damage andharm our client, insurer or other relationships.  We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that imposerequirements for the conduct of our overseas operations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws, sanctioned parties restrictions, and FATCA.  In foreign countries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPAand the U.K. Bribery Act. Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls. Our policiesmandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to our compliance program to ensure compliance. However, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances,local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws. In addition, in recent years, two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.S. and the U.K. for improperpayments to foreign officials. These firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements.   15 We remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in businesspractices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations. Violations by our company or a third party could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, includingprohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm.  We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if weviolate U.S. trade sanctions administered by OFAC, the European Union and the United Nations, and trade sanction laws such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012.  In addition, FATCA requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation from payees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees. In the event wedo not obtain valid FATCA documents, we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments. This obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail to comply, in whole or in part. In such circumstances, we may incur FATCA compliancecosts including withholding taxes, interest and penalties. In addition, regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under FATCA may increase our costs of operations, and could adversely affect the market for ourservices as intermediaries, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could benegatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation.  The 2010Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees, and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various governmentagencies. Many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. We have made significant investments in product and knowledgedevelopment to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation. Depending on future changes to health legislation, these investments may not yield returns. In addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changesresulting from this law and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employee benefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. In addition, if our clients reduce therole or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this or any other law, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financialresults.  We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Suchclaims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies withcomplete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or provide clients with appropriate consulting, advisory and claims handling services. There is also the risk that our employees or sub-agents may fail to appropriately applyfunds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. We have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to timebased on current material developments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or other extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of thesecontingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future,our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arisein such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time ascurrent developments warrant.  As more fully described in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, we are a defendant in variouslegal actions incidental to our business, including but not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of non-compete or other restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectualproperty infringement and related causes of action. We are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxing authorities into various matters related to our business. For example, our micro-captive advisoryservices are currently the subject of an investigation by the IRS. In addition, we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we, our subsidiary, Gallagher Clean Energy, LLC, and Chem-Mod LLC are liable for infringement of a patent held by NalcoCompany. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period, or on an ongoing basis. Inaddition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, any such matter could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adverselyaffect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.   16 Significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. A large and growing portion of our business is located outside the U.S. Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incurobligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currentlyhave some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptionsthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amountsof revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments (including our IRC Section 45investments), income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based onspecific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards (for example, new standards relating to revenue recognition and leases) could increase costs to the organization and could havean adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.  Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common Stock Our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under IRC Section 45. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments. Our ability to generate returns and avoidwrite-offs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties set forth below.     Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon theoperations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. These include, among others, the emissions reduction, qualifying technology, and placed-in-service requirements ofIRC Section 45, as well as the requirement that at least one of the operations owners qualifies as a producer of refined coal. While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claimthese tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. Additionally, Congress could modify or repeal IRC Section 45 andremove the tax credits retroactively.      Business risks. We are working to negotiate arrangements with potential co-investors for the purchase of equity stakes in one or more of theoperations currently producing refined coal. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could have difficulty finding replacements in atimely manner. We could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, causes our interests and those of ourco-investors to diverge. Finally, our partners responsible for operation and management could fail to run the operations in compliance with IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, our investment returns may be negatively impacted.     Operational risks. Chem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies (TheChem-ModTM Solution) require chemicals that may not bereadily available in the marketplace at reasonable costs. Utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers, disruptions in the supply ortransportation of coal, revocation of their Chem-Mod technologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operations. Long-term operations usingChem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies could also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short- or medium-term. A serious injury or death of a worker connected with the production of refined coal usingChem-Mods technologies could expose the operations to material liabilities, jeopardizing our investment, and could lead to reputational harm. In the event of any such operational problems, we may not be able to take full advantage of the taxcredits.      Market demand for coal. When the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn naturalgas or oil instead of coal. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown or mild weather and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. Sustained low natural gas prices may also cause utilities to phase out orclose existing coal-fired power plants. If utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, the availability of the tax credits would also be reduced.   17    Incompatible coal. If utilities purchase coal of a quality or type incompatible with their boilers and operations, treating such coal through acommercial refined coal plant could magnify the negative impacts of burning such coal. As a result, refined coal plants at such utilities may be removed from production until the incompatible coal has all been burned, which could cause us to beunable to take full advantage of the tax credits.      IRC Section 45 phase out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase out provisions based upon the market price of coal, such that, ifthe price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.      Environmental concerns regarding coal. Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardousnature of coal combustion waste could lead to public pressure to reduce, or regulations that discourage, the burning of coal. For example, regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power fromrenewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal.      Moving a commercial refined coal plant. Changes in circumstances, such as those described above, may cause a commercial refined coal plant to bemoved to a different power generation facility, which could require us to invest additional capital. Five plants do not currently have long-term production contracts, and may have to be moved once negotiations for such contracts are finalized. Inaddition, if for any reason one or more of these operations are unable to satisfy regulatory permitting requirements and the utilities at which they are installed are unable to timely obtain long-term permits, we may not be able to generateadditional earnings from these operations.      Demand for commercial refined coal plants. The implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permittingrequirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the Environmental Protection Agency could negatively impact power generational facilitiesdemand for commercial refined coal plants, should we need to move them as described above.      Intellectual property risks. There is a risk that foreign laws will not protect the intellectual property associated with The Chem-ModSolution to the same extent as U.S. laws, leaving us vulnerable to companies outside the U.S. who may attempt to copy such intellectual property. In addition, other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to TheChem-Mod Solution. Such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod (or us and our investment and operational partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable onfavorable terms, if at all. In July 2014, we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we and other defendants are liable for infringement of a patent held by Nalco Company. Since the filing of the lawsuit, we have twice filed motions to dismisson behalf of all defendants, alleging no infringement of Nalcos intellectual property, and each time the court has granted our motion but has given Nalco Company leave to replead its complaint. Nalco filed its most recent amended complaint inNovember 2015 and we again moved to dismiss, alleging no infringement of Nalcos intellectual property. The court is currently scheduled to rule on this motion on April 20, 2016. Although we believe that the probability of a material lossis remote, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of this proceeding. If Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) cannot defeat or defend this or other such claims or obtainnecessary licenses on reasonable terms, the operations may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod Solution.      Strategic alternatives risk. While we currently expect to continue to hold at least a portion of these refined coal investments, if for anyreason in the future we decide to sell more of our interests, the discount rate on future cash flows could be excessive, and could result in an impairment on our investment.  The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations andpotential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which theoperations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Failure of The Chem-Mod Solution utilized at coal-fired generation facilities, for example, could resultin violations of air emissions permits. Additionally, some environmental laws, without regard to fault or the legality of a partys conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise responsible for, therelease or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments orparticipation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem-Mod Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of being heldliable for environmental damage from releases of hazardous substances we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to thetypes of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod Solution. For example, we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ashproduced using The Chem-Mod Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and   18 precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. Itis also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorizecitizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmentalclaim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We have historically benefited from IRC Section 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. The disallowanceof IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax creditsrelated to our synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previouslyobtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest. We understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the IRS that it willseek to revoke or modify them. However, while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability underindemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29 tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnificationcontingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility and subjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. As of December 31, 2015, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.5 billion. The level of debt outstandingeach period could adversely affect our financial flexibility. We also bear risk at the time debt matures. Our ability to make interest and principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capitalexpenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as anenvironment of rising interest rates. It will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to stockholders, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and general corporate purposes.If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments, any of which could impede the implementationof our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may not be ableto refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that,among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens onassets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments. The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our businessand our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us toadditional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing onterms acceptable to us, or at all. A failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure tocomply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect onour financial condition and results of operations.  We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or otherdistributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.  We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct fromour operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstandingdebt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to the Company, we may not be able to service our debt, pay ourobligations or pay dividends on our common stock.   19 Further, we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiarieslocated outside the U.S. Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S in theevent we are unable to meet these U.S. based cash requirements.  Funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. may be repatriated tothe U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings, where necessary. A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to, foreignexchange rates and tax-related costs.  In the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasonsdiscussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate.  Future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the marketprice of our common stock.  We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies orotherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of ourcommon stock. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, performance stock units, stock appreciation rights, options or warrants to purchase our shares of our common stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights,options, or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units or performance stock units vest, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their prorata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of ourcommon stock or the perception that such sales could occur.  The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may makeit difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.  The trading price of ourcommon stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, including the risk factors described above, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumesthat affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock priceare:      General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism;     Quarterly variations in our operating results;      Seasonality of our business cycle;      Changes in the markets expectations about our operating results;     Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;     Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the insurance brokerage or financial services industries ingeneral;      Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;     News reports relating to trends in our markets, including any expectations regarding an upcoming hard or soft market;     Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;     Material announcements by us or our competitors;      The impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our investments, including the possible perception by securities analysts or investors thatsuch investments divert management attention from our core operations;      Market volatility;      A negative market reaction to announced acquisitions;     Competitive pressures in each of our segments;      General conditions in the insurance brokerage and insurance industries;     Legal proceedings;      Regulatory requirements, including international sanctions and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 or otheranti-corruption laws;      Quarter-to-quarter volatility in the earnings impact of IRC Section 45 tax credits from our clean energy investments, due to the application ofaccounting standards applicable to the recognition of tax credits; and      Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales couldoccur.   20 Shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stockprice. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of managements attention and resources"
10,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2015-02-13,">Item 1A. RiskFactors.  Risks Relating to our Business Generally  An overall economic downturn, as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. An overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount ofinsurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. Such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriersperform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. We record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and, as a result, any improvement in our results of operations andfinancial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. In addition, some of our clients may experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which could have an adverseeffect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Our growing operations in countries and regions undergoing economic downturns,particularly in emerging markets, expose us to risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the market instability caused by the Eurozone debt crisis has led toquestions regarding the future viability of the Euro as a single currency for the region. The exit of Greece or another country from the Eurozone, or the dissolution of the Euro (in the extreme case), could lead to further contraction in theEurozone economies, adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, the value of our assets held in the Eurozone, including cash holdings, would decline if currencies in the region were devalued. Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for insurance companies or reduced insurer capacity could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.  We have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies withwhich we place insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidatedfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our clients, overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which couldreduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability. The failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients, andthe failure of errors and omissions insurance carriers could make the errors and omissions insurance we rely upon cost prohibitive or unavailable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability. We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissionsare generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. Because of market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues andprofitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.   9 Table of ContentsAs traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue tonon-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with generalvolatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they willsignificantly decline. As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases inpremium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.  In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in theinsurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance.While, historically, we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as thoserealized from our traditional brokerage activities. Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commissionrates. This could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation.  We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.  The insurancebrokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations, as well as individuals, actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world. We compete with three firms in theglobal risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours. In addition, various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in thatcountry, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. Our risk management operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms. We believe that the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of theservices rendered and the overall costs to our clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business. In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:     Increased capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lowerinsurance premiums and commissions;      Insurance companies selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;     Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments;     Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas orother alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers; and      Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms, consulting firms and Internet or other technology firms offeringrisk management or insurance brokerage services.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industrydevelopments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefits consulting firms and risk management firms. We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future andthere are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.  Historically, wehave acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefits consulting firms and risk management firms. Our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important tomaintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth. Continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokerson the part of private equity firms and private equity-backed consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive. Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, wemay not be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions. Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may alsodecrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically.  Post-acquisition risks include those relating toretention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business, contingencies or liabilities, such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and U.K.Bribery Act, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accounting issues, the risk that the acquisition distracts management and personnel from our existing business, and integration difficultiesrelating to accounting, information technology, human resources, or organizational culture and fit, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth. Post-acquisition deterioration of targets could alsoresult in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or goodwill impairment charges.   10 Table of ContentsWe own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as Jiang Tai Re, our jointventure with Jiang Tai Insurance Brokers in China, or Casanueva Perez S.A.P. de C.V. (Grupo CP) in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could beachieved through full integration.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualifiedpersonnel.  We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including oursenior management, brokers and other key personnel. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intensecompetition for the services of leading brokers, and we have lost key brokers and groups of brokers to competitors in the past; for example, the leader of our brokerage operations in the U.K., as well as the finance leader of those operations,recently left us. The loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers, brokers or other key personnel (including the key personnel that manage our interests in our IRC Section 45 investments), or our inability toidentify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our growing operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S. We conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the U.S., including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relativelygreater than that present in the U.S. and more stable countries. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in thesecountries or create difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. For example, we have operations in India to provide certain back-office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidentsof terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future. Should our access to these services be disrupted,our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risksthat are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S. These include, among others, risks relating to:      Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties,environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad. These include rules enforced by the Internal Revenue Service (for example, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of theHiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, which we refer to as FATCA), rules issued by the SEC, rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Union and the United Nations, trade sanctionlaws such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, the requirements of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate (such as the U.K. Bribery Act), as well asunexpected changes in such regulatory requirements and laws;      The potential costs, difficulties and risks associated with local regulations across the globe, including the risk of personal liability for directorsand officers and piercing the corporate veil risks under the corporate law regimes of certain countries;      Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;     Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after they are no longer employed withus, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;      Political and economic instability, particularly in the Eurozone (including the potential dissolution of the Euro) and in emerging markets (includingundeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);      Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during times of crisis management;     Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;     Adverse changes in tax rates or discriminatory or confiscatory taxation in foreign jurisdictions;     Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;     Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs;     Lost business or other financial harm due to governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services and currency, including protectionist policieson the part of local governments that discriminate in favor of local competitors; and      Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S.   11 Table of ContentsIf any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.  We face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations. Our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations, including the risk that:     The favorable trend among both insurers and insureds toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services willreverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline;      Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due tochanges in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients, or for other reasons;      Contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints orother developments;      We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments (including unanticipatedregulatory developments relating to security and data privacy outside the U.S.) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;     Continued economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims we process;     If we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existingcontracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);      We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain clients if we fail tomake adequate improvements in technology or operations; and      Insurance companies or certain insurance consumers may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration andother administration, servicing and risk management products.  If any of these developments occur, our results of operationsand financial condition could be adversely affected.  Contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are lesspredictable than standard commissions, and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations.  A portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies. Contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability,volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria. If, due tothe current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet insurance companies profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have nocontrol), actual contingent commissions and/or supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability.  Thecost of current employees medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. In the past, we have occasionallyexperienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculatepension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs infuture years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability. If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internalefficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuingchanges in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in themarketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our   12 Table of Contentsbusiness requires us to incur significant expenses. For example, certain of our competitors have launched consulting operations that leverage global insurance placement data. If we cannot offernew technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth and complianceprograms.  Our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster, cybersecurity attack or other disruption to businesscontinuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Our ability to conduct business may be adverselyaffected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. For example, our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning ofRISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients with insurance claimsettlement and administration services. Disruptions could be caused by, among other things, restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, cybersecurity attacks, or outages to electrical, communications or other servicesused by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. We have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies. However, such procedures may not be effective and anyinsurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of any periodduring which we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our reputation is a key asset of the Company. We advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon theexternal perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damageour reputation among existing and potential clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from our association with clients or business partners who themselveshave a damaged reputation, actual or alleged conduct by us, including unethical actions by rogue brokers, operations, regulatory compliance, and the use and protection of data and systems, satisfaction of client expectations, and fromactions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. This damage to our reputation could further affect the confidence of our clients, regulators, stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important toour business, having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Regulatory, Legal andAccounting Risks  We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change ina way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable.  Many of ouractivities throughout the world are subject to regulatory supervision, including insurance industry regulation and regulations promulgated by bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Department of Justice (DOJ) and InternalRevenue Service (IRS) in the U.S., the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia. Our activities are also subject to a variety of other laws, rules and regulations addressinglicensing, data privacy, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, anti-competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This regulatorysupervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge forour services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers and third parties. As our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization. Acompliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In all suchcases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs and legal fees.  The global nature of our operations increases thecomplexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations, including the development of new internal controls and providing training to employees in multiple locations, adding to our cost of doing business. In addition, many of these laws andregulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing further the complexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulationsmay not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us with adequate assurance that we are aware of all necessary licenses to operate our business, that we are operating our business in a compliant manner, or that ourrights are otherwise protected.  Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration andenforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, we offer captive design and management services and groupcaptive development services,   13 Table of Contentsand expect to be able to continue offering such services. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has established a subgroup to study the use of captives and special purposevehicles to transfer insurance risk and make recommendations in relation to existing state laws and regulations. Any action by Federal, state or other regulators that adversely affects our ability to offer services in relation to captives, eitherretroactively or prospectively, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Additionally, the method by which insurancebrokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past decade because of the potential for conflicts of interest. The potential for conflicts of interest arises when a broker is compensated by two parties in connection with the sameor similar transactions. The vast majority of the compensation we receive for our work as insurance brokers is in the form of retail commissions and fees. We receive additional revenue from insurance companies, separate from retail commissions andfees, including, among other things, contingent and supplemental commissions and payments for consulting and analytics services provided to insurance carriers. Future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect theseadditional revenue streams. Adverse regulatory, legal or other developments regarding these revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, expose us to negative publicity and reputationaldamage and harm our client, insurer or other relationships.  We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of lawsthat impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws, sanctioned parties restrictions, and FATCA.  In foreign countries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPAand the U.K. Bribery Act. Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls. Our policiesmandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote substantial resources to our compliance program to ensure compliance. However, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances,local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws. In addition, in recent years, two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.S. and the U.K. for improperpayments to foreign officials. These firms undertook internal investigations and paid significant settlements.  We remain subject to the riskthat our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations. Violations by our company or a third party could result in significant internalinvestigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and reputational harm. We may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate U.S. trade sanctions on countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudanand Syria.  In addition, FATCA requires certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities to obtain valid FATCA documentation frompayees prior to remitting certain payments to such payees. In the event we do not obtain valid FATCA documents, we may be obliged to withhold a portion of such payments. This obligation is shared with our customers and clients who may fail tocomply, in whole or in part. In such circumstances, we may incur FATCA compliance costs including withholding taxes, interest and penalties. In addition, regulatory initiatives and changes in the regulations and guidance promulgated under FATCA mayincrease our costs of operations, and could adversely affect the market for our services as intermediaries, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfarebenefits to their employees, and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies. Many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. We have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation. Depending on future changes to health legislation, theseinvestments may not yield returns. In addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employeebenefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this or any other law, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.  14 Table of ContentsWe are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us,would adversely affect our financial results.  We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise inthe ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf ofclients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or provide clients with appropriate consulting, advisory and claims handling services. There is also the risk that our employees orsub-agents may fail to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. We have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and weadjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or other extraordinary damages. It is possiblethat, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adverselyaffected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provideprotection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals andreceivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant.  As more fully described in Note 14 to our consolidatedfinancial statements, we are a defendant in various legal actions incidental to the nature of our business and our clean energy investments, including but not limited to matters related to employment practices, alleged breaches of non-compete orother restrictive covenants, theft of trade secrets, breaches of fiduciary duties, intellectual property infringement and related causes of action. We are also periodically the subject of inquiries and investigations by regulatory and taxingauthorities into various matters related to our business. For example, our micro-captive advisory services are currently the subject of an investigation by the IRS. In addition, we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we, our subsidiary, GallagherClean Energy, LLC, and Chem-Mod LLC are liable for infringement of a patent held by Nalco Company. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations orfinancial condition in any given quarterly or annual period, or on an ongoing basis. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, any such matter could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employeerelationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional costs, loss of profit opportunities and damage to ourreputation.  We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality brokerage and riskmanagement services, so that we can understand our clients needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to their needs. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it may be more damaging to our business than to otherbusinesses and could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups and/or trade associations and actively share information amongst themselves about the qualityof service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients.  The nature of much of our work, especially our actuarial services in our benefits consulting business, involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannotknow with certainty in advance. Similarly, in our institutional investment consulting and our retirement services consulting businesses, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptibleto influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming or data entry or management errors. A client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice. In addition tothe risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums, claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure newbusiness.  Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data, whether due to human error, misuse of information byemployees or vendors, or as a result of cyberattacks, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations. We maintain confidential, personal and proprietary information relating to our company, our employees and our clients. This information includespersonally identifiable information, protected health information and financial information. In many jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S. and the European Union, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention,security and transfer of this information. These laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third-party vendors.  We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents, which to date havenot had a material impact on our business. In the future, these types of incidents could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to   15 Table of Contentsprovide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data, compromise confidential businessinformation, result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client, employee or company data, which could harm our competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business. Cyber threats areconstantly evolving, which makes it more difficult to detect them, to assess their severity or impact in a timely manner, and to successfully defend against them.  We maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the risk ofhuman error or inadequate safeguards against employee or vendor malfeasance. It is possible that the steps we follow, including our security controls over personal data and training of employees on data security, may not prevent improper access to,disclosure of, or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information. This could cause harm to our reputation, create legal exposure, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss ofrevenue.  Significant costs are involved with maintaining system safeguards for our technology infrastructure. If we are unable to effectivelymaintain and upgrade our system safeguards, including in connection with the integration of acquisitions, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. With respect to our commercial arrangements with third-party vendors, we have processes designed to require third-party IT outsourcing, offsite storageand other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentionalnon-compliance by a vendors employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendors data protection processes, or a cyber attack on a vendors information systems.  Data privacy is subject to frequently changing laws, rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate. There is a growing body of international data protection law,which, in part, includes security breach notification obligations, more stringent operational requirements and significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, legislators in the U.S. are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislationin light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies. These and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing, implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources toimproved technologies, adding to our IT and compliance costs. Our failure to adhere to, or successfully implement processes in response to, changing legal or regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage to ourreputation in the marketplace.  Significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. A large and growing portion of our business is located outside the U.S. Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incurobligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currentlyhave some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptionsthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amountsof revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments (including our IRC Section 45investments), income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based onspecific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards (for example, new standards relating to revenue recognition and leases) could increase costs to the organization and could havean adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.  Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common Stock Our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under IRC Section 45.  16 Table of ContentsSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments. Ourability to generate returns and avoid write-offs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below.     Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon theoperations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. These include, among others, the emissions reduction, qualifying technology, and placed-in-service requirements ofIRC Section 45, as well as the requirement that at least one of the operations owners qualifies as a producer of refined coal. While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claimthese tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. Additionally, Congress could modify or repeal IRC Section 45 andremove the tax credits retroactively.      Business risks. We are working to negotiate arrangements with potential co-investors for the purchase of equity stakes in one or more of theoperations currently producing refined coal. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could have difficulty finding replacements in atimely manner. We could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, causes our interests and those of ourco-investors to diverge. Finally, our partners responsible for operation and management could fail to run the operations in compliance with IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, our investment returns may be negatively impacted.     Operational risks. Chem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies (TheChem-ModTM Solution) require chemicals that may not bereadily available in the marketplace at reasonable costs. Utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers, disruptions in the supply ortransportation of coal, revocation of their Chem-Mod technologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operations. Long-term operations usingChem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies could also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short- or medium-term. A serious injury or death of a worker connected with the production of refined coal usingChem-Mods technologies could expose the operations to material liabilities, jeopardizing our investment, and could lead to reputational harm. In the event of any such operational problems, we may not be able to take full advantage of the taxcredits.      Market demand for coal. When the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn naturalgas or oil instead of coal. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. Sustained low natural gas prices may also cause utilities to phase out or close existingcoal-fired power plants. If utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, the availability of the tax credits would also be reduced.     Incompatible coal. If utilities purchase coal of a quality or type incompatible with their boilers and operations, treating such coal through acommercial refined coal plant could magnify the negative impacts of burning such coal. As a result, refined coal plants at such utilities may be removed from production until the incompatible coal has all been burned, which could cause us to beunable to take full advantage of the tax credits.      IRC Section 45 phase out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase out provisions based upon the market price of coal, such that, ifthe price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.      Environmental concerns regarding coal. Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardousnature of coal combustion waste could lead to public pressure to reduce, or regulations that discourage, the burning of coal. For example, regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power fromrenewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. In addition, if the EPA classifies fly ash (a byproduct of burning coal) as a hazardous waste, commercial users of fly ash may wish to avoid using materialidentified as such and seek alternative products. Any such development could result in utilities burning less coal, which would reduce the generation of tax credits.     Moving a commercial refined coal plant. Changes in circumstances, such as those described above, may cause a commercial refined coal plant to bemoved to a different power generation facility, which could require us to invest additional capital. Eight plants do not currently have long-term production contracts, and may have to be moved once negotiations for such contracts are finalized. Inaddition, if for any reason one or more of these operations are unable to satisfy regulatory permitting requirements and the utilities at which they are installed are unable to timely obtain long-term permits, we may not be able to generateadditional earnings from these operations.      Demand for commercial refined coal plants. The implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permittingrequirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the Environmental Protection Agency could negatively impact power generational facilitiesdemand for commercial refined coal plants, should we need to move them as described above.      Intellectual property risks. Other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod Solution.Such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable on favorable terms, if at all.In July 2014, we were named in a lawsuit asserting that we, our subsidiary,   17 Table of Contents  Gallagher Clean Energy, LLC, and Chem-Mod LLC are liable for infringement of a patent held by Nalco Company. The complaint seeks a judgment of infringement, damages, costs and attorneysfees, and injunctive relief. We and the other defendants dispute the allegations contained in the complaint and intend to defend this matter vigorously. On September 30, 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on behalf of alldefendants. On February 4, 2015, our motion to dismiss was granted by the court; however, the court also granted Nalco Company 30 days to file an amended complaint. Although we believe that the probability of a material loss is remote,litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of this proceeding. If Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) cannot defeat or defend this or other such claims or obtain necessarylicenses on reasonable terms, the operations may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod Solution.      Strategic alternatives risk. While we currently expect to continue to hold at least a portion of these refined coal investments, if for anyreason in the future we decide to sell more of our interests, the discount rate on future cash flows could be excessive, and could result in an impairment on our investment.  The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations andpotential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which theoperations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a partysconduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burningrefined coal produced using The Chem-Mod Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entireshare of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem-Mod Solution at locations owned and operated byothers, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent theenvironmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod Solution. For example, we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claimsrelated to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result inthat facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution ofproperty or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover allenvironmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental complianceincrease for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We have historically benefitedfrom IRC Section 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007and prior years is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest. We understand these private letter rulings areconsistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them. However, while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operationsunder audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29 tax credits. Foradditional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations.  We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility andsubjects us to restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.  As of December 31,2014, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.4 billion. The level of debt outstanding each period could adversely affect our financial flexibility. We also bear risk at the time debt matures. Our ability to make interestand principal payments, to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our acquisition program and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic,financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, such as an environment of rising interest rates. It will also reduce the ability to use that cash for other purposes, including working capital, dividendsto   18 Table of Contentsstockholders, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and general corporate purposes. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets,seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwisebenefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additionaldebt, prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or makeinvestments. The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our businessstrategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial andoperational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. A failure to comply with the restrictionsunder the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncuredor the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries. We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company withoutsignificant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders andfor corporate expenses. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay sufficient dividends and other payments to the Company, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. Further, we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. Since the majority offinancing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are paid from the U.S., it is important to be able to access the cash generated by our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S.  Funds from our operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. may be repatriated to the U.S. via stockholder distributions and intercompany financings, where necessary. A number of factors may arise that couldlimit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange rates and tax-related costs.  In the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate. Future sales or other dilution of our equity could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities isthrough the issuance of additional equity securities. The issuance of any additional shares of common or of preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Moreover, to the extent that weissue restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, options or warrants to purchase our shares of our common stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights, options, or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units vest, ourshareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings couldresult in increased dilution to our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you attimes or at prices you find attractive.  The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors,many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have adverselyaffected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:      General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism;     Quarterly variations in our operating results;   19 Table of Contents   Seasonality of our business cycle;      Changes in the markets expectations about our operating results;     Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;     Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the financial services industry in general;     Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;     News reports relating to trends in our markets, including any expectations regarding an upcoming hard or soft market;     Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;     Material announcements by us or our competitors;      The impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our investments, including the possible perception by securities analysts or investors thatsuch investments divert management attention from our core operations;      Market volatility;      A negative market reaction to announced acquisitions;     Competitive pressures in each of our segments;      General conditions in the insurance industry;      Legal proceedings;      Regulatory requirements, including international sanctions and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 or otheranti-corruption laws;      Quarter-to-quarter volatility in the earnings impact of IRC Section 45 tax credits from our clean energy investments, due to the application ofaccounting standards applicable to the recognition of tax credits; and      Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales couldoccur.  Shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price.Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of managements attention and resources"
4,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2014-02-07,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.  Risks Relating to our Business Generally  An economic downturn, as well as uncertaintyregarding the European debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the Euro, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  An overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in theirheadcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. Such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premiumadjustments. We record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and, as a result, any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. In addition,some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, or be acquired by other companies, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance. If those insurancecompanies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our clients, overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could reduce our placement of certain lines and typesof insurance and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability. The failure of an insurer with whom we place business could also result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients, which could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.   8 Table of ContentsDespite a recent agreement by European Union officials on a system to wind down failed banks, continuedconcerns regarding the ability of certain European countries to service their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets. A potential consequence may be stagnant growth, or even recession, in theEurozone economies and beyond, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The market instability caused by the Eurozone debt crisis has led to questions regarding the future viability of the Euro as a single currency for the region. Thedissolution of the Euro (in the extreme case) could lead to further contraction in the Eurozone economies, adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, the value of our assets held in the Eurozone, including cash holdings, woulddecline if currencies in the region were devalued.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industrymay seriously undermine our profitability.  We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerageservices. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. For example, after three years of ahard market that began in late 2000 and was strengthened by the events of September 11th, 2001, in which premium rates were stable or increasing, in late 2003 the market experienced the return of flat or reduced premium rates (a soft market) in many lines and geographic areas.This put downward pressure on our commission revenues. In 2012 and 2013, the market began firming (as opposed to traditional hardening) across many lines and geographic areas. In this environment, rates increased at amoderate pace, clients could still obtain coverage, businesses continued to stay in standard-line markets and there was adequate capacity in the market. It is not clear whether this firming is sustainable given the uncertainty of the currenteconomic environment. Because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time. As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us,those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, maysignificantly affect our profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, we may haveto adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of ouroperations.  In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance marketsincluding, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While, historically, we have been able to participate incertain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities. Ourability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates. This could negatively impact us because fees aregenerally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation.  We facesignificant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.  The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and manyinsurance brokerage and service organizations, as well as individuals, actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world. We compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenuessignificantly larger than ours. In addition, various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as orlarger than those of our corresponding local office. Our risk management operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms.  We believe that the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients. Losingbusiness to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business. In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:     Increased capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lowerinsurance premiums and commissions;      Insurance companies selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;   9 Table of Contents   Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (for example, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation);     Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas orother alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers; and      Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms and consulting firms offering risk management or insurance brokerageservices.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for ourproducts and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We havehistorically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefits consulting firms and risk management firms. We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, whichcould adversely affect our growth and results of operations.  Historically, we have acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefitsconsulting firms and risk management firms. Our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure tosuccessfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth. Continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and privateequity-backed consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive. Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not be able to execute transactions onfavorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions. Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of largeacquisitions than we have historically.  Post-acquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel, entry into unfamiliarmarkets, unanticipated contingencies or liabilities (such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act) tax and accounting issues, and integration difficulties, relating to accounting, informationtechnology, human resources, or organizational culture and fit, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth. Post-acquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earningscontribution and/or goodwill impairment charges.  We own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as CasanuevaPerez S.A.P. de C.V. (Grupo CP) in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full integration. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including our senior management, brokersand other key personnel. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services ofleading brokers, and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers, brokers or other key personnel (including the key personnel that manage our interests in our IRCSection 45 investments), or our inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Our growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S.  We conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the U.S., including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the U.S. and morestable countries. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries. For example, we have operations in India to provide certain back-office services. To date, the dispute betweenIndia and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect our operations there in thefuture. Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S.These include, among others, risks relating to:      Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties,environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad. These include rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Unionand the United Nations, trade sanction laws such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, the requirements of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate (such asthe U.K. Bribery Act), as well as unexpected changes in such regulatory requirements and laws;   10 Table of Contents   Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;     Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment, and may make itmore difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;      Political and economic instability (including the potential dissolution of the Euro, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);     Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during times of crisis management;     Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;     Adverse changes in tax rates or discriminatory or confiscatory taxation in foreign jurisdictions;     Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;     Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs; and     Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S. If any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations. Our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations, including the risk that:     The favorable trend among both insurers and insureds toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services willreverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline;      Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of changes in managementat such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients;      Contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints orother developments;      We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments (including unanticipatedregulatory developments relating to security and data privacy outside the United States) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;     Continued economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims we process;     If we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existingcontracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);      We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations;and      Insurance companies or certain insurance consumers may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration andother administration, servicing and risk management products.  If any of these developments occur, our results of operationsand financial condition could be adversely affected.  Contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are lesspredictable than standard commissions, and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations.  A portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies. Contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability,volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria. If, due tothe current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet insurance companies profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have nocontrol), actual contingent commissions and/or supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   11 Table of ContentsSustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability. The cost of current employees medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under ourlegacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. In the past, we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health carecosts, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interestrates used to discount the pension plans liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limitingfuture cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.  If we are unable to apply technologyeffectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our client relationships, growth strategy,compliance programs and operating results could be adversely affected.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop andimplement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to thesedevelopments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses.For example, certain of our competitors have launched consulting operations that leverage global insurance placement data. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effectivetechnologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships, growth strategy, compliance programs and operating results.  Our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster, material cybersecurity attack or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on ouroperations.  Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in theinfrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. For example, our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning ofRISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients with insurance claimsettlement and administration services. Disruptions could be caused by, among other things, restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, material cybersecurity attacks, or outages to electrical, communications or otherservices used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. We have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies. However, such procedures may not be effective andany insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of anyperiod during which we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects ouroperations, we may not be able to conduct our business or may be less profitable.  Many of our activities are subject to regulatorysupervision, including insurance industry regulation, Federal and state employment regulation and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) and Internal RevenueService (IRS) in the U.S., and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the U.K. Such regulations could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter,the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers and third parties. As our operations grow around the world, it is increasinglydifficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization. A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, theimposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs.  In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that couldresult in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, we offer captive design and management services and group captive development services, and expect to be able to continue offering such services. TheNational Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has established a subgroup to study the use of captives and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk in relation to existing state laws and regulations. Any action by Federal, stateor other regulators that adversely affects our ability to offer services in relation to captives, either retroactively or prospectively, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, the method by which insurance brokersare compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past decade because of the potential for conflicts of interest. Adverse regulatory developments regarding the forms of compensation we can receive (for example, continent commissions), couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   12 Table of ContentsWe could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act orother anti-corruption laws.  The FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and theirintermediaries from making improper payments (to foreign officials and otherwise) and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls. Our training program and policies mandate compliance with suchlaws. We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In recent years, two ofthe five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.K. by the FSA, and one was investigated in the U.S. by the SEC and DOJ, for improper payments to foreign officials. These firms paid significant settlements and undertookinternal investigations. If we are alleged to have violated or found to be liable for violations of anti-corruption laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our thirdparty partners or agents), we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, incur significant internal investigation costs and suffer reputational harm.  Our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfarebenefits to their employees, and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies. Many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. We have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation. Depending on future changes to health legislation, theseinvestments may not yield returns. In addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employeebenefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this law, particularly the employer mandate scheduled to enter into effectin January 2015, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.  We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedingswhich, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.  We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments,lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procurecoverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, provide clients with appropriate consulting and claims handling services, or appropriately applyfunds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. We have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to timebased on current material developments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingenciesand legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurancecoverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in suchmatters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as currentdevelopments warrant.  As more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to a number of legalproceedings, regulatory actions and other contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly orannual period. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, whichcould adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.  If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities and damage to our professional reputation. We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality brokerage and risk management services, so that wecan understand our clients needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to their needs. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it may be more damaging to our business than to other businesses and could  13 Table of Contentscause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups and/or trade associations and actively share informationamongst themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients.  The nature of much of our work, especially our actuarial services in our benefits consulting business, involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannotknow with certainty in advance. Similarly, in our institutional investment consulting and our retirement services consulting businesses, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptibleto influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming or data entry or management errors. A client may nonetheless claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice. Inaddition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums, claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability tosecure new business.  Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation. One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients confidential and proprietary information and thepersonal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information from threats such as a cybersecurity attack.Nonetheless, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personaldata, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. In the past, we have experienced attempts to wrongfully access our computer and information systems, which, if successful, could have resulted in harm to our business. Our systems weresuccessful in identifying the risk and preventing unauthorized access, and management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations. However, there can be no assurance that cybersecurity incidents thatcould have a material impact on our business will not occur.  Data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations thatsometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services, and may be more stringent in some jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changingregulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability, fines and penalties, and could damage our reputation.  Significantchanges in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues orincur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past andcurrently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptionsthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amountsof revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments (including our IRC Section 45investments), income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based onspecific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results ofoperations.  Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common Stock  Our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  We haveinvested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under IRC Section 45.  SeeNote 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments. Our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, butare not limited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below.      Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon theoperations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. These include, among others, the emissions reduction, qualifying technology, and placed-in-service requirements ofIRC Section 45, as well as the requirement that at least one of the operations owners qualifies as a producer of refined   14 Table of Contents  coal. While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have notsatisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. Additionally, Congress could modify or repeal IRC Section 45 and remove the tax credits retroactively.     Business risks. We are working to negotiate and finalize arrangements with potential co-investors for the purchase of equity stakes in one ormore of the operations that are not currently producing refined coal. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could have difficultyfinding replacements in a timely manner. We could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, causes our interestsand those of our co-investors to diverge. Finally, our partners responsible for operation and management could fail to run the operations in compliance with IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, our investment returns may benegatively impacted.      Operational risks. Chem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies (TheChem-ModTM Solution) require chemicals that may not bereadily available in the marketplace at reasonable costs. Utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers, disruptions in the supply ortransportation of coal, revocation of their Chem-Mod technologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operations. Long-term operations usingChem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies could also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short- or medium-term. A serious injury or death of a worker connected with the production of refined coal usingChem-Mods technologies could expose the operations to material liabilities, jeopardizing our investment, and could lead to reputational harm. In the event of any such operational problems, we may not be able to take full advantage of the taxcredits.      Market demand for coal. When the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn naturalgas or oil instead of coal. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. Sustained low natural gas prices may also cause utilities to phase out or close existingcoal-fired power plants. If utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, the availability of the tax credits would also be reduced.     Incompatible coal. If utilities purchase coal of a quality or type incompatible with their boilers and operations, treating such coal through acommercial refined coal plant could magnify the negative impacts of burning such coal. As a result, refined coal plants at such utilities may be removed from production until the incompatible coal has all been burned, which could cause us to beunable to take full advantage of the tax credits.      IRC Section 45 phase out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase out provisions based upon the market price of coal, such that, ifthe price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.      Environmental concerns regarding coal. Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardousnature of coal combustion waste could lead to regulations that discourage the burning of coal. For example, such regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources suchas wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. This could result in utilities burning less coal, which would reduce the generation of tax credits.      Moving a commercial refined coal plant. Changes in circumstances, such as those described above, may cause a commercial refined coal plant to bemoved to a different power generation facility, which could require us to invest additional capital.      Demand for commercial refined coal plants. The implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permittingrequirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the Environmental Protection Agency could negatively impact power generational facilitiesdemand for commercial refined coal plants, should we need to move them as described above.      Intellectual property risks. Other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod Solution.Such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable on favorable terms, if at all.If Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, the operations may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod Solution.     Strategic alternatives risk. While we currently expect to continue to hold at least a portion of these refined coal investments, if for anyreason in the future we decide to sell more of our interests, the discount rate on future cash flows could be excessive, and could result in an impairment on our investment.   15 Table of ContentsThe IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations mayresult in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs.  The construction and operation of the IRCSection 45 operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such lawsand regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulationsalso impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a partys conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances intothe environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using The Chem-Mod Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may,under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem-ModSolution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases atan operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod Solution. For example, we and our partners could face the risk of product andenvironmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facilityowners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personalinjury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Ourinsurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs ofenvironmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We havehistorically benefited from IRC Section 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss. The law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. We believe ourclaim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest.We understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them. However, while our synthetic coal operations are not currentlyunder audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnershipsclaiming IRC Section 29 tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included inManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We are exposed to various risksrelating to losses on investments held by our corporate segment.  Our corporate segment holds a variety of investments. These investmentsare subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes, including general overall economic conditions, the effects of changes in interest rates, various regulatory issues, credit risk, potential litigation, tax audits and disputes, failure tomonetize in an effective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. Any of these consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability. Additionally, our cash holdings,including cash held in our fiduciary capacity, are subject to the credit, liquidity and other risks faced by our financial institution counterparties.  The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, prepayother debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments. The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of ourbusiness and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us toadditional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing onterms acceptable to us, or at all.   16 Table of ContentsA failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a defaultunder the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver couldcause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  In the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership.  We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities.Should we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders individual ownership percentages in our company. Volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders.  The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:      General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism;     Quarterly variations in our operating results;      Seasonality of our business cycle;      Changes in the markets expectations about our operating results;     Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;     Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the financial services industry in general;     Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;     News reports relating to trends in our markets, including any expectations regarding an upcoming hard or soft market;     Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;     Material announcements by us or our competitors;      The impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our investments, including the possible perception by securities analysts or investors thatsuch investments divert management attention from our core operations;      Quarter-to-quarter volatility in the earnings impact of IRC Section 45 tax credits from our clean energy investments, due to the application ofaccounting standards applicable to the recognition of tax credits; and      Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales couldoccur.  Shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price.Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of managements attention and resources"
3,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2013-02-08,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Risks Relating to our Business Generally Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability. We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services. We do not determine the insurance premiums onwhich our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. For example, after three years of a hard market that began in late 2000 and was strengthenedby the events of September 11th, 2001, in whichpremium rates were stable or increasing, in late 2003 the market experienced the return of flat or reduced premium rates (a soft market) in many lines and geographic areas. This put downward pressure on our commission revenues. In 2012,the market began showing signs of firming (as opposed to traditional hardening) across many lines and geographic areas. In this environment, rates increased at a moderate pace, clients could still obtain coverage, businessescontinued to stay in standard-line markets and there was adequate capacity in the market. It is not clear whether this firming is sustainable given the uncertainty of the current economic environment. Because of these market cycles for insuranceproduct pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to furtherminimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Becausewe do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures,dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations. In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among otherthings, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While, historically, we have been able to participate in certain of theseactivities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities.   8 Table of ContentsAn economic downturn, as well as uncertainty regarding the European debt crisis and market perceptionsconcerning the instability of the Euro, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  An overall decline ineconomic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets,among other factors. Such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. We record the income effects of subsequent premiumadjustments when the adjustments become known and, as a result, any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. In addition, some of our clients may cease operations completely in the eventof a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which weplace insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financialcondition and results of operations. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our client, overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could reduce ourplacement of certain lines and types of insurance and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability. The failure of an insurer with whom we place business could also result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients, which couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Continued concerns regarding the ability of certain European countries toservice their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets. A potential consequence may be stagnant growth, or even recession, in the Eurozone economies and beyond, which could adversely affect ourresults of operations. The market instability caused by the Eurozone debt crisis has led to questions regarding the future viability of the Euro as a single currency for the region. The dissolution of the Euro (in the extreme case) could lead tofurther contraction in the Eurozone economies, adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, the value of our assets held in the Eurozone, including cash holdings, would decline if currencies in the region were devalued. We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.  The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations, as well as individuals, actively compete with us in one or more areas of ourbusiness around the world. We compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours. In addition, various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in aparticular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. As a U.S. company with significant operations around the world, lowercombined corporate tax rates in the countries where our overseas competitors are located could impact our ability to compete with such companies. We believe that the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations inour industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business. In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developmentsinclude:      Increased capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lowerinsurance premiums and commissions;      Insurance companies selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;     Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (for example, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation);     Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance (such as public health insurance exchanges) or, in certain cases,property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers; and     Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms and consulting firms offering risk management or insurance brokerageservices.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for ourproducts and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   9 Table of ContentsWe have historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and benefitsconsulting firms. We may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations. Historically, we have completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and benefits consulting firms and may continue to make suchacquisitions in the future. Our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfullyidentify and complete acquisitions likely will result in us achieving slower growth. Continuing consolidation in our industry could make it more difficult to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive. Even if we are able toidentify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets following acquisition in a manner that allows us to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Our ability tointegrate acquisitions may decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically. Our acquisitions also pose the risk of post-acquisition deterioration, which could result in lower or negative earnings contributionand/or goodwill impairment charges to earnings.  Additionally, we may incur or assume unanticipated liabilities or contingencies in connectionwith our acquisitions. These could include liabilities relating to regulatory or compliance issues, including, among other things, liabilities relating to violations of the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws when we acquirebusinesses with international operations. These liabilities could also include unforeseen integration difficulties, resulting in unanticipated expense, relating to accounting, information technology, human resources, or culture and fit issues. Ifany of these developments occur, our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We own interests in firms wherewe do not exercise management control (such as Casanueva Perez S.A.P. de C.V. (Grupo CP) in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achievedthrough full integration.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including our seniormanagement, brokers and other key personnel. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competitionfor the services of leading brokers, and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers, brokers or other key personnel (including the key personnel that manage ourinterests in our IRC Section 45 investments), or our inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S. We conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the U.S., including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relativelygreater than that present in the U.S. and more stable countries. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries. For example, we use third-party service providers located in Indiafor certain back-office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India. However, suchfactors could potentially affect our operations or ability to use third-party providers in the future. Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S.These include, among others, risks relating to:      Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties,environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad. These include rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Unionand the United Nations, the requirements of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate (such as the U.K. Bribery Act), as well as unexpected changes in such regulatory requirements andlaws;      Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;     Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment, and may make itmore difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;      Political and economic instability (including the potential dissolution of the Euro, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);     Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during times of crisis management;  10 Table of Contents   Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;     Adverse changes in tax rates or discriminatory or confiscatory taxation in foreign jurisdictions;     Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;     Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs; and     Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S. If any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations. Our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations, including the risk that:     The favorable trend among insureds toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causingour revenues or revenue growth to decline;      Contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints orother developments;      We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments will impose additionalburdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;      Continued economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims we process;     If we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existingcontracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);      We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations;and      Insurance companies or certain insurance consumers may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration andother administration, servicing and risk management products.  If any of these developments occur, our results of operationsand financial condition could be adversely affected.  Contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are lesspredictable than standard commissions, and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations.  A portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies. Contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability,volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria. If, due tothe current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet insurance companies profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have nocontrol), actual contingent commissions and/or supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability.  Thecost of current employees medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. In the past, we have occasionallyexperienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculatepension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs infuture years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.  11 Table of ContentsIf we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients throughtechnology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our client relationships, growth strategy, compliance programs and operating results could be adverselyaffected.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pacewith rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideasmay not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as ourcompetitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships, growth strategy, compliance programs and operating results. Our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster, material cybersecurity attack or other significant disruption to businesscontinuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Our ability to conduct business may be adverselyaffected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. For example, our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning ofRISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients with insurance claimsettlement and administration services. Disruptions could be caused by, among other things, restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, material cybersecurity attacks, or outages to electrical, communications or otherservices used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. We have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies. However, such procedures may not be effective andany insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of anyperiod during which we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects ouroperations, we may not be able to conduct our business or may be less profitable.  Many of our activities are subject to regulatorysupervision, including insurance industry regulation, Federal and state employment regulation and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S., and theFinancial Services Authority (FSA) in the U.K. As our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization. A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branchescould lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internalinvestigation costs.  In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration andenforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, although our inability to accept contingent commissions under anagreement with the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and the Director of Insurance of the State of Illinois ended on October 1, 2009, compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny ofthe public, State Attorneys General, and state insurance departments. This could lead to regulations prohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice. If this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur, our results of operations andfinancial condition could be adversely affected.  We could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or otheranti-corruption laws.  The FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries frommaking improper payments (to foreign officials and otherwise) and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls. Our training program and policies mandate compliance with such laws. We operate insome parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In recent years, two of the five publiclytraded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.K. by the FSA, and one was investigated in the U.S. by the SEC and DOJ, for improper payments to foreign officials. These firms paid significant settlements and undertook internalinvestigations. If we are found to be liable for violations of anti-corruption laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our third party partners or agents), we couldsuffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, incur significant internal investigation costs and suffer reputational harm.   12 Table of ContentsOur business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resultingfrom the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation.  In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of portions of the 2010Health Care Reform Legislation. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees. Many clients of our brokerage segmentpurchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. We have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate thecomplex requirements of this legislation. Depending on future changes to health legislation, these investments may not yield returns. In addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequentregulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employee benefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsoredhealth care in response to this law, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.  We are subject to a number of contingenciesand legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.  We are subject to numerousclaims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agentsimproperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, provide clients with appropriate consulting and claims handlingservices, or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. We have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjustsuch provisions from time to time based on current material developments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if theoutcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if,in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection againstlosses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjustedfrom time to time as current developments warrant.  As more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, we aresubject to a number of legal proceedings, regulatory actions and other contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financialcondition in any given quarterly or annual period. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion ofpersonnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation. One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients confidential and proprietary information and thepersonal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information from threats such as a cybersecurity attack.Nonetheless, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personaldata, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. In the past, we have experienced attempts to wrongfully access our computer and information systems, which, if successful, could have resulted in harm to our business. Our systems weresuccessful in identifying the risk and preventing unauthorized access, and management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations. However, there can be no assurance that cybersecurity incidents thatcould have a material impact on our business will not occur.  Data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations thatsometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services, and may be more stringent in some jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changingregulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage our reputation.  Significant changes in foreign exchangerates may adversely affect our results of operations.  Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currenciesthat differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, suchrisks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.   13 Table of ContentsChanges in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position andoperating results.  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to asGAAP). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements.We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill andother intangible assets, investments, income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to bereasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial positionand results of operations.  Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common Stock Our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  We have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under IRC Section 45.  See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments. Our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offs in connection with these investments is subject tovarious risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below.      Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon theoperations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. These include, among others, the emissions reduction, qualifying technology, and placed-in-service requirements ofIRC Section 45, as well as the requirement that at least one of the operations owners qualifies as a producer of refined coal. While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claimthese tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. Additionally, Congress could modify or repeal IRC Section 45 andremove the tax credits retroactively.      Business risks. We are working to negotiate and finalize arrangements with potential co-investors for the purchase of equity stakes in one ormore of the operations that are not currently producing refined coal. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could have difficultyfinding replacements in a timely manner. We could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, causes our interestsand those of our co-investors to diverge. Finally, our partners responsible for operation and management could fail to run the operations in compliance with IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, our investment returns may benegatively impacted.      Operational risks. Chem-Mod LLCs multi-pollutant reduction technologies (The Chem-ModTM Solution) require chemicals that may not be readily available in themarketplace at reasonable costs. Utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers, disruptions in the supply or transportation of coal, revocationof their Chem-Mod technologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operations. Long-term operations using Chem-Mods multi-pollutantreduction technologies could also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short- or medium-term. A serious injury or death of a worker connected with the production of refined coal using Chem-Mods technologies couldexpose the operations to material liabilities, jeopardizing our investment, and could lead to reputational harm. In the event of any such operational problems, we may not be able to take full advantage of the tax credits.     Market demand for coal. When the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn naturalgas or oil instead of coal. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. If utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, theavailability of the tax credits would also be reduced.      IRC Section 45 phase out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase out provisions based upon the market price of coal, such that, ifthe price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.      Environmental concerns regarding coal. Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardousnature of coal combustion waste could lead to regulations that discourage the burning of coal. For example, such regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources suchas wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. This could result in utilities burning less coal, which would reduce the generation of tax credits.   14 Table of Contents   Costs of moving a commercial refined coal plant. Changes in circumstances, such as those described above, may cause a commercial refined coalplant to be moved to a different power generation facility, which could require us to invest additional capital.      Intellectual property risks. Other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod Solution.Such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable on favorable terms, if at all.If Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, the operations may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod Solution.     Strategic alternatives risk. While we currently expect to continue to hold at least a portion of these refined coal investments, if for anyreason in the future we decide to sell more of our interests, the discount rate on future cash flows could be excessive, and could result in an impairment on our investment.  The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations andpotential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which theoperations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a partysconduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burningrefined coal produced using The Chem-Mod Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entireshare of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem Mod Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed tothe risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types ofchemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod Solution. For example, we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash producedusing The Chem-Mod Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting fullresponsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, manyenvironmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficientcoverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations andfinancial condition could be adversely affected.  We have historically benefited from IRC Section 29 tax credits and that lawexpired on December 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The lawpermitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with IRCSection 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest. We understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to othertaxpayers and have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them. However, while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcomemay cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29 tax credits. For additional information about thepotential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations.  We are exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by our corporate segment. Our corporate segment holds a variety of investments. These investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes, including general overalleconomic conditions, the effects of changes in interest rates, various regulatory issues, credit risk, potential litigation, tax audits and disputes, failure to monetize in an effective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. Any ofthese consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability. Additionally, our cash holdings, including cash held in our fiduciary capacity, are subject to the credit, liquidity and otherrisks faced by our financial institution counterparties.   15 Table of ContentsThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that couldsignificantly impact our ability to operate our business.  The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things,restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage incertain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments.  The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt mayprevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are notsimilarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make anyassurances that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  Economic, financial and industry conditionsbeyond our control may affect our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our debt. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that wouldpermit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under such agreements to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities isthrough the issuance of additional equity securities. Should we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders individual ownership percentages inour company.  Volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:     Quarterly variations in our operating results;      Seasonality of our business cycle;      Changes in the markets expectations about our operating results;     Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;     Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the financial services industry in general;     Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;     News reports relating to trends in our markets, including any expectations regarding an upcoming hard or soft market;     Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;     Material announcements by us or our competitors;      The impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our investments, including the possible perception by securities analysts or investors thatsuch investments divert management attention from our core operations;      Quarter-to-quarter volatility in the earnings impact of IRC Section 45 tax credits from our clean energy investments, due to the application ofaccounting standards applicable to the recognition of tax credits;      Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales couldoccur; and      General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism. Shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price. Any such litigation could result insubstantial cost and a diversion of managements attention and resources"
2,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2012-02-14,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Risks Relating To Our Business Generally Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability. We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services. We do not determine the insurance premiums onwhich our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. For example, for several years through late 2000, heavy competition for market share among insurancecarriers, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations, resulted in flat or reduced premium rates (a soft market). This put downward pressure on our commission revenue in many lines and in manygeographic areas. Beginning in late 2000, the insurance industry transitioned to a hard market, in which premium rates were stable or increasing. Because of the events of September 11th, many insurance lines became less available and premium ratesincreased, in some cases dramatically. Beginning in late 2003, the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas. While the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certaincoastal areas, the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to become rate and price sensitive once again. The industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines since that time, eventhough there was a higher level of hurricane activity in 2008. Because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed forsignificant periods of time.  As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue tonon-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with generalvolatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they willsignificantly decline. As a result, our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases inpremium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.   8 Table of ContentsIn addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry towardalternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While, historically we havebeen able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from ourtraditional brokerage activities.  We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses. The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations, as well as individuals,actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world. We compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours. In addition, various other competingfirms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality may have, in that region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. We believe that the primary factorsin determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having othercompetitive advantages would adversely affect our business.  In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industrydevelopments could adversely affect us. These developments include:      Increased capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lowerinsurance premiums and commissions;      Insurance companies selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;     Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (including developments relating to the medical loss ratiorequirements of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation);      Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas orother alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers; and      Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms and consulting firms offering risk management or insurance brokerageservices.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for ourproducts and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  A continuationor worsening of the recent economic recession, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  The generaldeterioration in the economy, which began in fourth quarter 2008, could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount,payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. Such reductions could also adversely impact our 2012 commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. Werecord the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and, as a result, any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. In addition, some of ourclients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivablefrom some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have asignificant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our client, overall capacity in theindustry could be negatively affected, which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability. The failure of an insurer with whom we places business could also result inerrors and omissions claims by our clients, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We havehistorically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies. We may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which couldadversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.  In the past several years, we have completed numerous acquisitions ofinsurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintainingcomparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in us achieving slower growth. Moreover, even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not be able to executeacquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows us to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Our acquisitions pose the risk of  9 Table of Contentspost-acquisition deterioration, which could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or goodwill impairment charges. Additionally, we may incur or assume unanticipated liabilities orcontingencies in connection with our acquisitions. These could include liabilities relating to accounting, information technology, human resources and regulatory or compliance issues (including, for example, liabilities relating to violations of theU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws when we acquire businesses with international operations). If any of these developments occur, our growth strategy and results of operations could beadversely affected.  Our growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S. We conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the U.S., including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relativelygreater than that present in the U.S. and more stable countries. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries. For example, we use third-party service providers located in Indiafor certain back-office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India. However, suchfactors could potentially affect our operations or ability to use third-party providers in the future. Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S.These include, among others, risk relating to:      Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;     Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment, and may make itmore difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;      Political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);     Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during times of crisis management;     Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties,environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad. This includes rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Unionand the United Nations, the requirements of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate (such as the U.K. Bribery Act), as well as unexpected changes in such regulatory requirements andlaws;      Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;     Adverse changes in tax rates or discriminatory or confiscatory taxation in foreign jurisdictions;     Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;     Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs; and     Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S. If any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations. Our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations, including the risk that:     The favorable trend among insureds toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causingour revenues or revenue growth to decline;      Contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints orother developments;      We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments will impose additionalburdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;      Continued economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims we process;     If we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existingcontracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);      We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology; and     Insurance companies or certain insurance consumers may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration andother administration, servicing and risk management products.   10 Table of ContentsIf any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.  Contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions, andany decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations.  A portion of ourrevenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies. Contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companiesduring the prior year. Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria. If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, weare unable to meet insurance companies profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent commissions and/or supplementalcommissions we receive could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our future success depends,in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.  We believe that our future success depends, in part, onour ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including our senior management, brokers and other key personnel. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our seniormanagement team. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers, and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other seniormanagers, brokers or other key personnel (including the key personnel that manage our interests in our IRC Section 45 investments),, or our inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect ourbusiness, operating results and financial condition.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability. The cost of current employees medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefitsunder our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health carecosts, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interestrates used to discount the pension plans liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limitingfuture cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.  If we are unable to apply technologyeffectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our client relationships, growth strategy,compliance programs and operating results could be adversely affected.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop andimplement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to thesedevelopments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses.If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships, growth strategy, compliance programs andoperating results.  Our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster, material cybersecurity attack or othersignificant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Our ability toconduct business may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. For example, our risk management segment is highly dependent on thecontinued and efficient functioning of RISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, toprovide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services. Disruptions could be caused by restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, material cybersecurity attacks, or outages to electrical,communications or other services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. We have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies. However, such proceduresmay not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directedagainst us because of any period during which we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on ouroperations.   11 Table of ContentsRegulatory, Legal And Accounting Risks  We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct ourbusiness or may be less profitable.  Many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision, including insurance industry regulation,Federal and state employment regulation and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Financial Services Authority in the U.K (the FSA). Failure to comply with some of these regulationscould lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internalinvestigation costs. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenuesor higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, although our inability to accept contingent commissions under an agreement with the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and the Director of Insurance of the State ofIllinois ended on October 1, 2009, compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny of the public, State Attorneys General, and state insurance departments. This could lead to regulationsprohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice. If this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. During March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act(together, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation) were signed into law. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to theiremployees. Many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. If we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting fromthis law and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employee benefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extentof employer sponsored health care in response to this law, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.  We are subject to anumber of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.  We aresubject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employeesor sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clientson a fiduciary basis. We have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current materialdevelopments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings werenot favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future, our insurance coverage proves to beinadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for theseitems, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant. As more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to a number of legal proceedings, regulatoryactions and other contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period. Inaddition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adverselyaffect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our financial results.  We could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws.  The FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials. Our training program and policiesmandate compliance with the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws. We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-briberylaws may conflict with local customs and practices. In recent years, two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.K. by the FSA, and one was investigated in the U.S. by the SEC and Department of Justice, forimproper payments to foreign officials. These firms paid   12 Table of Contentssignificant settlements and undertook internal investigations. If we are found to be liable for violations of anti-corruption laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to theacts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our third party partners or agents), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, incur significant internal investigation costs and suffer reputational harm. Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation. One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients confidential and proprietary information and thepersonal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information, such as through a cybersecurity attack.Nonetheless, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personaldata, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. We recently experienced an attempt to wrongfully access our computer and information systems, which, if successful, could have resulted in harm to our business. Our systems were successful inidentifying the risk and preventing unauthorized access, and management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations. However, there can be no assurance that cybersecurity incidents that could have amaterial impact on our business will not occur.  Data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations that sometimes conflictamong the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services, and may be more stringent in some jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirementsin this area could result in legal liability or damage our reputation.  Significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affectour results of operations.  Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from theirfunctional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot beeliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  Changes in our accountingestimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.  We prepare our financial statements inaccordance with generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure ofcontingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluateour estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments, income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. Webase our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increasecosts to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.  Risks Relating toour Investments, Debt And Common Stock  Our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under IRC Section 45. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments. Our ability to take full advantage of ourproportionate share of the tax credits generated by these operations is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below.     Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon theoperations in which we have invested, satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. These include, among others, the emissions reduction, qualifying technology, and placed-in-service requirements ofIRC Section 45, as well as the requirement that at least one of the operations owners qualifies as a producer of refined coal. While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claimthese tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. Additionally, Congress could modify or repeal IRC Section 45 andremove the tax credits retroactively.      Business risks. We are working to negotiate and finalize arrangements with potential co-investors for the purchase of equity stakes in one ormore of the operations that are not currently producing refined coal. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could have difficultyfinding replacements in a timely manner. We could also be exposed to risk due to our   13 Table of Contents  lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, caused our interests and those of our co-investorsto diverge. Finally, our partners responsible for operation and management could fail to run the operations in compliance with IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, we may unable to take full advantage of the tax credits.     Operational risks. Chem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologies require chemicals that may not be readily available in the marketplaceat reasonable costs. Utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers, disruptions in the supply of coal, revocation of their Chem-Modtechnologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operations. Long-term operations using Chem-Mods multi-pollutant reduction technologiescould also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short or medium-term. In the event of any such operational problems, we may not be able to take full advantage of the tax credits.     Market demand for coal. If the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn natural gasor oil instead of coal. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. If utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, theavailability of the tax credits would also be reduced.      IRC Section 45 phase-out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase-out provisions based upon the market price of coal, such that, ifthe price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.      Environmental concerns regarding coal. Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardousnature of coal combustion waste could lead to regulations that discourage the burning of coal. For example, such regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources suchas wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. This could result in utilities burning less coal, which would reduce the generation of tax credits.      Intellectual property risks. Other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod Solution.Such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod (or we and our partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable on favorable terms, if at all. If Chem-Mod (or we and ourpartners) cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, the operations may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod Solution.  The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations andpotential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which theoperations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a partysconduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burningrefined coal produced using The Chem-Mod Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entireshare of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem Mod Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed tothe risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types ofchemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod Solution. For example, we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash producedusing The Chem-Mod Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting fullresponsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, manyenvironmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficientcoverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations andfinancial condition could be adversely affected.   14 Table of ContentsWe have historically benefited from IRC Section 29 tax credits and that law expired onDecember 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting us toclaim IRC Section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and fourprivate letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest. We understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received noindication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them. However, while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss orcause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29 tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects ofadverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We are exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by our corporate segment. Our corporate segment holds a variety of investments. These investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes, including general overalleconomic conditions, the effects of changes in interest rates, various regulatory issues, credit risk, potential litigation, tax audits and disputes, failure to monetize in an effective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. Any ofthese consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability.  The agreements andinstruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, prepayother debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments. The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of ourbusiness and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us toadditional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or atall.  Economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control may affect our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictionscontained in the agreements governing our debt. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under such agreements to bedue and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  In the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership.  We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities.Should we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders individual ownership percentages in our company. Volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders.  The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:      Quarterly variations in our operating results;      Seasonality of our business cycle;      Changes in the markets expectations about our operating results;     Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;     Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the financial services industry in general;     Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;     News reports relating to trends in our markets, including any expectations regarding an upcoming hard or soft market;  15 Table of Contents   Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;     Material announcements by us or our competitors;      The impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our clean energy investments and expected IRC Section 45 tax credits, including thepossible perception by securities analysts or investors that such investments divert management attention from our core operations;      Quarter-to-quarter volatility in the earnings impact of Section 45 tax credits from our clean energy investments, due to the application ofaccounting standards applicable to the recognition of tax credits;      Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales couldoccur; and      General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism. Shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price. Any such litigation could result insubstantial cost and a diversion of managements attention and resources"
5,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2011-02-07,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.  Volatility or declines in premiumsor other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.  We derive much of ourrevenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on marketconditions. For example, for several years through late 2000, heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations, resulted in flat or reduced premiumrates (a soft market), which in turn put downward pressure on our commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas. Beginning in late 2000, the insurance industry transitioned to a hard market, in which premiumrates were stable or increasing. Because of the events of September 11th, many insurance lines became less available and premium rates increased, in some cases dramatically. Beginning in late 2003, the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas. While the highlevel of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certain coastal areas, the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to again become rate/price sensitive and the industry hasremained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines. The higher level of hurricane activity in 2008 generally did not cause the carriers to deviate from the trends noted in 2006 and 2007. Because of these market cycles forinsurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to reduce furthertheir expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Because we do notdetermine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividendpayments, loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations. In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among otherthings, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activitieson behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities.   8 Table of ContentsWe face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses. The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations, as well as individuals,actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world. We compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours. In addition, various other competingfirms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality may have, in that region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. We believe that the primary factorsdetermining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having othercompetitive advantages would adversely affect our business.  In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industrydevelopments could adversely affect us. These developments include:      Increased capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lowerinsurance premiums and commissions;      Insurance companies selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;     Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (including developments relating to the medical loss ratiorequirements of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation);      Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas orother alternative market types of coverage, which compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers;      Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms and consulting firms offering risk management or insurance brokerageservices; and      Insurance companies or certain insurance consumers creating in-house servicing capabilities that compete with the third party administration and otheradministration, servicing and risk management products our risk management segment offers.  New competition as a result ofthese or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A continuation or worsening of the recent economic recession, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The general deterioration in the economy, which began in fourth quarter 2008, could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in theoverall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. Such reductions could also adversely impact our 2011 commission revenueswhen the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. We record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known, and, as a result, any improvement in our results ofoperations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. In addition, some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which would have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition. We also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financialdifficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdrawsfrom writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our client, overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and, as a result, reduce our revenues andprofitability. The failure of an insurer with whom we places business could also result in errors and omissions claims by our clients, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies. We may not be able to continue to implement such anacquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.  In the past several years, we have completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Our acquisition program has been an importantpart of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in us achieving slowergrowth. Moreover, even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows us to realize theanticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Our acquisitions pose the risk of post-acquisition deterioration, which could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or goodwill impairment charges. Additionally, we may incur or assumeunanticipated liabilities or contingencies in connection with our acquisitions (including, for example, liabilities relating to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (which we refer to as FCPA) violations when we acquire businesses withinternational operations). If any of these developments occur, our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected.   9 Table of ContentsOur growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the UnitedStates, including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk.  We conduct a growing portion of our operations outsidethe United States. As a result, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries. Operating in these countries may present risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doingcomparable business in the United States. These include, among others, risk relating to:      Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;     Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment, and may make itmore difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;      Political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);     Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during times of crisis management;     Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties,environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad, including rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Union andthe United Nations, and the requirements of FCPA as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate, as well as unexpected changes in such regulatory requirements and laws;     Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the United States or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;     Adverse changes in tax rates or discriminatory or confiscatory taxation in foreign jurisdictions;     Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;     Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs; and     Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the United States. Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translatethe financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes inexchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  We also operate in certain countries where the risk of political and economicuncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the United States and more stable countries. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries. For example, we use third-partyservice providers located in India for certain back-office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected ouroperations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect our operations or ability to use third-party providers in the future. Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition couldbe adversely affected.  We face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerageoperations.  Our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations, including:     The risk that the favorable trend among insureds toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse orslow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline;      The risk that contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatoryconstraints or other developments;      The risk that we will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments will imposeadditional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;      The risk that continued economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims we process;and      The risk that if we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill ourexisting contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection).   10 Table of ContentsIf any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.  We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way thatadversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business or may be less profitable.  Many of our activities aresubject to regulatory supervision, including insurance industry regulation, Federal and state employment regulation, and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Financial ServicesAuthority (which we refer to as the FSA) in the U.K. Failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocationof our authorization to operate. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result inlost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, although our inability to accept contingent commissions under an agreement with the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and the Director of Insurance ofthe State of Illinois ended on October 1, 2009, compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny of the public, State Attorneys General, and state insurance departments, which could lead toregulations prohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice. If this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. During March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (together, the 2010Health Care Reform Legislation) were signed into law. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees. Many clients ofour brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. If we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequentregulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employee benefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsoredhealth care in response to this law, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.  We are subject to a number of contingenciesand legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.  We are subject to numerousclaims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agentsimproperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on afiduciary basis. We have established provisions against these potential matters which we believe to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments.The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorableto us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate orunavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net ofinsurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant. As more fully described in Note 17 to our 2010 consolidated financial statements, we are subject to a number of legal proceedings, regulatory actions andother contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period. In addition,regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect ourfinancial results.  Contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standardcommissions, and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations.  Aportion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies. Contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability, volume and/or growth of the business placed withsuch companies during the prior year. Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria. If, due to the current economic environment or for anyother reason, we are unable to meet insurance companies profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves, over which we have no control, actual contingent commissions and/orsupplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   11 Table of ContentsOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualifiedpersonnel.  We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including oursenior management, brokers and other key personnel. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intensecompetition for the services of leading brokers, and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers, brokers or other key personnel, or our inability to identify,recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability.  The cost of current employees medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects ourprofitability. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changesin discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans liabilities could causean increase in pension plan costs in future years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costscould reduce our profitability.  We have developed production operations with the ability to produce refined coal that we believe qualifiesfor tax credits under IRC Section 45. However, there are significant uncertainties surrounding our investment in these operations, and if we are not successful in claiming IRC Section 45 tax credits, we may not be able to recoup ourinvestment or generate additional earnings from these operations.  IRC Section 45 provides a tax credit for the production and saleof refined coal from production operations that are placed into service on or before December 31, 2011. We own 42% of Chem-Mod, LLC, which has developed technologies referred to as The Chem-Mod Solution that reduce harmful emissions fromcoal-fired power plants. We intend to use The Chem-Mod Solution to produce refined coal at eight production operations placed into service prior to December 31, 2009. We believe that the production and sale of this refined coal qualifiesfor IRC Section 45 tax credits. We incurred $31.4 million of capital expenditures in 2009 to complete the construction of these operations. We sold portions of our ownership stake in six of these operations, which reduced our net investment inthe operations to $22.3 million.  There are significant uncertainties related to our IRC Section 45 investments that must be favorablyresolved in order for us to recoup our investment and generate additional earnings from these operations. These include, but are not limited to:      Long-term permits must still be obtained. To date, one of the operations has received a permanent regulatory operating permit. The remainingseven operations are not currently operating. In order to obtain long-term permits, the utilities need to show not only reductions in nitrogen oxides and mercury emissions, as IRC Section 45 requires, but also reductions in sulfur, carbonmonoxide and particulate emissions while at the same time maintaining all other emissions limits and performance standards required under their air permits. If for any reason the operations are unable to satisfy the regulatory permittingrequirements and the utilities are unable to timely obtain long-term permits, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.     All conditions under IRC Section 45 must be satisfied. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon thesatisfaction of a number of conditions specified in IRC Section 45. While we have received some confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, we may ultimately be determined not to have satisfied such conditionsif, among other things, our conclusions with respect to one or more of the following are incorrect: the accuracy of the emissions reduction analyses upon which we have relied and continue to rely, that The Chem-Mod Solution representsqualifying technologies under the rules, that the operations applied the technologies correctly such that at least one of the operations owners (we or one of our partners) qualifies as a producer of refined coal, or that ouroperations were placed into service by December 31, 2009. Additionally, IRC Section 45 contains phase-out provisions based upon the market price of coal. As a result, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some orall of the future tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.      Additional regulatory uncertainties. In the future, utilities may become subject to other regulations that render The Chem-Mod Solutionobsolete or unusable. Congress may modify or repeal IRC Section 45 so that these tax credits may no longer be available or the law may be interpreted to exclude The Chem-Mod Solution. In addition, current environmental laws andregulations limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants could be significantly weakened, reducing demand for technologies like The Chem-Mod Solution, or could be strengthened beyond the capabilities of The Chem-Mod Solutionto comply. If any of these regulatory developments occur, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.   12 Table of Contents   Utilities use of coal may decline. Increasing concerns about greenhouse gases and other air emissions, toxic materials in wastewaterdischarges and the potential hazardous nature of coal combustion waste, whether as a result of concerns about global climate change or otherwise, could lead to Federal or state regulations that encourage or require utilities to burn less coal, oreliminate its use entirely, in the production of electricity. In addition, while the utilities at which the operations are located have traditionally burned coal to generate electricity, some are also engineered to burn other fuels such as naturalgas and oil. Thus, if the price of natural gas and/or oil is low enough relative to the price of coal, utilities may choose to burn natural gas or oil instead of coal to produce electricity. Demand for coal, generally, may also decline as a resultof an economic slowdown and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. If, for any reason, utilities burn less or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earningsfrom these operations.      Operational risks. The operations ability to produce refined coal meeting the requirements of IRC Section 45 may be affected byoperational issues. Chem-Mods coal-cleaning technologies require proprietary chemical inputs that may not be readily available in the marketplace or available only at prohibitively high costs. The power plants at which the operations arelocated could be idled for reasons outside our control, including, among other things, operational or environmental problems at the plants, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could haltor impede production at the operations. Other operational risks include the availability and cost of coal (including freight cost), the possibility that the refined coal the operations produce may cause operational problems in the utilitiesboilers, the risk that equipment may not be properly maintained, the risk that the operations might be unable to operate at their rated capacity, and the possibility that the operations could be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key personnelneeded for efficient production. If the operations encounter any operational problems, including the types described above, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.     Business risks. We have finalized arrangements with two co-investors, and are working to finalize arrangements with other potentialco-investors, for the purchase of equity stakes in one or more of the operations. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could havedifficulty finding replacements in a timely manner. We are exposed to credit risk with our co-investors and operational partners, any of which could encounter economic difficulties and become unable to fulfill payment obligations. We could also beexposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, caused our interests and those of our co-investors to diverge. Finally, ourpartners involved in the operation and management of the operations could fail to run the operations in a manner that complies with the requirements of IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, we may not be able to recoup ourinvestment or generate additional earnings from these operations.      Intellectual property risks. Other companies with technologies similar to The Chem-Mod Solution may make claims of intellectual propertyinfringement against Chem-Mod or against us and our partners. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod or we and our partners obtain a license to use the intellectual property. Chem-Mod or we and ourpartners may be unable to obtain licenses from these third parties on favorable terms, if at all. If Chem-Mod or we and our partners cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, we may be precluded from using TheChem-Mod Solution and may be unable to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations. Our IRC Section 45 operations and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmentalcompliance costs.  The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws,regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities atwhich the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of apartys conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as aresult of burning refined coal produced using The Chem-Mod Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its shareor the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem Mod Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners maybe exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to thetypes of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod Solution. For example, we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ashproduced using The Chem-Mod Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator acceptingfull responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by   13 Table of Contentsthird parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety lawsauthorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of anenvironmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could beadversely affected.  We have historically benefited from Section 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. Thedisallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulingspreviously obtained by IRC Section 29-related partnerships in which we had an interest. We understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the IRS that it willseek to revoke or modify them. However, while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability underindemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29 tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnificationcontingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation.  One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and other benefitplan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personallyidentifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries inwhich we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage our reputation. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate ourbusiness.  The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incuradditional debt, prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change ourbusiness or make investments.  The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe wouldbe in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debtobligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance ourdebt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  Economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control may affect our ability to complywith the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our debt. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amountsoutstanding under such agreements to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP). These accountingprinciples require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required tomake certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets,investments, income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based onspecific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results ofoperations.   14 Table of ContentsIf we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients throughtechnology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools, our client relationships, growth strategy and operating results could be adversely affected. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuingchanges in technology, industry standards and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally,the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost-effectivetechnologies, we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships, growth strategy and operating results.  Ourinability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. This mayinclude a disruption caused by restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, or outages to electrical, communications or other services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business.Although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies, such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable pricesand may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significantdisruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  We are exposed to various risks relating tolosses on investments held by our corporate segment.  Our corporate segment holds a variety of investments. These investments are subjectto risk of loss due to a variety of causes, including general overall economic conditions, the effects of changes in interest rates, various regulatory issues, credit risk, potential litigation, tax audits and disputes, failure to monetize in aneffective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. Any of these consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability. In the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership. We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities isthrough the issuance of additional equity securities. Should we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders individual ownership percentages inour company.  Volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:     Quarterly variations in our operating results;      Seasonality of our business cycle;      Changes in the markets expectations about our operating results;     Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;     Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the financial services industry in general;     Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;     News reports relating to trends in our markets;      Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;     Material announcements by us or our competitors;      Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales couldoccur; and      General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism.   15 Table of Contents"
1,AJG,ARTHUR J GALLAGHER & CO,2010-02-05,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine Gallaghers profitability. Gallagher derives much of its revenue from commissions and fees for its brokerage services. Gallagher does notdetermine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. For example, for several years through late 2000, heavy competitionfor market share among insurance carriers, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations, resulted in flat or reduced premium rates (a soft market), which in turn put downward pressure onGallaghers commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas. Beginning in late 2000, the insurance industry transitioned to a hard market, in which premium rates were stable or increasing. Because of the events ofSeptember 11th, many insurance lines became lessavailable and premium rates increased, in some cases dramatically. Beginning in late 2003, the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas. While the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused ahard market in certain coastal areas, the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to again become rate/price sensitive and the industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines. Thehigher level of hurricane activity in 2008 generally did not cause the carriers to deviate from the trends noted in 2006 and 2007. Because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing, which Gallagher cannot predict or control, its brokeragerevenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As traditional risk-bearing insurancecompanies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as Gallagher, those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agentsor brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect Gallaghers profitability. Because Gallagher does not determine the timing or extent of premium pricingchanges, Gallagher cannot accurately forecast its commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, Gallaghers budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments andother expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of its operations.  In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives,rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While Gallagher historically has been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of its customers and obtain feerevenue for such services, there can be no assurance that Gallagher will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from its traditional brokerage activities.  Gallagher faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses.  The insurancebrokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with Gallagher in one or more areas of its business. Gallaghercompetes with four firms that are as large as or significantly larger than Gallagher, in terms of revenues, in the global risk management and brokerage markets. In addition, there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that arestrong in a particular region or locality and may have, in that region or locality, an office that is as large as or larger than, in terms of revenues, the particular local office of Gallagher. Gallagher believes that the primary factors determiningits competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitiveadvantages would adversely affect Gallaghers business.  In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industrydevelopments could adversely affect Gallagher. These developments include:      An increase in capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lowerinsurance premiums and commissions;      The selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;     Changes in Gallaghers business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments;      The establishment of programs by Federal and state governments to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance incatastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, which compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers;   9 Table of Contents   An increase in competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms and consulting firms offering risk management or insurancebrokerage services; and      The creation of in-house servicing capabilities by insurance companies or by certain insurance consumers which compete with the third partyadministration and other administration, servicing and risk management products offered by Gallaghers Risk Management Segment.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for Gallaghers products and services to change, which could in turn adversely affect Gallaghers results of operations andfinancial condition.  The current disruption in the global credit markets and instability of financial systems, and a continuation orworsening of the current economic recession, may adversely affect Gallaghers results of operations and financial condition.  Thecurrent disruption in the global credit markets, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies.These conditions include significant losses, greater volatility, significantly less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets. These conditions have resulted in the failure of a number of financialinstitutions and unprecedented action by governmental authorities and central banks around the world, including investing in or lending money to financial institutions and insurance companies that are perceived to need additional capital. It isdifficult to predict how long these conditions will persist and the extent to which Gallaghers markets, products and business will be adversely affected.  These unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets and the resulting impact on a number of financial institutions have limited access to capital and credit for many companies. AlthoughGallagher is not currently experiencing any limitation of access to its revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2010, and is not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of its lenders under such facility to honor theircommitments to extend Gallagher credit, the failure of a lender could adversely affect its ability to borrow on that facility, which over time could negatively impact Gallaghers ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make othersignificant capital expenditures. Continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings.  The disruptions in the credit and financial markets also led to a general deterioration in the economy in fourth quarter 2008 and throughout 2009, whichcould adversely impact Gallagher in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that its clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among otherfactors. Such reductions could also adversely impact Gallaghers 2010 and 2011 commission revenues when exposure audits by the carriers are performed and if subsequent downward premium adjustments are determined. The income effects ofsubsequent premium adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known, and, as a result, any improvement in Gallaghers results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. In addition, some ofGallaghers clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which would have an adverse effect on Gallaghers results of operations and financial condition. Gallagher also has a significantamount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which it places insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, Gallagher could encounter delays or defaults inpayments owed to Gallagher, which could have a significant adverse impact on Gallaghers consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurancecoverages that Gallagher offers its clients, overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could reduce Gallaghers placement of certain lines and types of insurance and, as a result, reduce its revenues andprofitability. The failure of an insurer with whom Gallagher places business could also result in errors and omissions claims by Gallaghers clients, which could adversely affect Gallaghers results of operations and financial condition. Gallagher has historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies. Gallagher may not be able tocontinue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions.  In the pastseveral years, Gallagher has completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Gallaghers acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth andGallagher believes that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in Gallagher achieving slower growth. Moreover, evenif Gallagher is able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, it may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows Gallagher to realize the anticipatedbenefits of such acquisitions. Additionally, Gallagher may incur or assume unanticipated liabilities or contingencies in connection with its acquisitions. If any of these developments occur, Gallaghers results of operations could be adverselyaffected.   10 Table of ContentsThe agreements and instruments governing Gallaghers debt contain restrictions and limitations thatcould significantly impact Gallaghers ability to operate its business.  The agreements governing Gallaghers debt containcovenants that, among other things, restrict Gallaghers ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similartransactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change Gallaghers business or make investments.  The restrictions in the agreements governing Gallaghers debt may prevent it from taking actions that it believes would be in the best interest of Gallaghers business and its stockholders and may make it difficult for Gallagherto execute its business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Gallagher may also incur future debt obligations that might subject it to additional or more restrictive covenants that couldaffect Gallaghers financial and operational flexibility. Gallagher cannot make any assurances that it will be able to refinance its debt on terms acceptable to Gallagher, or at all.  Gallaghers ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing Gallaghers debt may be affected byeconomic, financial and industry conditions beyond Gallaghers control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amountsoutstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which could have a material adverse effect on Gallaghers financial condition and results of operations.  Gallagher could incur substantial losses if one of the commercial banks and financial institutions Gallagher uses in its operations should happen tofail.  Gallagher maintains cash balances, including restricted cash held in premium trust and claim accounts, at various depositoryinstitutions. Although Gallagher has moved a substantial portion of its U.S. funds into accounts or funds insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government, there are client claim funds, which Gallagher administers that are in individual accounts withbalances well in excess of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Gallagher also maintains cash balances in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs. If one ormore of the depository institutions in which Gallagher maintains significant cash balances were to fail, Gallaghers ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and Gallagher could face a significant liquidityproblem and potentially material financial losses.  Gallagher has non-U.S. operations which expose it to certain additional risks,including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk.  Gallagher has operations that conduct business outside the U.S.Accordingly, Gallagher is subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries. Operating in these countries may present risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks to Gallagher of doing comparablebusiness in the U.S. These include, among others, risk relating to:      Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;      Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit Gallaghers ability to prohibit employees from competing with Gallagher after theiremployment, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;      Political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);      Coordinating Gallaghers communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones;      The requirement of complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties,environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad, including rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Union andthe United Nations, and the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which Gallagher operates, as well as unexpected changes in such regulatoryrequirements and laws;      Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which Gallagher operates;     Adverse changes in tax rates;      Legal or political constraints on Gallaghers ability to maintain or increase prices; and      Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to Gallagher from its operations outside the U.S.   11 Table of ContentsSome of Gallaghers foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies thatdiffer from their functional currencies. Gallagher must also translate the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although Gallagher has used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past, such risks cannot be eliminatedentirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect Gallaghers results of operations.  Gallagher also operates incertain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the U.S. and more stable countries. Gallaghers operations in these countries may be temporarily or permanently disrupted byadverse geopolitical or economic conditions in these locations. For example, Gallagher uses third-party service providers located in India for certain back-office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmirregion, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected Gallaghers operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect Gallaghers operations or ability to utilizethird-party providers in the future. Should Gallaghers access to these services be disrupted, Gallaghers business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Gallagher faces a variety of risks in its Risk Management operations that are distinct from those it faces in its Brokerage operations. Gallaghers Risk Management business faces a variety of risks distinct from those faced by its Brokerage business, including:      The risk that the favorable trend among insureds toward outsourcing of various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverseor slow, causing Gallagher to experience reduced revenues or a reduced rate of revenue growth;      The risk that contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on its services will be decreased due to increased competition,regulatory constraints or other developments;      The risk that Gallagher will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments willimpose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make its business less attractive;      The risk that the recession and corresponding slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims processed byGallagher; and      The risk that Gallagher will not be able to control its labor and technology costs in such a manner as to remain competitive in the marketplace forclaims administration and risk management services and fulfill its existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection) in a cost-efficient and profitable manner.  If any of these developments occur, Gallaghers results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Gallagher is subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide. If Gallagher fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in away that adversely affects Gallaghers operations, Gallagher may not be able to conduct its business or may be less profitable.  Manyof Gallaghers activities are subject to regulatory supervision. Failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary actions that may include requiring clients to be compensated for loss, the imposition of penalties andthe revocation of Gallaghers authorization to operate. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time-to-time require operationalchanges that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder Gallaghers ability to operate its business. For example, although Gallaghers inability to accept contingent commissions under an agreement with the Attorney General ofthe State of Illinois and the Director of Insurance of the State of Illinois ended on October 1, 2009, compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny of the public, State Attorneys General, andstate insurance departments, which could lead to regulations prohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice. If this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur, Gallaghers results of operations and financial condition could beadversely affected.  Changes in Gallaghers accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect its financial position andoperating results.  Gallagher prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).These accounting principles require Gallagher to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its Consolidated Financial Statements.Gallagher is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. Gallagher periodically evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation ofintangible assets,  12 Table of Contentsinvestments, income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. Gallagher bases its estimates on historical experience andvarious assumptions that Gallagher believes to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have anadverse impact on Gallaghers future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Gallagher is subject to a number ofcontingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to Gallagher, would adversely affect its financial results.  Gallagheris subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that itsemployees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that Gallagherholds for its clients on a fiduciary basis. Gallagher has established provisions against these potential matters which it believes to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and Gallagher adjusts such provisions fromtime-to-time based on current material developments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of thesecontingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to Gallagher, it could materially adversely affect its future financial results. In addition, Gallaghers results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affectedif in the future, Gallaghers insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which it self-insures. Gallagher has purchased errors and omissions (E&O) insurance and other insurance toprovide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals andreceivables are adjusted from time-to-time as current developments warrant.  As more fully described in Note 17 to Gallaghers 2009Consolidated Financial Statements, Gallagher is subject to a number of legal proceedings, regulatory actions and other contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect onGallaghers business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on Gallagher by exposing itto negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to Gallaghers client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources.  Contingent commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions, and any decrease in the amount of contingent commissions received by Gallagher could adversely affectits results of operations.  Gallagher derives a portion of its revenues from contingent commissions paid by insurance companies. Contingentcommissions are special revenue-sharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. If, due to the current economic environment or forany other reason, Gallagher is unable to meet insurance companies profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves, over which Gallagher has no control, actual contingentcommissions received by Gallagher could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect Gallaghers results of operations. Additionally, because of these uncertainties, it is difficult for Gallagher to make profit-sharing calculationsand accurately estimate the amount of contingent commissions it will receive during a given year.  Gallaghers future success depends,in part, on its ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.  Gallagher believes that its future success depends, inpart, on its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including its senior management, brokers and other key personnel. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers, andGallagher has lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of any of its senior managers, brokers or other key personnel, or its inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affectGallaghers business, operating results and financial condition.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduceGallaghers profitability.  Gallaghers profitability is substantially affected by the cost of current employees medicaland other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under its legacy defined benefit plans. In recent years, Gallagher has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economicfactors beyond Gallaghers control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate  13 Table of Contentspension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of Gallaghers defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pensionplans liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years. Although Gallagher has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance Gallagher will succeed in limiting future cost increases,and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce Gallaghers profitability.  Gallagher has historically benefited fromSection 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting Gallagher to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits related to Gallaghers synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Gallaghersannual effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was 36.9%, 31.9% and 22.7%, respectively. Gallaghers overall effective income tax rate for 2007 reflects the tax credits generated by investments in limited partnerships that operatedalternative energy projects under IRC Section 29. The rates for 2009, 2008 and 2007 reflect the impact of the resolution of a number of income tax matters related to prior years and revisions to estimates of uncertain tax positions, whichresulted in a net decrease in Gallaghers tax provision of $3.6 million, $14.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively.  Gallagherbelieves its claim for IRC Section 29-related related tax credits is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings (PLRs) previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related partnerships in which it had an interest.Gallagher understands these PLRs are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and has received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them.  While Gallaghers synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause Gallagher to besubject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29-related tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse taxaudits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Gallagher has developed production facilities with the ability to produce refined coal that it believes qualifies for tax credits under IRCSection 45. However, there are significant uncertainties surrounding Gallaghers investment in these facilities, and if Gallagher is not successful in claiming IRC Section 45 tax credits, Gallagher may not be able to recoup itsinvestment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.  IRC Section 45 provides a taxcredit for the production and sale of refined coal from production facilities that were placed into service on or before December 31, 2009. Gallagher owns 42% of Chem-Mod, LLC, which has developed technologies (The Chem-Mod Solution) that reduce harmful emissions from coal-fired power plants. Gallagher intends to use The Chem-Mod Solution to produce refined coal at eight production facilities placed into service prior to December 31,2009. Gallagher believes that the production and sale of this refined coal qualifies for IRC Section 45 tax credits. Gallagher has funded $29.7 million of capital expenditures to date, and has committed to make additional capital expendituresof $1.7 million in 2010 to complete the construction contract obligations of these facilities. Once Gallagher has finalized arrangements with various partners expected to purchase equity stakes in one or more of the facilities, Gallaghersnet investment in the facilities is expected to be approximately $16.0 million.  There are significant uncertainties related toGallaghers IRC Section 45 investments that must be favorably resolved in order for Gallagher to recoup its investment and generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities. These include, but are not limited to:     Long-term permits must still be obtained. The eight facilities are currently operating under temporary permits obtained by the utilities uponwhose properties the refined coal production facilities are located. In order to obtain long-term permits, the utilities need to show not only reductions in nitrogen oxides and mercury emissions, as required by IRC Section 45, but alsoreductions in sulfur, carbon monoxide and particulate emissions while at the same time maintaining all other emissions limits and performance standards required under their air permits. If for any reason the facilities are unable to satisfy theregulatory permitting requirements and the utilities are unable to timely obtain long-term permits, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.     All conditions under IRC Section 45 must be satisfied. Gallaghers ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends uponthe satisfaction of a number of conditions specified in IRC Section 45. Gallagher may be determined not to have satisfied such conditions if, among other things, Gallaghers conclusions with respect to one or more of the following areincorrect: the accuracy of the emissions reduction analyses upon which Gallagher has relied and continues to rely, that The Chem-Mod Solution represents qualifying technologies under the rules, that the technologies were applied correctly  14 Table of Contents  by the facilities such that at least one of the facilities owners (Gallagher or one of its partners) can be treated as a producer of refined coal, or that the facilities wereplaced into service by December 31, 2009. Additionally, IRC Section 45 contains phase-out provisions based upon the market price of coal. As a result, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, Gallagher could lose some or all of thefuture tax credits it expects to receive from these investments.      Additional regulatory uncertainties. In the future, utilities may become subject to other regulations that render The Chem-Mod Solution obsolete or unusable. Congress may modify or repeal IRC Section 45 so that these tax credits may nolonger be available or the law may be interpreted to exclude The Chem-Mod Solution. In addition, currentenvironmental laws and regulations limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants could be significantly weakened, reducing demand for technologies like The Chem-Mod Solution, or could be strengthened beyond the capabilities of The Chem-Mod Solution to comply. If any of these regulatory developments occur, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from theoperation of these facilities.      Utilities use of coal may decline. Increasing concerns about greenhouse gases and other air emissions, toxic materials in wastewaterdischarges and the potential hazardous nature of coal combustion waste, could lead to Federal or state regulations that encourage or require utilities to burn less coal, or eliminate its use entirely, in the production of electricity. In addition,while the utilities at which the facilities are located have traditionally burned coal to generate electricity, some are also engineered to burn other fuels such as natural gas and oil. Thus, if the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relativeto the price of coal, utilities may choose to burn natural gas or oil instead of coal to produce electricity. Demand for coal, generally, may also decline as a result of a slowing economy and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. If,for any reason, utilities burn less or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.      Operational risks. The facilities ability to produce refined coal meeting the requirements of IRC Section 45 may be affected byoperational issues. Chem-Mods coal-cleaning technologies require proprietary chemical inputs that may not be readily available in the marketplace or available only at prohibitively high costs. The power plants at which the facilities arelocated could be idled for reasons outside Gallaghers control, including, among other things, operational or environmental problems at the plants, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any ofwhich could halt or impede the operation of the facilities. Other operational risks include the availability and cost of coal (including freight cost), the possibility that the refined coal produced by the facilities may cause operational problemsin the utilities boilers, the risk that equipment may not be properly maintained, the risk that the facilities might be unable to operate at their rated capacity, and the possibility that the facilities could be unsuccessful in attracting andretaining key personnel needed for efficiently operating the facilities. If the facilities encounter any operational problems, including the types described above, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earningsfrom the operation of these facilities.      Business risks. Gallagher has finalized arrangements with one co-investor, and is working to finalize arrangements with other potentialco-investors, for the purchase of equity stakes in one or more of the facilities. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of Gallaghers co-investors leave a project,Gallagher could have difficulty finding replacements in a timely manner. Gallagher is exposed to credit risk with its co-investors and operational partners, any of which could encounter economic difficulties and become unable to fulfill paymentobligations. Gallagher could also be exposed to risk due to its lack of control over the facilities if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, caused the interests of Gallagher and itsco-investors to diverge. Finally, Gallaghers partners involved in the operation and management of the facilities could fail to operate the facilities in a manner that complies with the requirements of IRC Section 45. If any of thesedevelopments occur, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.      Intellectual property risks. Other companies with technologies similar to The Chem-Mod Solution may make claims of intellectual property infringement against Chem-Mod or Gallagher and its partners. Any intellectual property claims, with or withoutmerit, could require that Chem-Mod or Gallagher and its partners obtain a license to use the intellectual property. Chem-Mod or Gallagher and its partners may be unable to obtain licenses from these third parties on favorable terms, if at all. IfChem-Mod or Gallagher and its partners cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, Gallagher may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod Solution and may be unable to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.  Operations at the IRC Section 45 production facilities and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liabilityclaims and environmental compliance costs.  The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 production facilities are subject toFederal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require thefacilities and/or the utilities at which the facilities are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and  15 Table of Contentsregulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a partys conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in,the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using The Chem-Mod Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bearmore than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem Mod Solution at facilities owned and operated by others, Gallagher and its partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage they may havehad little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after operations cease at a facility to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with TheChem-Mod Solution. For example, Gallagher and its partners could face the risk of product and environmentalliability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod Solution. No assurancescan be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It isalso not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorizecitizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Gallaghers insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of anenvironmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, Gallaghers results of operations and financial conditioncould be adversely affected.  Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm Gallaghers reputation. One of Gallaghers significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of its clients confidential andproprietary information and the personal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants. Gallagher maintains policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information.Nonetheless, Gallagher cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm Gallaghers reputation and subject it to liability under its contracts and lawsthat protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.  Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rulesand regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which Gallagher provides services. Gallaghers failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirementsin this area, could result in legal liability or impairment to Gallaghers reputation in the marketplace.  Gallagher is exposed tovarious risks relating to losses on investments held by its Financial Services business.  Gallaghers Financial Services businessholds a variety of investments. These investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes, including general overall economic conditions, the effects of changes in interest rates, various regulatory issues, credit risk, potentiallitigation, tax audits and disputes, failure to monetize in an effective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. Any of these consequences may diminish the value of Gallaghers invested assets and adversely affect its net worthand profitability"
