11,BPOP,POPULAR INC,2024-02-29,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We, like other financial institutions, face risks inherent to our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The risks described in this report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or that are generally applicable to all financial institutions, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital position. ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS Weakness in the economy, particularly in Puerto Rico, where a significant portion of our business is concentrated, has adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely impact us in the future. We have been, and will continue to be, impacted by global and local economic and market conditions, including weakness in the economy, disruptions and volatility in the financial markets, inflation, monetary and fiscal policies, public policy, geopolitical conflicts, business and consumer sentiment and unemployment. A significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which accounted for approximately 77% of our assets and 81% of our deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 78% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and other conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The concentration of our operations in Puerto Rico exposes us to greater risks than other banking companies with a wider geographic base. Puerto Rico has faced significant economic and fiscal challenges in the past, including a severe recession that began in 2007 and persisted for over a decade and an acute fiscal crisis that led the Puerto Rico government to file for a form of federal bankruptcy protection in 2017. Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic challenges have in the past adversely affected our customers, resulting in higher delinquencies, charge-offs and increased losses for us. While Puerto Rico’s economy has been gradually recovering and the Puerto Rico government emerged from bankruptcy in 2022, Puerto Rico still faces economic and fiscal challenges. Moreover, Puerto Rico has historically received a significant amount of federal funds through non-recurring appropriations, particularly to cover costs associated with its health insurance program, and Puerto Rico’s recent economic recovery has been partially driven by significant federal disaster relief and stimulus funding. Therefore, the Puerto Rico economy is highly susceptible to changes in federal public policy towards Puerto Rico. Public policy changes that result in a reduction of federal funding for Puerto Rico, or in delays in the receipt of such funding, could significantly impact Puerto Rico’s economy. A weakening of the Puerto Rico economy or other adverse economic conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses could result in    25 decreased demand for our products or services, deterioration in the credit quality of our customers, higher delinquencies, charge-offs or increased losses, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are also exposed to risks related to the state of the local economies of the other markets in which we do business, such as New York and Florida, and to the state of the global and U.S. economy and financial markets. Global financial markets have recently experienced periods of extraordinary disruption and volatility, exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts, the U.S. debt-ceiling situation, high levels of inflation and rapid increases in interest rates. Inflationary pressures increased certain of our expenses (including our personnel expenses) and adversely affected consumer sentiment. Central bank responses to inflationary pressures led to higher market interest rates and, in turn, lower activity levels across U.S. and global financial markets. These circumstances resulted in, and could continue to result in, reductions in the value of our investments. If these conditions persist or worsen, our results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely impact our financial condition, including our investment portfolio, since a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. Our business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates. Since a high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates, have had and could in the future have a material impact on our results of operations and the values of our assets and liabilities, including our investment portfolio. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors over which we have no control and which we may not be able to anticipate adequately, including general economic conditions and the monetary and tax policies of various governmental bodies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. Increasing levels of inflation, driven by pent-up demand and supply-chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, led the Federal Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (the “FOMC”) to execute a series of sharp benchmark interest rate increases beginning in the first quarter of 2022. While the FOMC has indicated that it may conclude its interest rate hike cycle, the amount and pace of any reduction in interest rates remains uncertain. Higher interest rates could lead to fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans, loss of deposits, a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings, less liquidity in the financial markets and higher funding costs. Furthermore, higher interest rates could negatively affect the payment performance on loans linked to variable interest rates to the extent borrowers are unable to afford higher interest payments, which could result in higher delinquencies. Inflationary pressure arising from increases in interest rates may also affect borrowers’ financial condition and their ability to pay their debts when due. Additionally, if the interest rates we pay on our deposits and other borrowings were to increase at a faster rate than the interest rates we receive on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and, therefore, our earnings, could be adversely affected. All of these outcomes could adversely affect our earnings, liquidity and capital levels. The rapid rise in interest rates in 2022 resulted in approximately $2.5 billion in unrealized mark-to-market losses on available-for-sale securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In October 2022, we transferred U.S. Treasury securities with a fair value of approximately $6.5 billion (par value of $7.4 billion), and with accumulated unrealized losses of $873 million, from our available-for-sale portfolio to our held-to-maturity portfolio. While the size of our unrealized mark-to-market losses on available-for-sale securities had been reduced to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, if interest rates were to again rise rapidly or for a prolonged period, we may accumulate significant additional mark-to-market losses on investment securities in our available-for-sale portfolio, which may adversely affect our tangible capital and impact our ability to return capital to our stockholders. For a discussion of the Corporation’s interest rate sensitivity, please refer to the “Risk Management” section of the MD&A in this Form 10-K. BUSINESS RISKS Negative changes in the financial condition of our clients have adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely impact us in the future.  A significant portion of our business involves lending money, which exposes us to credit risk and risk of loss if borrowers do not repay their loans, leases, credit cards or other credit obligations. The performance of these credit portfolios significantly affects our financial condition and results of operations. We have in the past been adversely affected by negative changes in the financial condition of our clients due to weakness in the Puerto Rico and U.S. economy. If the current economic environment were to     26 deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their credit obligations, which may result in higher levels of credit losses and reserves for credit losses. We are exposed to increased credit risks and credit losses to the extent our clients are concentrated by industry segment or type of client. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase to the extent our loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or in borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by certain economic or market conditions. We have significant exposure to borrowers in certain economic sectors, such as residential and commercial real estate, hospitality and healthcare. Challenging economic or market conditions that affect the industries or types of clients to which we have significant exposure could result in higher credit losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We also have direct lending and investment exposure to Puerto Rico government entities, which have faced significant fiscal challenges. At December 31, 2023, our exposure to the Puerto Rico government consisted of $362 million in direct lending exposure to Puerto Rico municipalities and $238 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental. We also have indirect lending exposure to the Puerto Rico government in the form of loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the Puerto Rico government. While the overall fiscal situation of the Puerto Rico government has improved in recent years, including as result of the government and certain of its instrumentalities having restructured their debt obligations, some Puerto Rico government entities, including certain municipalities, still face significant fiscal challenges. A deterioration in the fiscal situation of the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities, and in particular in the fiscal situation of the Puerto Rico municipalities to which we have direct lending exposure, could result in higher credit losses and reserves for credit losses. For a discussion of risks related to the Corporation’s credit exposure to the Puerto Rico and USVI governments, see the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&A section of this Form 10-K. Deterioration in the values of real properties securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction portfolios have in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in increased credit losses and harm our results of operations.As of December 31, 2023, approximately 55% of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by real estate collateral (comprised of 30% in commercial loans, 22% in residential mortgage loans and 3% in construction loans). The value of the collateral securing such loans is dependent upon economic conditions in the area in which the collateral is located. Weakness in the economy of some of the markets we serve has in the past resulted in significant declines in the value of the real properties securing our loan portfolio, leading to increased credit losses. If the value of the real estate properties securing our loan portfolio declines again in the future, we may be required to increase our provisions for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk section of the MD&A included in this Form 10-K.We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements. Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. However, we have retained part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans through recourse arrangements, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December 31, 2023, we were exposed to credit risk with respect to $0.6 billion in residential mortgage loans sold or serviced subject to credit recourse provisions, consisting principally of loans associated with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. Pursuant to such recourse provisions, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss in the event of a customer default. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. During 2023, we repurchased approximately $2 million in mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2023, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $4 million. We may suffer losses on these loans if the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property. Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.     27 In connection with the sale and securitization of mortgage loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and they relate to, among other things, compliance with laws and regulations, underwriting standards, the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan. A loan that does not comply with the secondary market’s requirements may take longer to sell, impact our ability to securitize the loans or pledge the loans as collateral for borrowings, or be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount. Moreover, if any such loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss. We seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. However, if we were to suffer significant losses from defective and repurchased loans, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially impacted. If we are unable to maintain or grow our deposits, we may be subject to paying higher funding costs and our net interest income may decrease.  We rely primarily on bank deposits as a low cost and stable source of funding for our lending activities and the operation of our business. Therefore, our funding costs are largely dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our deposits. As our competitors have raised the interest rates they pay on deposits, our funding costs have increased, as we have needed to increase the rates we pay to our depositors to avoid losing deposits and to procure new ones. Rising interest rates have also led customers to move their funds to alternative investments that pay higher interest rates. Additionally, periods of market stress or lack of market or customer confidence in financial institutions may result in a loss of customer deposits, especially to the extent those deposits are in excess of the FDIC-insured limit of $250,000. As of December 31, 2023, we had $14.6 billion of deposits (other than collateralized public funds, which represent public deposit balances from governmental entities in the U.S. and its territories, including Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, that are collateralized based on such jurisdictions’ applicable collateral requirements) in excess of the FDIC-insured limit. As deposits decrease, we may need to rely on more expensive sources of funding. Furthermore, we have a significant amount of deposits from the Puerto Rico government, its instrumentalities and municipalities ($18.1 billion, or approximately 28% of our total deposits, as of December 31, 2023), and the amount of these deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of these entities, as well as on our ability to maintain these customer relationships. Under the terms of BPPR’s deposit pricing agreement with Puerto Rico public sector, public fund deposit rates are market linked with a lag minus a specified spread. Therefore, as market rates rise, we are required to sequentially increase the rates we pay our public deposits. If we are unable to maintain or grow our deposits for any reason, we may be subject to paying higher funding costs and our net interest income may decrease. OPERATIONAL RISKS We and our third-party providers have been, and expect in the future to continue to be, subject to cyber-attacks, which could cause substantial harm and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Cybersecurity risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as mobile banking, artificial intelligence and the ability to conduct instant financial transactions anywhere globally, growing geo-political threats, such as the ongoing wars in Ukraine and in the Gaza Strip, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to transmit and store sensitive data. We employ a layered defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity and identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times, especially as the threats from cyber-attacks are continuous and severe. The risk of a security breach due to a cyber-attack could increase in the future as we continue to expand our mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings, the use of the cloud for system development and hosting and internal use of internet-based products and applications. We continue to detect and identify attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, as well as attackers that respond rapidly to changes in defensive countermeasures. The most significant cyber-attack risks that we or our critical service providers may face include, but are not limited to, e-fraud, denial-of-service (DDoS), ransomware, computer intrusion and the exploitation of software zero-day vulnerabilities that might result in disruption of services and in the exposure or loss of customer or proprietary data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems or the systems of our     28 customers and extract funds from customer’s credit cards or bank accounts, including through brute force, password spraying and credential stuffing attacks directed at gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts. Denial-of-service attacks intentionally disrupt the ability of legitimate users, including customers and employees, to access networks, websites and online resources. Computer intrusion attempts either direct or through social engineering (pretext calls), supply chain compromise, email, text or voice messages, including using brand impersonation (regularly referred to as phishing, vishing, smishing and quishing), have resulted in and may continue to result in the compromise of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers, credit cards and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs to Popular if successful. The emergence of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing are further expected to exacerbate the risk of cyber-attacks. Our customer-facing platforms are also routinely attacked by threat actors aiming to gain unauthorized access to our clients’ accounts. Popular has recently implemented certain defensive measures in response to brute force attacks on one of our platforms which resulted in certain of our customers log-in credentials and information being exposed. As a result, Popular notified, as required or otherwise deemed appropriate, customers identified as affected by the incident. We have to date not experienced material losses in connection with these attacks. Cyber-security risks have also been recently exacerbated by the discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in widely distributed third party software, such as the vulnerability identified in the Apache log4j in December 2021 and in the MOVEit file transfer application in May 2023, which could affect Popular’s or any of its service provider’s systems. The increased use of remote access and third-party video conferencing solutions to enable work-from-home arrangements for employees and facilitate the use of digital channels by our customers, has also increased our exposure to cyber-attacks. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by Popular’s customers or employees. Recent events, including the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, have also illustrated increased geo-political factors and the risks related to supply-chain compromises and de-stabilizing activities linked to nation-state sponsored activity as an increasing trend to monitor actively. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, including the rise in the use of cyber-attacks as geopolitical weapons. Although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized threat-actor activity, including denial-of-service attacks, we have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of cyber-attacks. A material compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could have serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems used by us or by our clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, if personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled, misused or stolen, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling, misuse or misappropriation could include, for example, if such information were provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, by our employees or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by our employees or third parties. The extent of a particular cyber-attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber-attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber-attack to our clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Moreover, new regulations may require us to disclose information about a cybersecurity event before it has been resolved or fully investigated. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the potential harm caused by the cyber-attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Cyber-attacks could cause interruptions in our operations and result in the incurrence of significant costs, including those related to forensic analysis and legal counsel, each of which may be required to ascertain the extent of any potential harm to our customers, or employees, or damage to our information systems and any legal or regulatory obligations that may result therefrom. Any cyber incidents could also result in, among other things, increased regulatory scrutiny and adverse regulatory or civil litigation consequences. For a discussion of the guidance and rules that federal banking regulators have released or proposed regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see “Regulation and Supervision” in Part I, Item 1 — Business, included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Any or all of the foregoing factors could further increase the impact of the incident and thereby the costs and consequences of a cyber-attack. We also rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the     29 provision of information security, technology and business process services. As a result, a successful compromise or circumvention of the security of the systems of these third-party service providers could have serious negative consequences for us, including compromise of our systems, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or other negative implications identified above with respect to a cyber-attack on our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Cyber-attacks at third-party service providers are also becoming increasingly common, and, as a result, cybersecurity risks relating to our vendors have increased. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is Evertec. Certain risks particular to Evertec and our dependence on third parties are discussed under “We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure, including certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us” in the Operational Risks section of Item 1A in this Form 10-K. During 2021, we determined that, as a result of the widely reported breach of Accellion, Inc.’s File Transfer Appliance tool, which was being used at the time of such breach by a U.S.-based third-party advisory services vendor of Popular, personal information of certain Popular customers was compromised. During 2023, personal information of Popular customer data was compromised in a data breach incident that impacted MOVEit, the third-party file transfer platform used by one of our services providers. In both instances, Popular notified, as required or otherwise deemed appropriate, customers identified as affected by the incident. Although these incidents did not have a material effect on Popular or its financial condition, our networks and systems were not impacted, and our third-party service providers agreed to cover external remediation costs associated therewith, a compromise of the personal information of our customers maintained by third party vendors could result in significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss to us.The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties’ suppliers or vendors (so-called “fourth party risk”). We may not be able to effectively directly monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we expect to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate additional information security vulnerabilities or incidents. System enhancements and updates also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including risks associated with supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. Moreover, our efforts to timely mitigate vulnerabilities and manage such risks, given the rise in number and urgency of required patches and third-party software, including “zero-day vulnerabilities”, as well as the obsolescence in some of our hardware and software, may impact our day-to-day operations, the availability of our systems and delay the deployment of technology enhancements and innovation. The obsolescence in any of our hardware or software may limit our ability to mitigate vulnerabilities. If Popular’s operational systems, or those of external parties on which Popular’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of our businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail, have other significant shortcomings or are impacted by cyber-attacks, Popular could be materially and adversely affected. Unforeseen or catastrophic events, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, acts of violence or war, or the emergence of pandemics or epidemics, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Asignificant portion of our operations are located in the Caribbean and Florida, a region susceptible to hurricanes, earthquakes and other similar events. In 2017, Puerto Rico, USVI and BVI were severely impacted by Hurricanes Irma and María, which resulted in significant disruption to our operations and adversely affected our clients in these markets, and in 2022, Hurricane Fiona impacted the southwest area of Puerto Rico, adversely affecting our customers in that region. Other types of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, epidemics, man-made disasters, or acts of violence or war, or the fear that such events could occur, could also adversely impact our operations and financial results. For example, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted global health, financial markets, consumer spending and global economic conditions, and caused significant disruption to businesses worldwide, including our business and those of our customers, service providers and suppliers. Future unforeseen or catastrophic events, including new pandemic events, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to such events, could again adversely affect our operations, cause economic and market disruption, adversely     30 impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans, or affect the value of any collateral held by us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The frequency, severity and impact of future unforeseen or catastrophic events is difficult to predict. While we maintain insurance against natural disasters and other unforeseen events, including coverage for business interruption, the insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage from any such event, and there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic event could produce to the markets that we serve and the potential negative impact to economic activity. Climate change could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and that of our clients and customers. Our business and the activities and operations of our clients and customers may be disrupted by global climate change. Potential physical risks from climate change include the increase in the frequency and severity of weather events, such as storms and hurricanes, and long-term shifts in climate patterns, such as sustained higher and lower temperatures, sea level rise, heat waves and droughts, among others. Our geographic concentration in localities, including Puerto Rico, the U.S.V.I., B.V.I. and Florida, particularly susceptible to risks arising from climate change, including severe hurricanes and sea level rise, heighten the threat we face from climate change. Additionally, the impact of climate change in the markets that we operate and in other global markets may have the effect of increasing the costs or reducing the availability of insurance needed for our business operations. Climate change may also create transitional risks resulting from a shift to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks may include changes in the legal and regulatory landscape, technology, consumer sentiment and preferences, and market demands that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change. Changes in the legal and regulatory landscape may additionally increase our compliance costs. These climate-driven changes could have a material adverse impact on asset values and on our business and financial performance and those of our clients and customers. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure, including certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. Third parties provide key components of our business operations, such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is Evertec. Although the Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction narrowed the scope of services which we are dependent on Evertec to obtain and released us from exclusivity restrictions that limited our ability to engage other third-party providers of financial technology services, we are still dependent on Evertec for the provision of essential services to our business, including certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services. As a result, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of Evertec, including those relating to a breakdown or failure of Evertec’s systems or internal controls environment. Over the course of our relationship with Evertec, we have experienced interruptions and delays in key services provided by Evertec, as well as cyber events, as a result of system breakdowns, misconfigurations, human error, application obsolescence and dependency on shared infrastructure components, which have in certain cases also led to exposure of BPPR customer information. Our ability to cure legacy obsolescence in the hardware and software we procure from Evertec, as well as to effect the segregation of our shared infrastructure, is expected to be lengthy and complex, which exacerbates our exposure to resulting operational, including cybersecurity, risks. See “The transition to new financial services technology providers, and the replacement of services currently provided to us by Evertec, will be lengthy and complex” in the Operational Risks section of Item 1A in this Form 10-K below. While we select third-party vendors carefully and have increased our oversight of these relationships, we do not control the actions of our vendors. Any problems caused by these vendors, including those resulting from disruptions in the services provided, vulnerabilities in or breaches of the vendor’s systems, failure of the vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of the vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, or failure of the vendor to notify us of a reportable event in a timely manner, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business, result in potential liability to clients and customers, result in the imposition of fines, penalties or judgments by our regulators, lead to exposure of BPPR customer information or harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. The inability of our third-party service providers to timely address evolving cybersecurity threats may further exacerbate these risks. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor’s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors, when possible, could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, the use of third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. The transition to new financial services technology providers, and the replacement of services currently provided to us by Evertec, will be lengthy and complex.     31 Switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology and security services to one or more new vendors is a complex process that carries business and financial risks. The implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs), business disruption, as well as operational and cybersecurity risks. Upon the transition of all or a portion of existing services provided by Evertec to a new financial services technology provider, either (i) at the end of the term of the Second Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) and related agreements or (ii) earlier upon the termination of any service for convenience under the MSA, these transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although Evertec has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the MSA, we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner. Furthermore, we may require transition assistance from Evertec beyond the term of the MSA, delaying and lengthening any transition process away from Evertec while increasing related costs.  Under the MSA, we are able to terminate services for convenience with 180 days’ prior notice. We expect to exercise during the term of the MSA the right to terminate certain services for convenience and to transition such services to other service providers prior to the expiration of the MSA, subject to complying with the revenue minimums contemplated in the MSA and certain other conditions. In practice, in order to switch to a new provider for a particular service, we will have to commence procuring and working on a transition process for such service significantly in advance of its termination and, in any case, much earlier than the automatic renewal notice date or the expiration date of the MSA, and such process may extend beyond the current term of the MSA. Furthermore, if we are unsuccessful or decide not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Our businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to us have a significant impact on our business and operations. We are subject to extensive and evolving regulation under U.S. federal, state and Puerto Rico laws that govern almost all aspects of our operations and limit the businesses in which we may be engaged, including regulation, supervision and examination by federal, state and foreign banking authorities. These laws and regulations have expanded significantly over an extended period of time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, borrowers and depositors. Compliance with these laws and regulations has resulted, and will continue to result, in significant costs. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, we could be adversely impacted by changes in laws and regulations, or changes in the application, interpretation or enforcement of laws and regulations, that proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on certain financial services activities or impose new requirements relating to the impact of business activities on ESG concerns, the management of risks associated with those concerns and the offering of products intended to achieve ESG-related objectives. In addition, new laws or regulations could require significant system and process changes that require systems upgrades and could limit our ability to meet adoption timeframes or pursue our innovation roadmap. If we do not appropriately comply with current or future laws or regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgements, or to material regulatory restrictions on our business, which could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In 2023, the federal banking regulators proposed revisions to the U.S. capital rules and new long-term debt requirements for banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets. If finalized as proposed, the revisions to the capital rules and the new long-term debt requirements are expected to generally increase capital requirements and expenses, including interest and noninterest expense, for large banking organizations. In addition, during 2023, the federal banking regulators indicated that they are considering revisions to liquidity requirements applicable to banking organizations with $100 billion or more in light of the failures of three large banks in March and May 2023. Any such revisions could require large banks to change the size and composition of their liquidity portfolios, which could have adverse effects on net interest income and net interest margin. The pending and anticipated proposals reflect a trend of increasingly stringent regulatory requirements for banking organizations with assets of $100 billion or more, relative to smaller banking organizations, as well as less differentiation in the requirements applicable among banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets. Although Popular currently has less than $100 billion in assets, actual, anticipated or potential changes in regulatory requirements for banking organizations with at least $100 billion in assets could result in Popular deciding not to pursue growth opportunities that would result in its assets approaching or exceeding that threshold, or if Popular’s assets do exceed that threshold, a need for Popular to increase its regulatory capital,     32 issue substantial amounts of long-term debt or incur other significant expenses in order to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements. Our participation (or lack of participation) in certain governmental programs, such as the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, also exposes us to increased legal and regulatory risks. We have also been and could continue to be exposed to adverse action for the violation of applicable legal requirements or the improper conduct of our employees in connection with such loans. For example, on January 24, 2023, Popular Bank consented to the imposition of an order from the Federal Reserve Board requiring it to pay a $2.3 million civil money penalty to settle certain findings arising from Popular Bank’s approval of six Payment Protection Program loans. We are from time to time subject to information requests, investigations and other regulatory enforcement proceedings from departments and agencies of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments, including those that investigate compliance with U.S. sanctions and consumer protection laws and regulations, which may expose us to significant penalties and collateral consequences, and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on our operations. We from time-to-time self-report compliance matters to, or receive requests for information from, departments and agencies of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments, including with respect to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. For example, BPPR has in the past received requests for information, such as subpoenas and civil investigative demands from U.S. government regulators, including concerning add-ons on consumer products, real estate appraisals and residential and construction loans in Puerto Rico. BPPR has also self-identified and reported to applicable regulators compliance matters related to U.S. sanctions, as well as mortgage, credit reporting and other consumer lending practices. Incidents of this nature and investigations or examinations by governmental authorities have resulted in the past, and may in the future result, in judgments, settlements, fines, enforcement actions, penalties or other sanctions adverse to the Corporation, which could materially and adversely affect the Corporation’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. Any such settlements or orders that we enter into, or that regulatory authorities impose on us could require enhancements to our procedures and controls and entail significant operational and compliance costs. Furthermore, issues or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory settlement or action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties and enforcement actions, which could be significant. In connection with the resolution of regulatory proceedings, enforcement authorities may seek admissions of wrongdoing and, in some cases, criminal pleas, which could lead to increased exposure to private litigation, loss of clients or customers, and restrictions on offering certain products or services. In addition, responding to information-gathering requests, investigations and other regulatory proceedings, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter, could be time-consuming, expensive and divert management attention from our business. Financial services institutions such as Popular have been subject to heightened expectations and regulatory scrutiny in recent years. Our regulators’ oversight is not limited to banking and financial services laws but extends to other significant laws such as those related to anti money laundering, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy what they deem to be unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. Therefore, the outcome of any investigative or enforcement action, which may take years and be material to Popular, may be difficult to predict or estimate. Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks. If we, and our subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers, are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and penalties, and other regulatory actions, as well as governmental investigations. As a federally regulated financial institution, we must comply with regulations and economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Treasury, as well as anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including those under the Bank Secrecy Act. Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. We are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act, including the requirement to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports, that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities. In addition, as a financial institution we are required to, among other things, identify our     33 customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions. Failure by the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Corporation, including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action, including significant civil and criminal penalties. We also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements. The markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks. We have established risk-based policies and procedures and employed software designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations. Even if the appropriate controls are in place, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from blocking and rejecting all applicable transactions of our customers or our customers’ customers that may involve a sanctioned person, government or country. Any failure to detect and prevent any such transaction could result in a violation of applicable laws and regulations and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified, blocked or rejected by our policies, controls and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC. For example, during the second quarter of 2022, BPPR entered into a settlement agreement with OFAC with respect to certain transactions processed on behalf of two employees of the Government of Venezuela, in apparent violation of U.S. sanctions against Venezuela. Popular agreed to pay approximately $256,000 to settle the apparent violations, which had been self-disclosed to OFAC. There can be no assurances that any failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes, or with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, will not result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. Furthermore, if the policies, controls, and procedures of one of the Corporation’s third-party service providers, together with our third-party oversight of such providers, do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us. We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements, and if we fail to meet these requirements our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. Under regulatory capital adequacy requirements, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries must meet requirements that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital requirements and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If a financial holding company fails to maintain well-capitalized status under the regulatory framework, or is deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if it experiences certain regulatory violations, its status as a financial holding company and its related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and its ability to offer certain financial products, may be compromised and its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. The failure of any depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company to maintain well-capitalized or well-managed status could have similar consequences. In addition, federal regulators have proposed revisions to increase capital requirements for banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets. If adopted, such standards may in the future affect us. See “Our businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to us have a significant impact on our business and operations” in the Legal and Regulatory Risks section of Item 1A in this Form 10-K. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are subject to insurance up to applicable limits by the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund (“DIF”) and, as a result, BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule that increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. In addition, in November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to recover the costs to the DIF resulting from the FDIC’s use, in March 2023, of the systemic risk exception to the least-cost resolution test under the FDIA in connection with the receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The exact amount of this assessment will be determined when the FDIC terminates the related receiverships considered in the final rule. Accordingly, the final special assessment amount and collection period may change as the estimated cost is periodically adjusted or if the total amount collected varies.     34 We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums or additional assessments that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, our level of non-performing assets increases, or our risk profile changes or our capital position is impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums. Any future additional increases in FDIC premiums, assessment rates or special assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations. See the “Supervision and Regulation—FDIC Insurance” discussion in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information related to the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessments applicable to BPPR and PB. The resolution of pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, if unfavorable, could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which, in turn, could seriously harm our business prospects. We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remains high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to our legal risk, see Note 24 - “Commitments & Contingencies”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. LIQUIDITY RISKS We are subject to liquidity risks arising from market events or disruptions and instances of low investor and depositor confidence. Furthermore, actions by the rating agencies or decreases in our capital levels may have adverse effects on our liquidity and business, including by raising the cost of our obligations or affecting our ability to borrow. We must maintain adequate liquidity and funding sources to support our operations, fund customer deposit withdrawals, repay borrowings and debt, comply with our financial obligations, fund planned capital distributions and meet regulatory requirements. The Corporation’s most significant source of funds are bank deposits, including customer deposits and brokered deposits. In addition to deposits, sources of liquidity include secured borrowing arrangements, such as those with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”), unpledged securities from our investment portfolio, the capital markets and proceeds from loan sales or securitizations. Popular’s liquidity and ability to fund and operate its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, some of which are out of Popular’s control. For example, market events or disruptions, such as periods of market stress and low investor confidence in financial institutions could result in deposit withdrawals, especially to the extent those deposits are in excess of the FDIC-insured limit of $250,000. As of December 31, 2023, we had $14.6 billion of deposits (other than collateralized public funds, which represent public deposit balances from governmental entities in the U.S. and its territories, including Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, that are collateralized based on such jurisdictions’ applicable collateral requirements) in excess of the FDIC-insured limit. We may also suffer outflows of customer deposits due to competition from other banks or alternative investments. In addition, in periods of stress, we may not be able to access existing funding sources, access the capital markets or to sell or securitize loans or other assets, or to access such sources or to sell or securitize assets on favorable terms. In addition, actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings, since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher credit quality. Our credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009 and, although one of the three major rating agencies upgraded our senior unsecured rating back to “investment grade” during 2021, the remaining two rating agencies have not upgraded their current “non-investment grade” rating. The market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. If we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to complete a transaction or that the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities. If Popular is unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms, our liquidity may be adversely affected. Changes in our ratings and capital levels could affect our relationships with some creditors and limit our access to funding. For example, having negative tangible capital may impact our ability to access some sources of wholesale funding. The Federal Housing Finance Agency restricts the FHLBNY from lending to members of the FHLBNY with negative tangible capital unless the member’s primary banking regulator makes a written request to the FHLBNY to maintain access to borrowings. Both BPPR and PB have secured borrowing facilities with the FHLBNY and had outstanding exposures of $2.5 billion and $1.7 billion respectively as of December 31, 2023. Losing access to the FHLBNY borrowing facilities could adversely impact liquidity at the banking subsidiaries. Additionally, if BPPR or PB cease to be well-capitalized, the FDIA and regulations adopted thereunder would restrict their ability to accept brokered deposits and limit the rate of interest payable on deposits.     35 Our banking subsidiaries also have recourse obligations under certain agreements with third parties, including servicing and custodial agreements, that include ratings covenants. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require us to engage a substitute fund custodian and increase collateral levels securing recourse obligations. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $27.1 million on December 31, 2023. While management expects that we would be able to meet any additional collateral requirements if and when needed, the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity resources and impact our results of operations. As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity. As a bank holding company, we depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs, including to capitalize our subsidiaries. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings, dividend history, and capital position. Based on its current financial condition, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient income and free cash flow to make dividend payments to us may affect our ability to fund our cash needs, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operation or capital position. Such failure could also affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock. We have in the past suspended dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock during times of economic uncertainty, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to declare dividends to our stockholders in any future periods. An impact on the tangible capital levels of our operating subsidiaries, could also limit the amount of capital we may upstream to the holding company. Tangible capital levels have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the impact of rapidly rising interest rates on investment securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. For a discussion of risks related to changes in interest rates, see “Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely impact our financial condition, including our investment portfolio, since a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We also depend on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to pay debt service on outstanding debt and to repay maturing debt. Our ability to declare such dividends would be subject to regulatory requirements and could require the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. STRATEGIC RISKS Potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face, and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints. To the extent permitted by our applicable regulators, we may pursue strategic acquisition opportunities. Acquiring other businesses, however, involves various risks, including potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, potential disruption to our business, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company. If we pay a premium over book or market value in connection with an acquisition, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, acquiring loan portfolios involves various risks. When acquiring loan portfolios, management makes assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In estimating the extent of the losses, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, however, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be required, which would negatively affect our results of operations. Finally, certain acquisitions by financial institutions, including us, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated     36 with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have embarked on a broad-based multi-year, technological and business process transformation. The failure to achieve the goals of the transformation project, the inability to maintain project expenses within current estimates or delays in executing our plans to implement the transformation project, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cause reputational harm. The Corporation has embarked on a broad-based multi-year, technological and business process transformation. Our technology and business transformation will be a significant priority for the Corporation over the next two years and beyond. We expect the expenses tied to this transformation project, which will continue through at least 2025, to result in an enhanced digital experience for our clients, as well as better technology and more efficient processes for our employees. To execute the transformation project, we plan to expand our digital capabilities, modernize our technology foundation, and implement agile and efficient business processes across the entire company. We may not succeed in executing the transformation project, may fail to properly estimate cost of the same, or may experience delays in executing our plans, which may in turn cause the Corporation to incur costs exceeding our current estimates or disrupt our operations, including our technological services to our customers, or fall short of our projected earnings targets driven by these efforts. To the extent that these disruptions persist over time and/or recur, this could negatively impact our competitive position, require additional expenditures, and/or harm our relationships with our customers and thus may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cause reputational harm. We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, in which we compete on the basis of a number of factors, including customer service, quality and variety of products and services, price, interest rates on loans and deposits, innovation, technology, ease of use, reputation, and transaction execution. While our main competition continues to come from other Puerto Rico banks and financial institutions, we face increased competition from non-Puerto Rico institutions as emerging technologies and the growth of e-commerce have significantly reduced geographic barriers. These technologies have also made it easier for non-depositary institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and allowed non-traditional financial service providers and technology companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions and services. Increased competition could create pressure to lower prices, fees, commissions or credit standards on our products and services, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Increased competition could also create pressure to raise interest rates on deposits, which could also impact our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to meet constant technological changes and react quickly to meet new industry standards, including as a result of our continued dependence on Evertec, we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. To compete effectively, we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products and services to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors, including technology companies and other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. Although the Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction eliminated certain provisions of a previous Master Services Agreement with Evertec that required us to use Evertec exclusively to develop and implement new or enhanced products and services, and is expected to improve Popular’s ability to manage and control the development of the customer channels supported by the assets acquired as part of the Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction (the “Acquired Assets”), Popular expects that it will continue to depend on Evertec’s technology services to operate and control current products and services and to implement future products and services, making our success dependent on Evertec’s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner. Our ability to enhance our customer channels is also dependent on Evertec timely delivering the core application programming interfaces (“Core APIs”) that meet BPPR’s requirements, which Evertec has committed to develop under the MSA. The Core APIs are necessary for BPPR to connect future enhancements to the Acquired Assets to existing Evertec core applications. Some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than Evertec, serve a greater number of clients than Evertec, and may have better technological capabilities and product offerings than Evertec. Furthermore, financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers’ compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry     37 requirements, and in most cases such costs are borne by the technology provider. Because of our contractual relationship with Evertec, and because Popular is the sole customer of certain of Evertec’s services and products, we have in the past borne the full cost of such developments and modifications and may be required to do so in the future, subject to the terms of the MSA. Moreover, the terms, speed, scalability, and functionality of certain of Evertec’s technology services are not competitive when compared to offerings from its competitors. Evertec’s failure to sufficiently invest in and upscale its technology and services infrastructure to meet the rapidly changing technology demands of our industry may result in us being unable to meet customer expectations and attract or retain customers. Furthermore, Evertec’s strategy and investments may also be refocused away from Popular towards other strategic initiatives as a result of the Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce Popular’s revenues, place us in a competitive disadvantage and significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While the closing of the Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction narrowed the scope of services which we are dependent on Evertec to obtain and released us from exclusivity restrictions that limited our ability to engage other third-party providers of financial technology services, it also resulted in extensions of certain existing commercial agreements with Evertec and, as a result, have prolonged the duration of our exposure to the risks presented by Evertec’s technological capabilities and its failures to enhance its products and services and otherwise meet evolving demands. We may also be exposed to heightened business risks in connection with our dependency on Evertec with respect to BPPR’s merchant acquiring business, which exclusivity was extended until 2035, and with respect to the ATH Network, which commitment BPPR extended until 2030, in light of the pace of technology changes and competition in the payments industry. The ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for qualified candidates is intense and has increased recently as a result of a tighter labor market. Increased competition may lead to difficulties in attracting or retaining qualified employees, which may, in turn, lead to significant challenges in the execution of our business strategies and have an adverse effect on the quality of the service we provide to the customers and communities we serve. Such challenges could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. In addition, increased competition may lead to higher compensation packages and more flexible work arrangements. We may also be required to hire employees outside of our market areas for certain positions that require specific expertise, which could result in employment and tax compliance-related expenses, challenges and risks. In addition, flexible work arrangements, such as remote or hybrid work models, have led to other workplace challenges, including fewer opportunities for face-to-face interactions or to promote a cohesive corporate culture and heightened cybersecurity, information security and other operational risks. Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is also impacted by regulatory limitations on our compensation practices, such as clawback requirements of incentive compensation, which may not affect other institutions with which we compete for talent. The scope and content of regulators’ policies on executive compensation continue to develop and are likely to continue evolving. Such policies and limitations on our compensation practices could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented senior leaders in support of our long-term strategy. OTHER RISKS An impairment of our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $804 million, $1 billion and $102 million, respectively, of goodwill, net deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets, including capitalized software costs, recorded on our balance sheet. Under GAAP, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in Popular’s stock price related to a deterioration in global or local economic conditions, declines in our market capitalization, reduced future earnings estimates, and interest rate changes. The goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. The determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The analysis considers all sources of     38 taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax-planning strategies. Changes in these factors may affect the realizability of our deferred tax assets in our Puerto Rico and U.S. operations. If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We could experience unexpected losses if the estimates or assumptions we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or differ materially from actual results. In preparing our financial statements pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that are often based on subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. For example, we use estimates and assumptions to determine our allowance for credit losses, our liability for contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, such as debt securities, loans held for sale, MSRs, intangible assets and deferred tax assets. If such estimates or assumptions are incorrect or differ materially from actual results, we could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could be significant. For further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the MD&A section of this Form 10-K"
5,BPOP,POPULAR INC,2023-03-01,"of this Form 10-K.We also depend on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to pay debt service on outstanding debt and to repay maturing debt. We have $300 million of notes that mature on September 14, 2023. If we were unable to refinance these notes, we could have to declare extraordinary dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to repay such notes. Our ability to declare such dividends would be subject to regulatory requirements and could require the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. STRATEGIC RISKS Potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face, and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints. To the extent permitted by our applicable regulators, we may pursue strategic acquisition opportunities.

OTHER RISKS An impairment of our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $827 million, $954 million and $94 million, respectively, of goodwill, net deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. Under GAAP, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The analysis considers all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax-planning strategies. Changes in these factors may affect the realizability of our deferred tax assets in our Puerto Rico and U.S. operations. If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We could experience unexpected losses if the estimates or assumptions we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or differ materially from actual results. In preparing our financial statements pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that are often based on subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. For example, we use estimates                           37 and assumptions to determine our allowance for credit losses, our liability for contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, such as debt securities, loans held for sale, MSRs, intangible assets and deferred tax assets. If such estimates or assumptions are incorrect or differ materially from actual results, we could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could be significant.For further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the MD&A section of this Form 10-K"
7,BPOP,POPULAR INC,2022-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We, like other financial institutions, face risks inherent to our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.The risks described in this report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or that are generally applicable to all financial institutions, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital position.SummaryThe risk factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position include:RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly disrupted the global economy and the markets in which we operate, which adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operation.  A significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where economic and fiscal challenges have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us. Further deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations. Legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS The fiscal and economic challenges of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our portfolio of government securities and our loans to government entities in such jurisdictions, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action in such jurisdictions. A reduction in Puerto Rico government deposits could also adversely affect our net interest income.21  Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time receive requests for information from departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments, including those that investigate compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements. Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition. As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Our business is susceptible to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. Reforms to and uncertainty regarding the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations. Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by applicable regulators. We are subject to risk related to our own credit rating; actions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the cost of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements in the future and may have other adverse effects on our business. We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. The resolution of pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, if unfavorable, could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks. If we, and our subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers, are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and penalties, and other regulatory actions, as well as governmental investigations. RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These cybersecurity risks have been heightened by the increase on our employees’ remote work capabilities and in the use of digital channels by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. Unforeseen or catastrophic events, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, acts of violence or war, or the emergence of pandemics or epidemics, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Climate change could also have a material adverse impact on our business operations and that of our clients and customers. RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS Potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face, and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints.RISKS RELATING TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERTEC We are dependent on EVERTEC, Inc. for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. Popular faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. If EVERTEC, Inc. is unable to meet constant technological changes and react quickly to meet new industry standards, we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. The transition to new financial services technology providers, and the replacement of services currently provided to us by EVERTEC, Inc., will be lengthy and complex. The value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, Inc., and the revenues we derive from EVERTEC, Inc., could be materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with EVERTEC, Inc. or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term. The EVERTEC Transaction (as defined below) could also result in a material reduction in the value of22 our ownership interest in EVERTEC, Inc., will eliminate our rights to nominate directors to EVERTEC, Inc.’s board of directors and is expected to result in the elimination of the income we report from this investment. The proposed EVERTEC Transaction is subject to closing conditions and subjects Popular to additional risks. RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES Dividends on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or Preferred Stock without selling their shares. Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. The above summary is subject in its entirety to the discussion of the risk factors set forth below. Risk Factors
RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS and economic ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly disrupted the global economy and the markets in which we operate, which adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operation. Its continued impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility in the financial markets, significantly increased unemployment levels worldwide and decreased consumer confidence and commercial activity generally, including in the markets in which we do business, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures. The COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to higher and more volatile credit loss expense and potential for increased charge-offs; loan and credit ratings downgrades; credit deterioration and defaults in many industries; a significant increase in the volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity markets; and a decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities and other investment securities, which led to decreased net interest income. In response to the pandemic, governments across the world, including the governments of Puerto Rico (our primary market), the United States Virgin Islands (“USVI”) and the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”), as well as state governments in the United States mainland, including New York, New Jersey and Florida, where Popular Bank (“PB”) has branches, initially ordered the temporary closure of many businesses, implemented mandatory curfews and the institution of social distancing, shelter in place and other health and safety requirements. Although many of these restrictive measures have been eased or lifted, certain restrictive measures remain in place and additional restrictive measures may be implemented in the future as a result of a resurgence in the spread of the virus or new strains of the virus. The restrictions imposed by governments in response to the outbreak caused significant disruption to economic activity and an increase in unemployment in the markets in which we operate, including Puerto Rico, which has been facing significant fiscal and economic challenges for over a decade. For more information, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) section in the Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Further deterioration of the Puerto Rico, USVI, BVI and the broader U.S. economy would be expected to adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to comply with their financial obligations and adversely impact demand for our products and services. The disruption in economic activity could also adversely affect the financial condition of government entities in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI to which we have exposure.The COVID-19 pandemic also significantly disrupted our operations and negatively impacted our business and financial condition. Many of BPPR’s and PB’s branches were temporarily closed in response to the pandemic. Currently, all BPPR’s and PB’s branches are operating, subject to measures to preserve the health and safety of our employees and customers. To protect the health and safety of our workforce, we have facilitated a significant portion of our workforce to work remotely, which further exposes the Corporation to heightened risks with respect to cybersecurity, information security and other operational incidents, as well as our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls. Furthermore, although we have implemented a remote work protocol for many of our workers and instituted health and safety measures to protect employees that cannot work remotely, a disruption to our ability to deliver financial products or services to, or interact with, our customers could also result in losses or increased operational costs, regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions, or harm our reputation.23 Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, the Corporation implemented temporary measures to provide financial relief to customers through programs such as payment moratoriums, suspensions of foreclosures and other collection activity, as well as waivers of certain fees and service charges. By the end of the third quarter of 2020, the Corporation had reinstated the imposition of these fees and service charges and resumed its delinquent loan collection efforts. The Federal Government also approved several economic stimulus measures, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic, including guaranteeing loans to small and medium-sized businesses through the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). However, there can be no assurance that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to offset the pandemic’s economic impact. In addition, moratoriums imposed by Federal or state law or provided voluntarily by the Corporation may limit our ability to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition of certain of our customers and the credit quality of our loan portfolio until borrowers that benefit from such moratoriums are required to resume loan repayments. Such moratorium and stimulus programs have also imposed significant operational burdens on the Corporation, which also heighten the risk of operational incidents, including fraud and undetected errors. Our participation (or lack of participation) in certain governmental programs enacted in response to the pandemic, including the PPP, could further result in reputational harm, litigation and regulatory and other government action against the Corporation. For example, the Corporation may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Corporation regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications under the PPP and may be exposed to adverse action for the improper conduct of its employees in connection with such loans. Furthermore, the Corporation may also have credit risk with respect to PPP loans if the SBA determines that there have been deficiencies in the way a PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Corporation, and denies its liability under the guaranty, reduces the amount of the guaranty or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seeks recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Corporation.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition (including our provision for credit losses, net charge offs, regulatory capital, liquidity ratios and the liquidity of the bank holding company and its operating subsidiaries), as well as the operations of our clients, customers, service providers and suppliers, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict at this time, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the appearance of new strains of the virus and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, such as the speed and effectiveness of vaccination programs and the nature and length of economic stimulus initiatives. To the extent the pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section. A significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where economic and fiscal challenges have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us. Our credit exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which accounted as of December 31, 2021 for approximately 84% of our total assets, 85% of our deposits and 82% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. As such, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets and asset values in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico entered recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (GNP) thereafter contracted in real terms every year between fiscal years 2007 and 2018 (inclusive), except fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the “Planning Board”) estimates, published in March 2021, the Commonwealth’s real GNP increased by 1.8% in fiscal year 2019 due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and María. However, the planning Board estimates that the Commonwealth’s real GNP decreased by approximately 3.2% in fiscal year 2020 due primarily to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same. The Planning Board projected that the negative effects of COVID-19 would continue through fiscal year 2021, resulting in a contraction in real GNP of approximately -2%, followed by 0.8% GNP growth in the current fiscal year.  The Commonwealth’s government has also been facing significant fiscal challenges that may have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The historical structural imbalance between revenues and expenditures, on the one hand, and unfunded legacy pension obligations, on the other hand, coupled with the Commonwealth’s inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on and eventually seeking to restructure their debts and for the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) in June 2016. PROMESA, among other things, established a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the “Oversight Board”) with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provided to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For a discussion of risks related to the Corporation’s credit24 exposure to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, see the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&A section of the Annual Report on this Form 10-K.The credit quality of BPPR’s loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The Commonwealth’s prolonged recession resulted in limited loan demand and in an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. The measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the future could affect many of our individual customers and customers’ businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us. Fiscal adjustments have resulted and may continue to result in significant resistance from local politicians and other stakeholders, which may lead to social and political instability. Any reduction in consumer spending because of these issues may also adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues.If global or local economic conditions worsen, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis, including completing an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, those adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are outside of our control. Under such circumstances, we could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.Further deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations.The value of properties in some of the markets we serve, in particular in Puerto Rico, declined during the past decade as a result of adverse economic conditions, although the value of properties in some of these markets have recently showed signs of recovery. The deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction loan portfolios resulted in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 29%, 25% and 2%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans secured by real estate, mortgage loans and construction loans, respectively. Substantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is in Puerto Rico, the USVI, the BVI or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. General economic conditions in Puerto Rico (as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic) and fiscal reforms aimed at addressing the current fiscal crisis could cause a further deterioration of the value of the real estate collateral securing our loan portfolios.A further deterioration of the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would require increases in our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk section of the MD&A included in the Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.Popular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal, New York and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal, New York or Puerto Rico laws or regulations (or laws and regulations in other jurisdictions in which we may do business, such as California) could have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on Popular. Furthermore, the Commonwealth has enacted various reforms in response to its fiscal and economic problems and is likely to implement additional reforms as part of its obligations under PROMESA. RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESSThe fiscal and economic challenges of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our portfolio of government securities and our loans to government entities in such jurisdictions, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers25 who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action in such jurisdictions. A reduction in Puerto Rico government deposits could also adversely affect our net interest income.We have direct and indirect lending and investment exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its public corporations and municipalities. A deterioration of the Commonwealth’s fiscal and economic condition, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or actions taken by the Commonwealth government or the Oversight Board to address Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis, could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our Puerto Rico government obligations, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action, resulting in losses to us. At December 31, 2021, our direct exposure to Puerto Rico government obligations was limited to obligations from various municipalities and amounted to $367 million. In addition, at December 31, 2021, the Corporation had $275 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental. For additional discussion of the Corporation’s exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&A section of the Annual Report on this Form 10-K.  BPPR’s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the Puerto Rico government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis and the ongoing debt restructuring proceedings under PROMESA. Similarly, BPPR’s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs. Furthermore, BPPR has a significant amount of deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships. A significant portion of the Commonwealth’s deposits are expected be used by the Commonwealth pursuant to the Plan of Adjustment for the Commonwealth confirmed by the PROMESA Title III Court, which is expected to become effective on or about March 15, 2022. While a significant decrease in these deposits should not materially affect our liquidity since such deposits are collateralized, a significant decrease in the amount of such deposits could adversely affect our net interest income. BPPR also has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure to USVI government entities. At December 31, 2021, BPPR’s direct exposure to USVI instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately $70 million, of which $68 million is outstanding. The USVI has been experiencing several fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. For additional information on the Corporation’s exposure to the USVI government, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&A section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time receive requests for information from departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments, including those that investigate compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time self-report compliance matters to, or receive requests for information from, departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments, including with respect to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. For example, BPPR has in the past received subpoenas and other requests for information from the departments of the U.S. government that investigate mortgage-related conduct, mainly concerning real estate appraisals and residential and construction loans in Puerto Rico. BPPR has also self-identified and reported to applicable regulators matters with respect to mortgage and other consumer lending practices. Incidents of this nature and investigations or examinations by governmental authorities may result in judgments, settlements, fines, enforcement actions, penalties or other sanctions adverse to the Corporation which could materially and adversely affect the Corporation’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements.Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. We have furthermore retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit 26 risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December 31, 2021, we serviced $0.7 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2021, we repurchased approximately $19 million in mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2021, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $12 million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property. Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.In connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and they relate to, among other things, compliance with laws and regulations, underwriting standards, the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan. A loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan, and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market’s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting from representations and warranty violations on specific portfolios. At December 31, 2021, our reserve for estimated losses from representation and warranty arrangements amounted to $839 thousand, which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition. Nonetheless, we do not expect any such losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity.We are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include declaring dividends to our shareholders of our common stock, capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. Based on its current financial condition, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient income and free cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operation and capital position and may affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock. Additionally, adverse macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in restrictions from regulators on dividends and repurchases of our common stock, which could limit the capital we return to our shareholders. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC’s DIF and, as a result, BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, our level of non-performing assets increases, or our risk profile changes or our capital position is impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums. Any future increases or special assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations. See the27 “Supervision and Regulation—FDIC Insurance” discussion in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information related to the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessments applicable to BPPR and PB.  Our business is susceptible to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. Reforms to and uncertainty regarding the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates. Since a high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes in rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates can have a material impact on our results of operations and the values of our assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Interest rates are also highly sensitive to many factors over which we have no control and which we may not be able to anticipate adequately, including general economic conditions and the monetary and tax policies of various governmental bodies, particularly the Federal Reserve. For a discussion of the Corporation’s interest rate sensitivity, please refer to the “Risk Management” section of the MD&A of the Annual Report on this Form 10-K. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the LIBOR administration announced that it would consider continuing publication of certain US dollar LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023, subject to applicable regulations. In response to this announcement, Federal regulators issued a statement that, among other things, encouraged all financial institutions to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years. As a result of this transition, interest rates on floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments held by the Corporation and tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. Any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully implement benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and effectively establish transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could also result in disruption in the financial markets. Further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates. Regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is difficult to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. The Corporation has adopted fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments and is implementing alternative rates for the origination of new loans. However, certain contractual documents governing the Corporation’s LIBOR-linked financial instruments may not provide effective fallback language in the event LIBOR rates cease to be published, which may present the Corporation with legal and regulatory risk if, for example, the Corporation is unable to amend these financial instruments prior to such cessation. If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations.As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $ 720 million, $657 million and $15 million, respectively, of goodwill, net deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.  Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in Popular’s stock price related to macroeconomic conditions in the global market as well as the weakness in the Puerto Rico economy and fiscal situation, declines in our market capitalization, reduced future earnings estimates, continuance of a low interest rate environment and the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may exacerbate these and other circumstances, could in turn result in an impairment of goodwill. The goodwill impairment evaluation28 process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. The determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The analysis considers all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax-planning strategies. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the expected profitability of our businesses may affect the realizability of our deferred tax assets in our Puerto Rico and U.S. operations. If we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of the goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by applicable regulators.Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the other federal banking agencies and the SEC, to adopt rules prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including Popular, PNA, BPPR and PB). The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. Compliance with such revised rules may substantially affect the way in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. In addition, in 2015, the SEC proposed rules directing national securities exchanges and associations to establish listing standards requiring companies to adopt policies that require executive officers to pay back incentive-based compensation that they were awarded erroneously. Those rules have not been adopted. In October 2021, the SEC reopened the comment period on these proposed rules. For a more detailed discussion of these proposed rules, see the “Supervision and Regulation—Incentive Compensation” section in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of Popular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate key employees. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long-term strategy. We are subject to risk related to our own credit rating; actions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the cost of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements in the future and may have other adverse effects on our business. Actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher credit quality. Our credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and, although one of the three major rating agencies upgraded our senior unsecured rating back to “investment grade” during 2021, the remaining two rating agencies have not upgraded their current “non-investment grade” rating. The market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities. In addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect our relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based on our29 below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. Our banking subsidiaries have servicing, licensing and custodial agreements with third parties that include ratings covenants. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require us to engage a substitute fund custodian and increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $32 million at December 31, 2021. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment grade. We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If a financial holding company fails to maintain well-capitalized status under the regulatory framework, or is deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if it experiences certain regulatory violations, its status as a financial holding company and its related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and its ability to offer certain financial products, may be compromised and its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published Basel IV in December 2017. Basel IV significantly revises the Basel capital framework, and the impact on us will depend on the way the revisions are implemented in the U.S. See the “Supervision and Regulation – Capital Adequacy” discussion in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information related to the Basel III Capital Rules and Basel IV. The resolution of pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, if unfavorable, could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to our legal risk, see Note 24 - “Commitments & Contingencies”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on this Form 10-K. Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks. If we, and our subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers, are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and penalties, and other regulatory actions, as well as governmental investigations.As a federally regulated financial institution, we must comply with regulations and economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Treasury, as well as anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including those under the Bank Secrecy Act.  Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, and30 also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. We are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act, including the requirement to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports, that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities. In addition, as a financial institution we are required to, among other things, identify our customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions. Failure by the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Corporation, including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action, including significant civil and criminal penalties. We can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements. The markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks.We have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations. With respect to OFAC regulations and economic and trade sanction programs, these policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctioned-country and person’s involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying and where applicable, blocking and rejecting transactions of our customers or our customers’ customers that may involve a sanctioned person, government or country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified, blocked or rejected by our policies, controls and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC. There can be no assurances that any failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes, or with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, will not result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. Furthermore, if the policies, controls, and procedures of one of the Corporation’s third-party service providers do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us, and, in the case of EVERTEC, could adversely affect the value of our investment in EVERTEC. RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONSWe are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These cybersecurity risks have been heightened by the increase on our employees’ remote work capabilities and in the use of digital channels by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct instant financial transactions anywhere globally, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to transmit and store sensitive data. We employ a layered defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity and identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times, especially as the threats from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe. The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future as we continue to expand our mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and Popular’s internal use of internet-based products and applications. We continue to detect and identify attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, as well as attackers that respond rapidly to changes in defensive countermeasures. We have been the target of phishing attacks in the past, targeting both our customers and employees through brand and email impersonation, that have compromised the email accounts of certain of our customers and employees. We continually monitor and address those vulnerabilities and continue to enhance our security measures to detect and prevent such incidents, while enhancing employee and customer trainings and awareness campaigns. There can be no assurances, however, that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future. Furthermore, increased use of remote access and third-party video conferencing solutions during the COVID-1931 pandemic, to enable work-from-home arrangements for employees, and facilitating the use of digital channels by our customers, has increased our exposure to cyber attacks. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by Popular’s customers or employees. The most significant cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service (DDoS), ransomware, computer intrusion and the exploitation of software zero-day vulnerabilities that might result in disruption of services and in the exposure or loss of customer or proprietary data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems or the systems of our customers and extract funds from customer’s credit cards or bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the compromise of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers, credit cards and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Additionally, cyber-security risks have been recently exacerbated by the discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in widely distributed third party software, as seen in the Apache log4j vulnerability reported in December 2021, which could affect Popular’s or any of its service provider’s systems. Recent events have also illustrated increased geo-political factors and the risks related to supply-chain compromises and de-stabilizing activities linked to nation-state sponsored activity as an increasing trend to monitor actively. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, including the rise in the use of cyber-attacks as geopolitical weapons, as well as the expanding use of digital channels for banking, such as mobile banking and other technology-based products and services used by us and our customers. Although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized threat-actor activity, we have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of any cyber-attacks. A successful compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could have serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems used by us or by our clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, if personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled, misused or stolen, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to our clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the potential harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the impact of the incident and thereby the costs and consequences of a cyber attack. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see “Regulation and Supervision” in Part I, Item 1 — Business, included in this Form 10-K. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. We also rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information security, technology and business process services. As a result, a successful compromise or circumvention of the security of the systems of these third-party service providers could have serious negative consequences for us, including misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or other negative implications identified above with respect to a cyber-attack on our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed under “Risks Relating to our Relationship with Evertec”. During 2021, we determined that, as a result of the widely reported breach of Accellion, Inc.’s File Transfer Appliance tool, which was being used at the time of such breach by a U.S.-based third-party advisory services vendor of Popular, personal information of certain Popular customers was compromised. As a result, Popular notified, as required or otherwise deemed appropriate, customers identified as affected by the incident. Although we are not aware of fraudulent activity in connection with this incident, Popular’s networks and systems were not impacted, and our third-party service provider agreed to cover external remediation costs associated with the incident. A compromise of the personal information of our customers maintained by third party vendors could result in significant regulatory consequences, reputational32 damage and financial loss to us. The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties’ suppliers or vendors (so-called “fourth party risk”). We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including risks associated with supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. Moreover, our ability to timely mitigate vulnerabilities and manage such risks, given the rise in number of required patches and third-party software “zero-day vulnerabilities”, may impact our day-to-day operations, the availability of our systems and delay the deployment of technology enhancements and innovation. If Popular’s operational systems, or those of external parties on which Popular’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of our businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, Popular could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed below under “Risks Relating to Our Relationship with EVERTEC.” While we select third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions and we may also be subject to long-term contracts with certain of these vendors (including EVERTEC) that, for example, limit our ability to replace these vendors. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by a vendor, breaches of a vendor’s systems, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor’s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors, when possible, could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. In addition, the assessment and management by financial institutions of the risks associated with third party vendors have been subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with our oversight of third-party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities. Our failure to properly manage risks associated to our third-party relationships could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by our regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. Unforeseen or catastrophic events, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, acts of violence or war, or the emergence of pandemics or epidemics, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Climate change could also have a material adverse impact on our business operations and that of our clients and customers.The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events in the markets in which we do business, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, acts of violence or war, or the emergence of pandemics could cause a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our operations are located in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI, a region susceptible to hurricanes, earthquakes and other similar events. For example, in 2017, our operations in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI were significantly disrupted by the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In January 2020, Puerto Rico was impacted by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake which caused island-wide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island. Future natural disasters33 can again cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We maintain insurance against natural disasters including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic natural disaster could produce to the markets that we serve and the potential negative impact to economic activity. Further, future natural disasters in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may further adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. Man-made disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other events connected with the regions in which we operate could have similar effects. The frequency, severity and impact of future hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics, epidemics and other similar events are difficult to predict. Any actual or threatened war, terrorist activity, geopolitical events or other acts of violence, both in the markets in which we do business or globally, could result in economic disruption, heightened volatility in financial markets and diminished consumer, business and investor confidence, among others, adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operation. Furthermore, we operate in regions, countries and communities where our business and the activities and operations of our clients and customers may be further disrupted by global climate change. Potential physical risks from climate change include the increase in the frequency and severity of weather events, such as storms and hurricanes, and long-term shifts in climate patterns, such as sustained higher and lower temperatures, sea level rise, heat waves and droughts, among others. These events may cause disruptions in our business and operations and the destruction of our properties and assets. Furthermore, these severe weather events may also disrupt the businesses and operations of our clients and customers and damage the properties and assets of our borrowers, adversely affecting the financial condition of our clients and customers and the value of any collateral held by us. Losses resulting from these disasters and severe weather events may make it more difficult for our borrowers to timely repay their loans. If these events occur, we may experience a decrease in the value of our loan portfolio and our revenue, and may incur in additional operational expenses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the impact of climate change in the markets that we operate and in other global markets may have the effect of increasing the costs or reducing the availability of insurance needed for our business operations. Climate change may also create transitional risks resulting from a shift to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks, which we may be subject to, may include changes in the legal and regulatory landscape, technology, consumer sentiment and preferences, and market demands that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change. These climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on asset values and on our business and financial performance and those of our clients and customers. risks related to acquisition transactions Potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face, and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints.To the extent permitted by our applicable regulators, we may pursue strategic acquisition opportunities. Acquiring other banks or businesses, however, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, potential disruption to our business, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company. If in connection with an acquisition we pay a premium over book or market value, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, acquiring loan portfolios involves various risks. When acquiring loan portfolios, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In estimating the extent of the losses, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, however, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolios, which would negatively affect our operating results. Finally, certain acquisitions by financial institutions, including us, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new34 regulatory issues we have. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. RISKS RELATING TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERTECWe are dependent on EVERTEC for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.In connection with the sale of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a long-term Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “Current MSA”) with EVERTEC, pursuant to which we agreed to receive from EVERTEC, on an exclusive basis, certain core banking and financial transaction processing and information technology and security services. The term of the Current MSA extends until September 30, 2025. Under the Current MSA, we also granted EVERTEC a right of first refusal over certain services or products and development projects related to the services thereunder provided. We also entered into several other agreements, generally coterminous with the Current MSA, pursuant to which BPPR agreed to sponsor EVERTEC as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations, agreed to certain exclusivity and non-solicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services (the “Current ISO Agreement”), and agreed to support the ATH brand and network (the “Current ATH Agreement”), among other matters. As a result, we are dependent on EVERTEC for the provision of essential services to our business, including our core banking business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that EVERTEC will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing, security and technology services. As a result, our relationship with EVERTEC exposes us to operational, cybersecurity and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of our agreements with EVERTEC, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of EVERTEC, including those relating to a breakdown or failure of EVERTEC’s systems or internal controls environment, including as a result of security breaches or attacks, employee error or malfeasance, system breakdowns, vulnerabilities, obsolescence or otherwise. Over the term of the Current MSA, we have experienced various interruptions and delays in key services provided by EVERTEC, as well as cyber breaches, as a result of system breakdowns, misconfigurations and instances of application obsolescence, which has led in the past to exposure of BPPR customer information. There can be no assurances that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future because of the aforementioned causes. The continuance or increase in service delays or interruptions, vulnerabilities in EVERTEC’s information systems, or cyberattacks to, or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, expose us to regulatory, legal and compliance risk and damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding our cybersecurity risks, refer to the “We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business” risk factor. Our ability to recover from EVERTEC for breach of the Current MSA, including the failure to meet the service levels provided for therein, may not fully compensate us for the damages we may suffer as a result of such breach. As previously announced and as described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022, on February 24, 2022, we and BPPR entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to purchase from EVERTEC certain information technology and related assets used by EVERTEC to service certain of BPPR’s key channels (the “Acquired Assets”) under the Current MSA and assume certain liabilities relating thereto (the “EVERTEC Transaction”). Upon consummation of the EVERTEC Transaction (the “EVERTEC Transaction Closing”), the parties to the EVERTEC Transaction will enter into certain commercial agreements, including an amendment and restatement of the Current MSA in substantially the form attached to the Purchase Agreement (the “Second A&R MSA”). A copy of the form of the Second A&R MSA is included in Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022. The term of the Second A&R MSA will expire on September 30, 2028, which would be a three-year extension of the term of the Current MSA. In addition, upon the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, the term of the Current ISO Agreement will be extended for a ten-year period and the term of the Current ATH Agreement will be extended for a five-year period. These extensions would prolong the duration of time during which we will be exposed to operational, cybersecurity and business risks arising out of our relationship with EVERTEC. However, we would no longer be subject to the exclusivity obligations of the Current MSA, nor would EVERTEC have the right of first refusal with respect to certain services or products and development projects that it has under the Current MSA. As a result, we expect that the scope of services for which we are dependent on EVERTEC will decrease following the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, subject to the successful completion of the EVERTEC Transaction and the risk factors related thereto (as discussed below).35  Popular faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. If EVERTEC is unable to meet constant technological changes and react quickly to meet new industry standards, we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.We operate in a highly competitive environment in which we must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of technological advances. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. We compete on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, innovation, price, ease of use, reputation and transaction execution. To compete effectively, we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products and services to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors, including technology companies and other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. These enhancements and new products and services require the delivery of technology services by EVERTEC pursuant to the Current MSA, making our success dependent on EVERTEC’s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner. This dependence will continue following the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, but the completion of the EVERTEC Transaction is expected to improve our ability to manage and control the development of the customer channels supported by the Acquired Assets and would eliminate certain provisions of the Current MSA that currently require us to use EVERTEC to develop and implement new or enhanced products and services, including with respect to such customer channels. Some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than EVERTEC and that may have better technological capabilities and product offerings. Furthermore, financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers’ compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, and in most cases such costs are borne by the technology provider. Because of our contractual relationship with EVERTEC, however, we have in the past borne the full cost of such developments and modifications and may be required to do so in the future, subject to the terms of the Current MSA (or if the Evertec Transaction Closing occurs, the Second A&R MSA).  Moreover, the terms, speed, scalability and functionality of certain of EVERTEC’s technology services are not competitive when compared to offerings from its competitors. Evertec’s failure to sufficiently invest in and upscale its technology and services infrastructure to meet the rapidly changing technology demands of our industry may result in us being unable to meet customer expectations and attract or retain customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce Popular’s revenues, place us in a competitive disadvantage and significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While the EVERTEC Transaction Closing is expected to result in a narrowing of the scope of services which we are dependent on EVERTEC to obtain and in releasing us from exclusivity restrictions that limit our ability to engage other third-party providers of financial technology services, it would also result in extensions of certain existing commercial agreements with EVERTEC and, as a result, would prolong the duration of our exposure to the risks presented by EVERTEC’s technological capabilities and its failures to enhance its products and services and otherwise meet evolving demands.  The transition to new financial services technology providers, and the replacement of services currently provided to us by EVERTEC, will be lengthy and complex.Switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology and security services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks, even where such a switch can be accomplished without violating our contractual obligations to EVERTEC. The implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs), business disruption, as well as operational and cybersecurity risks. Upon the transition of all or a portion of existing services provided by EVERTEC to a new financial services technology provider, either (i) at the end of the term of the Current MSA (or, following the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, the Second A&R MSA) and related agreements or (ii) earlier upon the occurrence of an early termination thereunder (or, following the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, upon the termination of any service for convenience under the Second A&R MSA), these transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although EVERTEC has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the Current MSA (or, following the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, the Second A&R MSA), we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner. Furthermore, we may require transition assistance from EVERTEC beyond the term of the Current MSA (or, following the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, the Second A&R MSA), delaying and lengthening any transition process away from EVERTEC while increasing related costs.36  Under the Current MSA, we are required to provide written notice of non-renewal no less than one year prior to the relevant termination date avoid an automatic three-year renewal. Following the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, the automatic renewal of the Current MSA would be eliminated and we will be able to terminate services under the Second A&R MSA for convenience with 180 day prior notice. We would expect to exercise during the term of the Second A&R MSA the right to terminate certain services for convenience and to transition such services to other service providers prior to the expiration of the Second A&R MSA, subject to complying with the revenue minimums contemplated in the Second A&R MSA and certain other conditions. In practice, in order to switch to a new provider for a particular service, we will have to commence procuring and working on a transition process for such service significantly in advance of its termination and, in any case, much earlier than the automatic renewal notice date or the expiration date of the Second A&R MSA, and such process may extend beyond the current term of the Current MSA (or, following the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, the Second A&R MSA). Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the revenues we derive from EVERTEC, could be materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with EVERTEC or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term. The EVERTEC Transaction could also result in a material reduction in the value of our ownership interest in EVERTEC, will eliminate our rights to nominate directors to EVERTEC’s board of directors and is expected to result in the elimination of the income we report from this investment.We continue to have a 16.19% ownership interest in EVERTEC (though this interest would be reduced to approximately 10.5% upon the EVERTEC Transaction Closing) and account for this investment under the equity method. As a result, we include our investment in EVERTEC in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. For 2021, our share of EVERTEC’s changes in equity recognized in income was $26 million. The carrying value of our investment in EVERTEC was, as of December 31, 2021, approximately $110 million. Meanwhile, the services EVERTEC delivers to us represent a significant portion of EVERTEC’s revenues (approximately 41% for 2021). As a result, if we were not to renew the MSA and our other current agreements with EVERTEC, or otherwise terminate them before the end of their terms, EVERTEC’s financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the income we report from this investment, may be materially reduced. Furthermore, revenue from EVERTEC’s merchant acquiring business, which constitutes approximately 24% of EVERTEC’s revenues, depends, in part, on EVERTEC’s alliance with BPPR. If such relationship were to suffer, or be terminated, EVERTEC’s business may be adversely affected.  Future sales of our EVERTEC common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could also adversely affect the market price of EVERTEC common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings. In particular, in connection with the EVERTEC Transaction, we have agreed to enter into a Registration Rights and Sell-Down Agreement at the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, pursuant to which we will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell to third parties a sufficient number of our shares of EVERTEC common stock so as to reduce our ownership of shares of EVERTEC common stock to no more than 4.99% of the total number of shares of EVERTEC common stock outstanding within ninety days of the EVERTEC Transaction Closing. In addition, the Registration Rights and Sell-Down Agreement provides that any shares of EVERTEC common stock we own in excess of 4.5% at the end of such ninety day period will be converted into shares of EVERTEC non-voting preferred stock that convert back into common stock when transferred in a widespread public distribution or in certain other qualifying transfers. The market price of EVERTEC common stock—and thus, the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings—could be negatively affected by the announcement of the EVERTEC Transaction, the fact that we would be disposing of shares of EVERTEC common stock representing at least approximately 5.7% of the total outstanding shares of EVERTEC common stock at the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, as well as by the perception that further sales by us could occur as contemplated by the Registration Rights and Sell-Down Agreement, among other factors. Furthermore, the termination of the existing Stockholder Agreement between Popular and EVERTEC, which will result in the elimination of Popular’s rights to nominate two directors to EVERTEC’s board of directors, among other rights, and Popular’s commitment under the Registration Rights and Sell-Down Agreement to reduce, within ninety days of the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, its ownership of shares of EVERTEC common stock to no more than 4.99% of the total number of shares of EVERTEC common stock outstanding, is expected to eliminate Popular’s earnings from its equity investment in Evertec and subject the valuation of any remaining stake in Evertec to mark-to-market accounting and consequent exposure to market risk.37  The proposed EVERTEC Transaction is subject to closing conditions.The EVERTEC Transaction Closing is subject to various conditions including, among others, (i) regulatory approvals, (ii) the absence of certain legal proceedings, (iii) completion of a network segmentation project with respect to the Acquired Assets and certain other migration and technology projects relating to BPPR’s post-closing operation of the Acquired Assets, (iv) the occurrence of specified events that would materially and adversely affect the ability of the parties to comply with certain of their obligations under existing commercial agreements, and (v) certain other customary conditions. Additionally, the Evertec Transaction Closing is subject to Popular receiving a non-control determination from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with respect to EVERTEC, which is expected to be conditioned upon, among other things, Popular terminating the existing Stockholder Agreement between Popular and EVERTEC and Popular reducing, within ninety days of the EVERTEC Transaction Closing, its ownership of shares of EVERTEC common stock to no more than 4.99% of the total number of shares of EVERTEC common stock outstanding. We may not receive the required non-control determination, or other conditions to closing may not be met, or they may not be met in a timely manner, which may affect our ability to complete the transaction in a timely manner, or at all, or the regulatory clearances may be received subject to terms, conditions or restrictions that may cause a failure of the closing conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, could have a material detrimental impact on the Acquired Assets and/or could significantly diminish the benefits of the EVERTEC Transaction. We are subject to additional risks relating to the pending EVERTEC Transaction.There are numerous additional risks and uncertainties associated with the EVERTEC Transaction, including: we may incur significant transaction costs in connection with the EVERTEC Transaction, which costs may exceed those currently anticipated; unforeseen events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may delay or prevent the completion of the EVERTEC Transaction or materially diminish the expected benefits of the EVERTEC Transaction; the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement may terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement under certain circumstances; we will be required to devote significant attention and resources to the integration of the Acquired Assets, both in the form of preparatory efforts that occur prior to the EVERTEC Transaction Closing as well as post-closing implementation and integration efforts, and such efforts will involve a significant degree of technological complexity and reliance on EVERTEC and other third parties, including with respect to the receipt of any necessary consents to transfer third-party vendor licenses (or obtain new such licenses) and the post-closing set-up of developer tools required to manage the Acquired Assets; we may be unable to retain the employees and third-party contractors expected to be hired or engaged by us in connection with the EVERTEC Transaction and who are necessary to operate and integrate the Acquired Assets; we may be subject to incremental operational and security risks arising from the transfer of the Acquired Assets to BPPR, including those risks arising from, among other things, the activities required to execute network segmentation, the possibility of misconfiguration of access or security services during the transition period and during the implementation of new processes or security controls, the possibility of mismanagement of security services during the transition phase, and the need to develop a robust internal control framework; the anticipated benefits of the EVERTEC Transaction could be limited if EVERTEC fails to deliver to BPPR, in a timely manner or in a manner that meets BPPR’s requirements, the core application programming interfaces (APIs) that EVERTEC has committed to develop (subject to the scope and timeline provided by an independent third-party) in order for BPPR to connect the Acquired Assets (and any future enhancements or substitute channel applications thereto) to existing EVERTEC Group core applications, which is expected to enable BPPR’s ability to enhance and innovate in such channels in the future;  we may be exposed to heightened business risks as a result of the extension until 2035 of BPPR’s exclusivity with EVERTEC in connection with its merchant acquiring business, as well as the extension until 2030 of BPPR’s commitment with respect to the ATH Network, in light of the pace of technology changes and competition in the payments industry; resources from Popular and EVERTEC may be diverted from other critical Popular projects to complete the EVERTEC Transaction, while EVERTEC’s strategy and investments after the EVERTEC Transaction Closing may be refocused away from Popular towards other strategic initiatives; we may be unable to successfully execute the EVERTEC Transaction and, as a result, may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the EVERTEC Transaction in the intended timeframe, or at all; and we may not be able to execute the contemplated sell down of EVERTEC shares or otherwise receive any required regulatory approvals to effect a return to shareholders, via common stock repurchases, of any after-tax gains resulting from such sale. Any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, financial condition, and/or stock price.38  RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES Dividends on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or Preferred Stock without selling their shares.Holders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. During 2009, we suspended dividend payments on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. We resumed payment of dividends on our Preferred Stock in December 2010 and on our Common Stock in October 2015. There can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock or Common Stock in any future periods. This could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Also, we are a bank holding company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies should pay dividends on common stock only out of the net income available to common stock over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.  In addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by trusts that have issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our Common Stock and Preferred Stock, or from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. Accordingly, stockholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Stockholders may not realize a gain on their investment when they sell the Common Stock or Preferred Stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment. Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control.Until our existing classified Board of Directors structure is fully phased out beginning with our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes. At the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors was elected for a term expiring at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a term expiring at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter directors will be elected annually. Therefore, until our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock. For further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the MD&A section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. "
13,BPOP,POPULAR INC,2021-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We, like other financial institutions, face risks inherent to our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.The risks described in this report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or that are generally applicable to all financial institutions, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital position. RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS and economic ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly disrupted the global economy and the markets in which we operate, which has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operation. Its continued impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility in the financial markets, significantly increased unemployment levels worldwide and decreased consumer confidence and commercial activity generally, including in the markets in which we do business, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures. The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to higher and more volatile credit loss expense and potential for increased charge-offs; loan and credit ratings downgrades; credit deterioration and defaults in many industries; a significant increase in the volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity markets; and a decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities and other investment securities, which has led to decreased net interest income. In response to the pandemic, governments across the world, including the governments of Puerto Rico (our primary market), the United States Virgin Islands (“USVI”) and the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”), as well as state governments in the United States mainland, including New York, New Jersey and Florida, where Popular Bank (“PB”) has branches, ordered the temporary closure of many businesses, implemented mandatory curfews and the institution of social distancing, shelter in place and other health and safety requirements. Although many of these restrictive measures have been eased or lifted, allowing for the gradual reopening of the economy, certain restrictive measures remain in place and additional restrictive measures may be implemented in the future as a result of a resurgence in the spread of the virus or new strains of the virus. The restrictions imposed by governments in response to the outbreak caused significant disruption to economic activity and an increase in unemployment in the markets in which we operate, including Puerto Rico, which has been facing significant fiscal and economic challenges for over a decade. For more information, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further deterioration of the Puerto Rico, USVI, BVI and the broader U.S. economy would be expected to adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to comply with their financial obligations and adversely impact demand for our products and services. The disruption in economic activity could also adversely affect the financial condition of government entities in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI to which we have exposure. The COVID-19 pandemic also has significantly disrupted our operations and negatively impacted our business and financial condition. Many of BPPR’s and PB’s branches were temporarily closed in response to the pandemic. Currently, nearly all BPPR’s and PB’s branches are operating, in all instances subject to measures to preserve the health and safety of our employees and customers. To protect the health and safety of our workforce, we have facilitated a significant portion of our workforce to work remotely, which further exposes the Corporation to heightened risks with respect to cybersecurity, information security and other operational incidents, as well as our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls. Furthermore, although we have21 implemented a remote work protocol for many of our workers and instituted health and safety measures to protect employees that cannot work remotely, a disruption to our ability to deliver financial products or services to, or interact with, our customers could also result in losses or increased operational costs, regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions, or harm our reputation. Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, beginning in March 2020, the Corporation implemented measures to provide financial relief to customers through programs such as payment moratoriums, suspensions of foreclosures and other collection activity, as well as waivers of certain fees and service charges. By the end of the third quarter of 2020 the Corporation had reinstated the imposition of these fees and service charges and resumed its delinquent loan collection efforts. The Federal Government also approved several economic stimulus measures, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, that seek to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic, including guaranteeing loans to small and medium-sized businesses through the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). However, there can be no assurance that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to offset the pandemic’s economic impact. In addition, moratoriums imposed by Federal or state law or provided voluntarily by the Corporation may limit our ability to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition of certain of our customers and the credit quality of our loan portfolio until borrowers that have benefited from such moratoriums are required to resume loan repayments. As of December 31, 2020, only 4,359 loans with an aggregate book value of $0.5 billion remained subject to payment moratoriums. For a discussion on the loan payment moratorium programs implemented by the Corporation to provide financial relief to customers during the pandemic, refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses section of the MD&A in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such moratorium and stimulus programs have also imposed significant operational burdens on the Corporation, which also heighten the risk of operational incidents, including fraud and undetected errors. Our participation (or lack of participation) in certain governmental programs enacted in response to the pandemic, including the PPP, could further result in reputational harm, litigation and regulatory and other government action against the Corporation. For example, the Corporation may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Corporation regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications under the PPP and may be exposed to adverse action for the improper conduct of its employees in connection with such loans. Furthermore, the Corporation may also have credit risk with respect to PPP loans if the SBA determines that there have been deficiencies in the way a PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Corporation, and denies its liability under the guaranty, reduces the amount of the guaranty or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seeks recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Corporation.The Corporation’s financial results for the year 2020 reflect the impact of the business disruption and relief measures described above. For example, the Corporation’s revenue streams were impacted during the first and second quarters of the year as a result of reduced consumer transaction activity, lower interchange income, the waiver of certain late fees and service charges, as well as the suspension in mortgage origination and related securitization and loan sale activities. During 2020, the Corporation also incurred additional expenses related to front-line employee bonuses, the enabling of remote access for employees to work from home, the expansion of employee benefits, as well as the impact of specific measures to prevent the spread of the disease and efforts related to customer relief programs, among other related expenses. The Corporation’s financial results for the second half of 2020 reflect the impact of increased economic activity because of the gradual reopening of the economy and the related improvement in the macroeconomic environment, as well as the impact of the various government stimulus programs launched in response to the pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition (including our provision for credit losses, net charge offs, regulatory capital, liquidity ratios and the liquidity of the bank holding company and its operating subsidiaries), as well as the operations of our clients, customers, service providers and suppliers, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict at this time, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the appearance of new strains of the virus and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, such as the speed and effectiveness of vaccination programs and the nature and length of economic stimulus initiatives. To the extent the pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section. A significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where economic and fiscal challenges have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us. Our credit exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which accounted as of December 31, 2020 for approximately 82% of our total assets, 84% of our deposits and 81% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets and asset values in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico entered recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (GNP) thereafter contracted in real terms every year between fiscal years 200722 and 2018 (inclusive), except fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the “Planning Board”) estimates, published in June 2020, the Commonwealth’s real GNP for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 decreased by 3.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The Planning Board estimates that real GNP increased approximately 1.5% in fiscal year 2019 due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and María, and that it decreased by approximately -5.4% in fiscal year 2020 due primarily to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same. The Planning Board projected that the negative effects of COVID-19 would continue through fiscal year 2021, resulting in a contraction in real GNP of approximately -2% in the current fiscal year.  The Commonwealth’s government has also been facing significant fiscal challenges that may have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The historical structural imbalance between revenues and expenditures, on the one hand, and unfunded legacy pension obligations, on the other hand, coupled with the Commonwealth’s inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on and eventually seeking to restructure their debts and for the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) in June 2016. PROMESA, among other things, established a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the “Oversight Board”) with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provided to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For a discussion of risks related to the Corporation’s credit exposure to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, see the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&A section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The credit quality of BPPR’s loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The Commonwealth’s prolonged recession resulted in limited loan demand and in an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. The measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the future could affect many of our individual customers and customers’ businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us. Fiscal adjustments have resulted and may continue to result in significant resistance from local politicians and other stakeholders, which may lead to social and political instability. Any reduction in consumer spending because of these issues may also adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues. If global or local economic conditions worsen, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis, including completing an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, those adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are outside of our control. Under such circumstances, we could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.Further deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations.The value of properties in some of the markets we serve, in particular in Puerto Rico, declined during the past decade as a result of adverse economic conditions. Further deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 27%, 27% and 3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans secured by real estate, mortgage loans and construction loans, respectively. Substantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is in Puerto Rico, the USVI, the BVI or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. General economic conditions in Puerto Rico (as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic) and fiscal reforms aimed at addressing the current fiscal crisis could cause a further deterioration of the value of the real estate collateral securing our loan portfolios.A further deterioration of the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would require increases in our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk section of the MD&A included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.23  Legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.Popular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal, New York and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal, New York or Puerto Rico laws or regulations (or laws and regulations in other jurisdictions in which we may do business, such as California), including any changes implemented by the new administration, could have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on Popular. Furthermore, the Commonwealth has enacted various reforms in response to its fiscal and economic problems and is likely to implement additional reforms as part of its obligations under PROMESA. RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESSThe fiscal and economic challenges of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our portfolio of government securities and our loans to government entities in such jurisdictions, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action in such jurisdictions. A reduction in Puerto Rico government deposits could also adversely affect our net interest income.We have direct and indirect lending and investment exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its public corporations and municipalities. A deterioration of the Commonwealth’s fiscal and economic condition, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or actions taken by the Commonwealth government or the Oversight Board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic crisis in Puerto Rico, could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our Puerto Rico government obligations, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action, resulting in losses to us. At December 31, 2020, our direct exposure to Puerto Rico government obligations was limited to obligations from various municipalities and amounted to $377 million. Of the amount outstanding at December 31, 2020, $342 million consisted of loans and $35 million consisted of securities. These municipal obligations are mostly general obligations backed by property tax revenues and to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or “special obligations”, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. In addition, at December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $317 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental. For additional discussion of the Corporation’s exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&A section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. BPPR’s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the Puerto Rico government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis and the ongoing debt restructuring proceedings under PROMESA. Similarly, BPPR’s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs. Furthermore, BPPR has a significant amount of deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships. A portion of such deposits could also be used by the Commonwealth as part of its debts restructuring agreements under Title III of PROMESA. While a significant decrease in these deposits should not materially affect our liquidity since such deposits are collateralized, a significant decrease in the amount of such deposits could adversely affect our net interest income. BPPR also has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure to USVI government entities. At December 31, 2020, BPPR’s direct exposure to USVI instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately $105 million, of which $70 million is outstanding. The USVI has been experiencing several fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. For additional information on the24 Corporation’s exposure to the USVI government, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&A section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time receive requests for information from departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments, including those that investigate mortgage-related conduct.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time self-report compliance matters to, or receive requests for information from, departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments. BPPR has received subpoenas and other requests for information from the departments of the U.S. government that investigate mortgage-related conduct, mainly concerning real estate appraisals and residential and construction loans in Puerto Rico. BPPR has also self-identified and reported to applicable regulators matters with respect to mortgage related practices. For example, in July 2017, management learned that certain letters related to approximately 23,000 residential mortgage loans generated by Popular to comply with Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“CFPB”) rules requiring written notification to borrowers who have submitted a loss mitigation application were not mailed to borrowers over a period of up to approximately three-years due to a systems interface error. Loss mitigation is a process whereby creditors work with mortgage loan borrowers who are having difficulties making their loan payments on their debt. Popular corrected the systems interface error that caused the letters not to be sent, notified applicable regulators (including the CFPB), completed a review of its mortgage files to assess the scope of potential customer impact and conducted outreach and remediation efforts with respect to borrowers potentially affected by the systems interface error.  Incidents of this nature and investigations or examinations by governmental authorities (whether arising from these incidents or otherwise) may result in judgments, settlements, fines, enforcement actions, penalties or other sanctions adverse to the Corporation which could materially and adversely affect the Corporation’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements.Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. We have furthermore retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December 31, 2020, we serviced $0.9 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2020, we repurchased approximately $161 million in mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2020, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $22 million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property. Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.In connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and they relate to, among other things, compliance with laws and regulations, underwriting standards, the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan. A loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan, and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. 25 Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market’s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting from representations and warranty violations on specific portfolios. At December 31, 2020, our reserve for estimated losses from representation and warranty arrangements amounted to $2 million, which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition. Nonetheless, we do not expect any such losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity.We are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include declaring dividends to our shareholders of our common stock, capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. Based on its current financial condition, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operation and capital position and may affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock. Additionally, continued adverse macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in further restrictions from regulators on dividends and repurchases of our common stock, which could limit the capital we return to our shareholders. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC’s DIF and, as a result, BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, our level of non-performing assets increases, or our risk profile changes or our capital position is impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums. Any future increases or special assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations. See the “Supervision and Regulation—FDIC Insurance” discussion in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information related to the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessments applicable to BPPR and PB.  Our business is susceptible to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. Reforms to and uncertainty regarding the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates. Since a high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes in rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates can have a material impact on our results of operations and the values of our assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Interest rates are also highly sensitive to many factors over which we have no control and which we may not be able to anticipate adequately, including general economic conditions and the monetary and tax policies of various governmental bodies, particularly the Federal Reserve. For a discussion of the Corporation’s interest rate sensitivity, please refer to the “Risk Management” section of the MD&A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the LIBOR administration announced that it would consider continuing publication of certain US dollar LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023, subject to applicable regulations. In response to this announcement, Federal regulators issued a statement that, among other things, encouraged all financial institutions to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years. As a result of this transition, interest rates on floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments held by the Corporation and tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected.26 Any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could also result in disruption in the financial markets. Further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates. Regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is difficult to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. Furthermore, the contractual documents governing the Corporation’s LIBOR-linked financial instruments may not provide effective fallback language in the event LIBOR rates cease to be published, which may present the Corporation with legal and regulatory risk if, for example, the Corporation is unable to amend these financial instruments prior to such cessation.If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations.As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $671 million, $851 million and $16 million, respectively, of goodwill, net deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.  Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in Popular’s stock price related to macroeconomic conditions in the global market as well as the weakness in the Puerto Rico economy and fiscal situation, declines in our market capitalization, reduced future earnings estimates, continuance of a low interest rate environment and the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may exacerbate these and other circumstances, could in turn result in an impairment of goodwill. The goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. The determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The analysis considers all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax-planning strategies. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the expected profitability of our businesses may affect the realizability of our deferred tax assets in our Puerto Rico and U.S. operations.  If we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of the goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by applicable regulators.Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the other federal banking agencies and the SEC, to adopt rules prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including Popular, PNA, BPPR and PB). The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which27 have not been finalized. Compliance with such revised rules may substantially affect the way in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. For a more detailed discussion of these proposed rules, see the “Supervision and Regulation—Incentive Compensation” section in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of Popular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate key employees. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long-term strategy. We are subject to risk related to our own credit rating; actions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the cost of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements in the future and may have other adverse effects on our business. Actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher credit quality. Our credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and our senior unsecured ratings are now “non-investment grade” with the three major rating agencies. The market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities. In addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect our relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based on our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. Our banking subsidiaries have servicing, licensing and custodial agreements with third parties that include ratings covenants. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require us to engage a substitute fund custodian and increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $50 million at December 31, 2020. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment grade. We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If a financial holding company fails to maintain well-capitalized status under the regulatory framework, or is deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if it experiences certain regulatory violations, its status as a financial holding company and its related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and its ability to offer certain financial products, may be compromised and its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published Basel IV in December 2017. Basel IV significantly revises the Basel capital framework, and the impact on us will depend on the way the revisions are implemented in the U.S. See the28 “Supervision and Regulation – Capital Adequacy” discussion in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information related to the Basel III Capital Rules and Basel IV. The resolution of pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, if unfavorable, could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to our legal risk, see Note 23 - “Commitments & Contingencies”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks. If we, and our subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers, are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and penalties, and other regulatory actions, as well as governmental investigations.As a federally regulated financial institution, we must comply with regulations and economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Treasury, as well as anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including those under the Bank Secrecy Act.  Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. We are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act, including the requirement to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports, that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities. In addition, as a financial institution we are required to, among other things, identify our customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions. Failure by the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Corporation, including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action, including significant civil and criminal penalties. We can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements. The markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks.We have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations. With respect to OFAC regulations and economic and trade sanction programs, these policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctioned-country and person’s involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying and where applicable, blocking and rejecting transactions of our customers or our customers’ customers that may involve a sanctioned person, government or country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified, blocked or rejected by our policies, controls and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC. There can be no assurances that any failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes, or with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, will not result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. Furthermore, if the policies, controls, and procedures of one of the Corporation’s third-party service providers do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us, and, in the case of EVERTEC, could adversely affect the value of our investment in EVERTEC. 29 RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONSWe are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks, that if realized, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These cybersecurity risks have been heightened by the increase on our employees’ remote work capabilities and in the use of digital channels by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to transmit and store sensitive data. We employ a layered defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity and identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times, especially as the threats from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe. The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future as we continue to expand our mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and Popular’s internal use of internet-based products and applications. We continue to detect and identify attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, as well as attackers that respond rapidly to changes in defensive countermeasures. We have been the target of phishing attacks in the past, targeting both our customers and employees through brand and email impersonation, that have compromised the email accounts of certain of our customers and employees. We continually monitor and address those vulnerabilities and continue to enhance our security measures to detect and prevent such events, while enhancing employee and customer trainings and awareness campaigns. There can be no assurances, however, that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future. Furthermore, increased use of remote access and third-party video conferencing solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to facilitate work-from-home arrangements for employees, and facilitating the use of digital channels by our customers, could increase our exposure to cyber attacks. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by Popular’s employees.  The most significant cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and computer intrusion that might result in disruption of services and in the exposure or loss of customer or proprietary data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems and extract funds from customer’s credit cards or bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the compromise of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of digital channels for banking, such as mobile banking and other technology-based products and services used by us and our customers. Although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties, we have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of any cyber-attacks. A successful compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could have serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems used by us or by our clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, if personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled, misused or stolen, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have30 released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see “Regulation and Supervision” in Part I, Item 1 — Business, included in this Form 10-K. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. We rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information security, technology and business process services. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed below under “Risks Relating to Our Relationship with EVERTEC.” The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties’ suppliers or vendors (so-called “fourth party risk”). We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including risks associated with supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. If Popular’s operational systems, or those of external parties on which Popular’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of our businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, Popular could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed below under “Risks Relating to Our Relationship with EVERTEC.” While we select third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions and we may also be subject to long-term contracts with certain of these vendors (including EVERTEC) that, for example, limit our ability to replace these vendors. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by a vendor, breaches of a vendor’s systems, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor’s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors, when possible, could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. In addition, the assessment and management by financial institutions of the risks associated with third party vendors have been subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with our oversight of third-party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities. Our failure to properly manage risks associated to our third-party relationships could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by our regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. Unforeseen or catastrophic events, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters or the emergence of pandemics or epidemics, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Climate change could also have a material adverse impact on our business operations and that of our clients and customers.The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events in the markets in which we do business, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, or the emergence of pandemics could cause a disruption in our operations31 and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our operations are located in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI, a region susceptible to hurricanes, earthquakes and other similar events. For example, in 2017, our operations in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI were significantly disrupted by the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In January 2020, Puerto Rico was impacted by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake which caused island-wide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island. Future natural disasters can again cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We maintain insurance against natural disasters including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic natural disaster could produce to the markets that we serve and the potential negative impact to economic activity. Further, future natural disasters in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may further adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. Man-made disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other events connected with the regions in which we operate could have similar effects. The frequency, severity and impact of future hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics, epidemics and other similar events are difficult to predict. Furthermore, we operate in regions, countries and communities where our business and the activities and operations of our clients and customers may be further disrupted by global climate change. Potential physical risks from climate change include the increase in the frequency and severity of weather events, such as storms and hurricanes, and long-term shifts in climate patters, such as sustained higher and lower temperatures, sea level rise, heat waves and droughts, among others. These events may cause disruptions in our business and operations and the destruction of our properties and assets. Furthermore, these severe weather events may also disrupt the businesses and operations of our clients and customers and damage the properties and assets of our borrowers, adversely affecting the financial condition of our clients and customers and the value of any collateral held by us. Losses resulting from these disasters and severe weather events may make it more difficult for our borrowers to timely repay their loans. If these events occur, we may experience a decrease in the value of our loan portfolio and our revenue, and may incur in additional operational expenses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the impact of climate change in the markets that we operate and in other global markets may have the effect of increasing the costs or reducing the availability of insurance needed for our business operations. Climate change may also create transitional risks resulting from a shift to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks, which we may be subject to, may include changes in the legal and regulatory landscape, technology, consumer sentiment and preferences, and market demands that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change. These climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on asset values and on our business and financial performance and those of our clients and customers. risks related to acquisition transactions Potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face, and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints.To the extent permitted by our applicable regulators, we may pursue strategic acquisition opportunities. Acquiring other banks or businesses, however, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, potential disruption to our business, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company. If in connection with an acquisition we pay a premium over book or market value, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, acquiring loan portfolios involves various risks. When acquiring loan portfolios, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In estimating the extent of the losses, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, however, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolios, which would negatively affect our operating results. 32 Finally, certain acquisitions by financial institutions, including us, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. RISKS RELATING TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERTECWe are dependent on EVERTEC for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.In connection with the sale of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a long-term Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) with EVERTEC, pursuant to which we agreed to receive from EVERTEC, on an exclusive basis, certain core banking and financial transaction processing and information technology and security services. The term of the MSA extends until September 30, 2025. Under the MSA, we also granted EVERTEC a right of first refusal over certain services or products and development projects related to the services thereunder provided. We also entered into several other agreements, generally coterminous with the MSA, pursuant to which BPPR agreed to sponsor EVERTEC as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations, agreed to certain exclusivity and non-solicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services, and agreed to support the ATH brand and network, among other matters. As a result, we are now dependent on EVERTEC for the provision of essential services to our business, including our core banking business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that EVERTEC will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing, security and technology services. As a result, our relationship with EVERTEC exposes us to operational, cybersecurity and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of our agreements with EVERTEC, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of EVERTEC, including those relating to a breakdown or failure of EVERTEC’s systems or internal controls environment, including as a result of security breaches or attacks, employee error or malfeasance, system breakdowns, vulnerabilities, obsolescence or otherwise. Over the term of the MSA, we have experienced various interruptions and delays in key services provided by EVERTEC, as well as cyber breaches, system breakdowns and instances of application obsolescence. The continuance or increase in service delays or interruptions, vulnerabilities in EVERTEC’s information systems, or cyberattacks to, or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, expose us to regulatory, legal and compliance risk and damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding our cybersecurity risks, refer to the “We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business” risk factor. Our ability to recover from EVERTEC for breach of the MSA, including the failure to meet the service levels provided for therein, may not fully compensate us for the damages we may suffer as a result of such breach.Popular faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. If EVERTEC is unable to meet constant technological changes and react quickly to meet new industry standards, we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.We operate in a highly competitive environment in which we must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of technological advances. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. We compete on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, innovation, price, ease of use, reputation and transaction execution. To compete effectively, we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products and services to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors, including technology companies and other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. These enhancements and new products and services require the delivery of technology services by EVERTEC pursuant to the MSA, making our success dependent on EVERTEC’s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner.  Some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than EVERTEC and that may have better technological capabilities and product offerings. Furthermore, financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers’ compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, and in most cases such costs are borne by the33 technology provider. Because of our contractual relationship with EVERTEC, however, we may be required to bear the full cost of such developments and modifications pursuant to the MSA.  Moreover, the terms, speed, scalability and functionality of certain of EVERTEC’s technology services are not competitive when compared to offerings from its competitors. Evertec’s failure to sufficiently invest in and upscale its technology and services infrastructure to meet the rapidly changing technology demands of our industry may result in us being unable to meet customer expectations and attract or retain customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce Popular’s revenues, place us in a competitive disadvantage and significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  A transition to a new financial services technology provider, and the replacement of services currently provided to us by EVERTEC, may be lengthy and complex.Switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology and security services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks, even where such a switch can be accomplished without violating our contractual obligations to EVERTEC. The implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs) and business disruption. Upon the transition of all or a portion of existing services provided by EVERTEC to a new financial services technology provider, either at the end of the term of the MSA and related agreements or earlier upon the occurrence of an early termination thereunder, these transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although EVERTEC has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the MSA, we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner. Furthermore, we may require transition assistance from EVERTEC beyond the term of the MSA, delaying and lengthening any transition process away from EVERTEC while increasing related costs.Under the MSA, we are required to provide written notice of non-renewal no less than one year prior to the relevant termination date avoid an automatic three-year renewal. In practice, however, if we decided to switch to a new provider, we would have to commence procuring and working on a transition process much earlier and such process may extend beyond the current term of the MSA. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the revenues we derive from EVERTEC, could be materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with EVERTEC or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term.We continue to have a 16.16% ownership interest in EVERTEC and account for this investment under the equity method. As such, we include our investment in EVERTEC in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. For 2020, our share of EVERTEC’s changes in equity recognized in income was $17.8 million. The carrying value of our investment in EVERTEC was, as of December 31, 2020, approximately $86 million. Meanwhile, the services EVERTEC delivers to us represent a significant portion of EVERTEC’s revenues (approximately 47% for 2020). As a result, if we were not to renew the MSA and our other agreements with EVERTEC, or otherwise terminate them before the end of their term, EVERTEC’s financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the income we report from this investment, may be materially reduced. Furthermore, revenue from EVERTEC’s merchant acquiring business, which constitutes approximately 22% of EVERTEC’s revenues, depends, in part, on EVERTEC’s alliance with BPPR. If such relationship were to suffer, or be terminated, EVERTEC’s business may be adversely affected. Furthermore, future sales of our EVERTEC common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of EVERTEC common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings. RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES Dividends on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or Preferred Stock without selling their shares.Holders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. During 2009, we suspended dividend payments on our 34 Common Stock and Preferred Stock. We resumed payment of dividends on our Preferred Stock in December 2010 and on our Common Stock in October 2015. There can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock or Common Stock in any future periods. This could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Also, we are a bank holding company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies should pay dividends on common stock only out of the net income available to common stock over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.  In addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by each trust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our Common Stock and Preferred Stock, or from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. Accordingly, stockholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Stockholders may not realize a gain on their investment when they sell the Common Stock or Preferred Stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment. Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control.Until our existing classified Board of Directors structure is fully phased out beginning with our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes. At the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a term expiring at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a term expiring at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter directors will be elected annually. Therefore, until our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock. For further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the MD&A section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. "
4,BPOP,POPULAR INC,2020-03-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We, like other financial institutions, face a number of risks inherent to our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.The risks described in this report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or that are generally applicable to all financial institutions, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital position.18  RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS and economic ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY A significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where economic and fiscal challenges have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us. Our credit exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which accounted as of December 31, 2019 for approximately 82% of our revenues, 78% of our total assets and 79% of our deposits. As such, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets and asset values in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico entered recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (GNP) thereafter contracted in real terms every year between fiscal years 2007 and 2018 (inclusive), except fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the “Planning Board”) estimates, published in July 2019, the Commonwealth’s real GNP for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 decreased by 3% and 4.7%, respectively. The Planning Board’s report projected an increase in real GNP of approximately 2% and 3.6% in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, in part due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments that followed Hurricanes Irma and María. The Commonwealth’s ability to achieve such projections, however, will depend to a large extent on the amount federal disaster relief funding actually received and the timing of the approval and disbursement of such funds.The Commonwealth’s government has also been facing significant fiscal challenges. The structural imbalance between revenues and expenditures, on the one hand, and unfunded legacy pension obligations, on the other hand, coupled with the Commonwealth’s inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on and eventually seeking to restructure their debts.The Commonwealth’s fiscal and economic crisis prompted the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) in June 2016. PROMESA, among other things, established a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the “Oversight Board”) with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provided to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In August 2016, President Obama appointed the seven voting members of the Oversight Board through the process established in PROMESA, which authorized the President to select the members from several lists required to be submitted by congressional leaders. The constitutionality of such appointments, however, is currently being challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court. Any outcome that results in the voidance of the Oversight Board’s past actions could create further fiscal instability and adversely affect the Puerto Rico economy. The credit quality of BPPR’s loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The prolonged recession resulted in limited loan demand and in an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. The measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the future could affect many of our individual customers and customers’ businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us. Fiscal adjustments have resulted and may continue to result in significant resistance from local politicians and other stakeholders, which may lead to social and political instability. Any reduction in consumer spending because of these issues may also adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues. If global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis, including completing an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, those adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are outside of our control. Under such circumstances, we could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.Our assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 40 to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K. Further deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations.19 The value of properties in some of the markets we serve, in particular in Puerto Rico, declined during the past decade as a result of adverse economic conditions. Further deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 28%, 26% and 3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans secured by real estate, mortgage loans and construction loans, respectively.Substantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”), the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. General economic conditions in Puerto Rico and fiscal reforms aimed at addressing the current fiscal crisis could cause a further deterioration of the value of the real estate collateral securing our loan portfolios.We measure loan impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values, principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observed transactions involving similar assets in similar locations, size and supply and demand. An appraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed.A further deterioration of the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would require increases in our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk section of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Annual Report. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by difficult conditions in the U.S. and global financial industries. During the financial crisis that commenced in 2008, market instability and lack of investor confidence led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. This led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity in general. The resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial markets adversely affected our industry and our business, results of operations and financial condition. A re-occurrence of these or other difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us and others in the financial industry. Legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.Popular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal, New York and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal, New York or Puerto Rico laws or regulations could have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on Popular. Furthermore, the Commonwealth has enacted various reforms in response to its fiscal and economic problems and is likely to implement additional reforms as part of its obligations under PROMESA. RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESSWe are subject to default risk in our loan portfolio.We are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate or acquire. We establish provisions for loan losses, which lead to reductions in our income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic and market20 conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in the future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond our control. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses in excess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and may be required to increase such amounts. The fiscal and economic challenges of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our portfolio of government securities and our loans to government entities in such jurisdictions, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action in such jurisdictions. A reduction in Puerto Rico government deposits could also adversely affect our net interest income.We have direct and indirect lending and investment exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its public corporations and municipalities. A deterioration of the Commonwealth’s fiscal and economic condition, including as a result of actions taken by the Commonwealth government or the Oversight Board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic crisis in Puerto Rico, could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our Puerto Rico government obligations, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action, resulting in losses to us. At December 31, 2019, our direct exposure to Puerto Rico government obligations was limited to obligations from various municipalities and amounted to $432 million. Of the amount outstanding at December 31, 2019, $391 million consisted of loans and $41 million consisted of securities. These municipal obligations are mostly general obligations backed by property tax revenues and to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or “special obligations”, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. At December 31, 2019, 75% of our exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of San Juan, Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayamón. In May 2019, the Oversight Board designated all 78 municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA. For a discussion of the implications of being designated a covered entity under PROMESA, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Annual Report. The Commonwealth’s certified fiscal plan does not contemplate a restructuring of the debts of Puerto Rico’s municipalities. The plan, however, provides for the gradual phase out of Commonwealth appropriations to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities. Since fiscal year 2017, Commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have been reduced by approximately 64% (from approximately $370 million in fiscal year 2017 to approximately $132 million in fiscal year 2020). The 2019 Commonwealth Fiscal Plan provides for additional reductions in appropriations to municipalities every fiscal year, holding appropriations constant at $112 million starting in fiscal year 2022, before ultimately phasing out all appropriations in fiscal year 2024. Although the certified fiscal plan contemplates that the reduction in subsidies may be offset by other measures, the reduction in subsidies could have a material negative impact on the financial condition of various municipalities, particularly if such offsetting measures are not fully or timely implemented. Furthermore, municipalities may also be affected by the negative effects resulting from other expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Commonwealth’s fiscal and liquidity shortfalls.  In addition, at December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $350 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental. These included $276 million in residential mortgage loans insured by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (“HFA”), a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA. These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The Corporation also had at December 31, 2019, $46 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions. In the event that the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA’s ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA at the time such obligations become due and payable. Although the Governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, she has not exercised this power as of the date hereof. In21 addition, at December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $7 million in securities issued by HFA that have been economically defeased and refunded and for which securities consisting of U.S. agencies and Treasury obligations have been escrowed, and $21 million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities but that are payable from rent paid by non-governmental parties.  BPPR’s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the Puerto Rico government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis and the ongoing debt restructuring proceedings under PROMESA. Similarly, BPPR’s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs.  Furthermore, BPPR has a significant amount of deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships. A portion of such deposits could also be used by the Commonwealth as part of its restructuring agreements under Title III of PROMESA. While a significant decrease in these deposits should not materially affect our liquidity since such deposits are collateralized, a significant decrease in the amount of such deposits could adversely affect our net interest income. BPPR also has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure to USVI government entities. At December 31, 2019, BPPR’s direct exposure to USVI instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately $71 million, of which $67 million is outstanding. The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities. To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the Government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.  We have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. We request collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitor these on a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by us and result in losses.  Our ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when market confidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion among participants may increase substantially and make it more difficult for us to borrow in the credit or capital markets. Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time receive requests for information from departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments, including those that investigate mortgage-related conduct. Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time self-report compliance matters to, or receive requests for information from, departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments. In particular, BPPR has received subpoenas and other requests for information from the departments of the U.S. government that investigate mortgage-related conduct, mainly concerning real estate appraisals and residential and construction loans in Puerto Rico. BPPR has also self-identified and reported to applicable regulators matters with respect to mortgage related practices. For example, in July 2017, management learned that certain letters related to approximately 23,000 residential mortgage loans generated by Popular to comply with Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“CFPB”) rules requiring written notification to22 borrowers who have submitted a loss mitigation application were not mailed to borrowers over a period of up to approximately three-years due to a systems interface error. Loss mitigation is a process whereby creditors work with mortgage loan borrowers who are having difficulties making their loan payments on their debt. Popular corrected the systems interface error that caused the letters not to be sent, notified applicable regulators (including the CFPB), completed a review of its mortgage files to assess the scope of potential customer impact and conducted outreach and remediation efforts with respect to borrowers potentially affected by the systems interface error.  Incidents of this nature and/or investigations by governmental authorities (whether arising from these incidents or otherwise) may result in judgments, settlements, fines, enforcement actions, penalties or other sanctions adverse to the Corporation which could materially and adversely affect the Corporation’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements.  Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. We have furthermore retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December 31, 2019, we serviced $1.2 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2019, we repurchased approximately $57 million in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2019, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $35 million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property. Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition. In connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and they relate to, among other things: compliance with laws and regulations; underwriting standards; the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file; and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan.  A loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan, and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market’s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting from representations and warranty violations on specific portfolios. At December 31, 2019, our reserve for estimated losses from representation and warranty arrangements amounted to $3 million, which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition. Nonetheless, we do not expect any such losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. 23 Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.  Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC’s DIF, and as a result, BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, our level of non-performing assets increases, or our risk profile changes or our capital position is impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums. Any future increases or special assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations. See the “Supervision and Regulation—FDIC Insurance” discussion within Item 1. Business of the Annual Report for additional information related to the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessments applicable to BPPR and PB.  Our business is susceptible to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. Reforms to and uncertainty regarding the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates. Since a high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes in rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates can have a material impact on our results of operations and the values of our assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Interest rates are also highly sensitive to many factors over which we have no control and which we may not be able to anticipate adequately, including general economic conditions and the monetary and tax policies of various governmental bodies, particularly the Federal Reserve. For a discussion of the Corporation’s interest rate sensitivity, please refer to the “Risk Management” section of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years. As a result of this transition, interest rates on floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments held by the Corporation and tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. Any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could also result in disruption in the financial markets. Further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates.Regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations.As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $671 million, $885 million and $23 million, respectively, of goodwill, net deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.  Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in Popular’s stock price related to macroeconomic conditions in the global market as well as24 the weakness in the Puerto Rico economy and fiscal situation, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry. The goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. Declines in our market capitalization could also increase the risk of goodwill impairment in the future.  The determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The analysis considers all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax-planning strategies. If we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of the goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our results of operations would be adversely affected. We could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies.The preparation of the Corporation’s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as more detailed accounting policies established by the Corporation’s management. From time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change, and in some cases these changes could have a material effect on the Corporations’ financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results.  For example, beginning January 1, 2020, the Corporation and other U.S. companies were required to implement a new accounting standard, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) framework, which requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments, replacing the incurred loss model. The Corporation expects that under CECL, it will need to, among other things, increase the allowance for loan and lease losses, which may have a negative impact on the Corporation’s capital levels. This new accounting standard may present operational challenges and will require the Corporation to change how it makes assumptions and estimates on loan and lease losses as well as other financial assets. Also, this new accounting standard may result in greater volatility of the Corporation’s earnings and capital levels and could potentially affect the Corporation’s capital distribution plans, depending upon final guidance from regulators. For additional information on this and other accounting standards, see Note 3, “New Accounting Pronouncements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K. Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by applicable regulators.Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the other federal banking agencies and the SEC, to adopt rules prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including Popular, PNA, BPPR and PB). The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. Compliance with such revised rules may substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. For a more detailed discussion of these proposed rules, see the “Supervision and Regulation—Incentive Compensation” section within Item 1. Business of the Annual Report.25  The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of Popular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate key employees. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long-term strategy. As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity.We are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. In addition, based on its current financial condition, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market. We are subject to risk related to our own credit rating; actions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the cost of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements in the future and may have other adverse effects on our business. Actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher credit quality. Our credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and our senior unsecured ratings are now “non-investment grade” with the three major rating agencies. The market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities. Our banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. At December 31, 2019, the banking subsidiaries had $9 million in deposits that were subject to rating triggers. In addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect our relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based on our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. 26 Our banking subsidiaries have servicing, licensing and custodial agreements with third parties that include ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require us to engage a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $66 million at December 31, 2019. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment grade. We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If a financial holding company fails to maintain well-capitalized status under the regulatory framework, or is deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if it experiences certain regulatory violations, its status as a financial holding company and its related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and its ability to offer certain financial products, may be compromised and its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published Basel IV in December 2017. Basel IV significantly revises the Basel capital framework, and the impact on us will depend on the manner in which the revisions are implemented in the U.S. See the “Supervision and Regulation – Capital Adequacy” discussion within Item 1. Business of the Annual Report for additional information related to the Basel III Capital Rules and Basel IV. The resolution of pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, if unfavorable, could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to our legal risk, see Note 26 - “Commitments & Contingencies”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report in this Form 10-K. Complying with economic sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks. If we, and our subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and other penalties, as well as governmental investigations.As a regulated financial institution, we must comply with regulations and federal economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Treasury, as well as anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including those under the Bank Secrecy Act. Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. We are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act, including the requirement to file suspicious 27 activity and currency transaction reports, that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities. In addition, as a financial institution we are required to, among other things, identify our customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions. Failure by the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Corporation, including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action, including significant civil and criminal penalties. We can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements. The markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks.We have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations. With respect to OFAC regulations and economic sanction programs, these policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctioned-country and person’s involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying and where applicable, blocking and rejecting transactions of our customers or our customers’ customers that may involve a sanctioned person, government or country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities, and a violation of applicable U.S. laws and regulations could adversely affect the market for our securities.  From time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified and blocked by our policies and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC. There can be no assurances that any failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes, or with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, will not result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. Furthermore, if the policies and procedures of one of the Corporation’s third-party service providers do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us, and, in the case of EVERTEC, could adversely affect the value of our investment in EVERTEC.  RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONSWe are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ a defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective, especially as the threat from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe, attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. We have been the target of phishing scams in the past targeting our customers as a result of compromised email accounts of several Popular employees. We have addressed the vulnerabilities that permitted the compromise and implemented enhanced security measures, and will continue to take appropriate steps in the future to improve the security of our systems. There can be no assurances, however, that there will not be further breaches of sensitive customer information in the future.The most significant cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and computer intrusion that might result in loss of customer or proprietary data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals 28 breach and extract funds from customer or bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. Although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties, we have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of cyber-attacks. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems of us and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In particular, if personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see “Regulation and Supervision” in Part I, Item 1 — Business, included in this Annual Report. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. We rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed below under “Risks Relating to Our Relationship with EVERTEC.” The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties’ suppliers or vendors (so-called “fourth party risk”). We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed below under “Risks Relating to Our Relationship with EVERTEC.” While we select third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by a vendor, breaches of a vendor’s systems, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor’s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. 29 In addition, the assessment and management by financial institutions of the risks associated with third party vendors have been subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with our oversight of third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities. Our failure to properly manage risks associated to our third party relationships could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by our regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. Unforeseen or catastrophic events, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters or the emergence of pandemics, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Extreme weather events could be exacerbated by climate change. The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events in the markets in which we do business, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, or the emergence of pandemics could cause a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our operations are located in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI, a region susceptible to hurricanes, earthquakes and other similar events. For example, in 2017, our operations in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI were significantly disrupted by the impact of Hurricanes Irma and María. In January 2020, Puerto Rico was impacted by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake which caused island-wide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island. Future natural disasters can again cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We maintain insurance against natural disasters including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic natural disaster could produce to the markets that we serve and the potential negative impact to economic activity. Further, future natural disasters in any of our market areas could again adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may further adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. Man-made disasters, pandemics, and other events connected with the regions in which we operate could have similar effects. For example, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, resulting in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. Instances of coronavirus have begun to spread around the world. The impact of the coronavirus on our business is uncertain at this time and will depend on future developments, but prolonged closures may disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers, service providers and customers, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The severity and impact of future hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics and other similar events are difficult to predict and, in particular in the case of hurricanes, may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of climate change could also adversely impact the financial condition of our clients or the value of any collateral held by us, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  risks related to acquisition transactions Potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face, and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints.To the extent permitted by our applicable regulators, we will pursue strategic acquisition opportunities. Acquiring other banks or businesses, however, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, potential disruption to our business, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company. If in connection with an acquisition we pay a premium over book or market value, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Similarly, acquiring loan portfolios involves various risks. When acquiring loan portfolios, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In estimating the extent of the losses, we 30 analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, however, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolios, which would negatively affect our operating results.Finally, certain acquisitions by financial institutions, including us, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The failure to successfully integrate Reliable’s business and operations may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits and could adversely affect our results of operations. Incorrect assumptions and judgements regarding the fair value of the assets acquired could negatively affect our operating results.On August 1, 2018, Popular Auto, LLC, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico’s auto finance subsidiary, completed the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities related to Wells Fargo & Company’s (“Wells Fargo”) auto finance business in Puerto Rico (“Reliable”). Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisition, including synergies and operational efficiencies, in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect, will depend on the effective and timely transition and integration of Reliable’s business and operations. Problems may arise in successfully integrating Reliable’s business and operations, including, without limitation, unexpected costs as a result of any unrecorded liabilities or issues not identified during the due diligence investigation of the business and that may not be subject to indemnification or reimbursement under the acquisition agreement, any failure to comply with banking and consumer protection laws and regulations, and any adverse effects on our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees and service providers. The failure to successfully transfer and integrate Reliable’s business and operations may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits and could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, as part of the transition and integration, we may find that our assumptions and judgements regarding the fair value of the assets acquired, including the collectability of the loans and value of the collateral, could be inaccurate causing our actual losses to be higher than estimated, negatively affecting our operating results.RISKS RELATING TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERTECWe are dependent on EVERTEC for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.In connection with the sale of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a long-term Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) with EVERTEC, pursuant to which we agreed to receive from EVERTEC, on an exclusive basis, certain core banking and financial transaction processing and information technology services. The term of the MSA extends until September 30, 2025. Under the MSA, we also granted EVERTEC a right of first refusal over certain services or products and development projects related to the services thereunder provided. We also entered into several other agreements, generally coterminous with the MSA, pursuant to which BPPR agreed to sponsor EVERTEC as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations, agreed to certain exclusivity and non-solicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services, and agreed to support the ATH brand and network, among other matters. As a result, we are now dependent on EVERTEC for the provision of essential services to our business, including our core banking business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that EVERTEC will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing and technology services. As a result, our relationship with EVERTEC exposes us to a number of operational, cybersecurity and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.As a result of our agreements with EVERTEC, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of EVERTEC, including those relating to a breakdown or failure of EVERTEC’s systems or internal controls environment, as a result of security breaches or attacks, employee error or malfeasance, system breakdowns, vulnerabilities or otherwise. Over the term of the MSA, we have experienced various interruptions and delays in key services provided by EVERTEC. Future interruptions in the operation of EVERTEC’s information systems, or cyberattacks to, or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, expose us to regulatory, legal and compliance risk and 31 damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding our cybersecurity risks, refer to the “We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business” risk factor. Our ability to recover from EVERTEC for breach of the MSA may not fully compensate us for the damages we may suffer as a result of such breach. If EVERTEC is unable to meet constant technological changes and evolving industry standards, we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.The banking and financial services industry is rapidly evolving and it is highly competitive on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, innovation, price and other factors. In order to compete effectively, we need to constantly develop enhancements to our product and service offerings and introduce new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry and satisfy shifting customer needs and preferences. These enhancements and new products and services require the delivery of technology services by EVERTEC pursuant to the MSA, making our success dependent on EVERTEC’s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner. Some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than EVERTEC and that may have better technological capabilities and product offerings. Furthermore, EVERTEC is highly leveraged, which, besides exposing it to a number of financial and business risks, requires it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to meeting debt service requirements, reducing its operational flexibility and ability to invest resources in capital and other expenditures to improve and develop its business services in a constantly changing environment. In addition, financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers’ compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, and in most cases such costs are borne by the technology provider. Because of our relationship with EVERTEC, however, we may be required to bear the full cost of such developments and modifications pursuant to the MSA.If EVERTEC’s technology services are not competitive in terms of price, speed and scalability versus comparable offerings from larger companies, our future success may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if our relationship with EVERTEC hinders our ability to compete successfully, including by satisfying shifting customer needs and preferences through enhancements to our existing products and services and the introduction of new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry, our ability to attract and retain customers and to match products and services offered by competitors could be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Our ability to transition to a new financial services technology provider, and to replace the other services that are provided to us by EVERTEC, may be lengthy and complex.Switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks, even where such a switch can be accomplished without violating our contractual obligations to EVERTEC. The implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs) and business disruption. If we decided to transition to a new financial services technology provider, either at the end of the term of the MSA and related agreements or earlier upon the occurrence of an early termination thereunder, these potential transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although EVERTEC has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the MSA, we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner. Furthermore, we may require transition assistance from EVERTEC beyond the term of the MSA, delaying and lengthening any transition process away from EVERTEC while increasing related costs.Under the MSA, we are required to provide written notice of non-renewal no less than one year prior to the relevant termination date in order to avoid an automatic three-year renewal. In practice, however, if we decided to switch to a new provider, we would have to commence procuring and working on a transition process much earlier and such process may extend beyond the current term of the MSA. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.32  The value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the revenues we derive from EVERTEC, could be materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with EVERTEC or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term.We continue to have a 16.19% ownership interest in EVERTEC and account for this investment under the equity method. As such, we include our investment in EVERTEC in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. For 2019, our share of EVERTEC’s changes in equity recognized in income was $17.3 million. The carrying value of our investment in EVERTEC was, as of December 31, 2019, approximately $74 million. Meanwhile, the services EVERTEC delivers to us represent a significant portion of EVERTEC’s revenues (approximately 45% for 2019). As a result, if we were not to renew the MSA and our other agreements with EVERTEC, or otherwise terminate them before the end of their term, EVERTEC’s financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the income we report from this investment, may be materially reduced. Furthermore, revenue from EVERTEC’s merchant acquiring business, which constitutes approximately 22% of EVERTEC’s revenues, depends, in part, on EVERTEC’s alliance with BPPR. If such relationship were to suffer, EVERTEC’s business may be adversely affected.Furthermore, future sales of our EVERTEC common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of EVERTEC common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings. RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIESThe issuance of additional shares of equity securities could further dilute existing holders of our Common Stock.We have not issued equity securities since 2010, other than in connection with compensation plans or our dividend reinvestment plan. In the future, however, we may raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations or expansions, to pursue acquisitions or to increase our capital to comply with regulatory capital measures. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders would be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our Common Stock or outstanding Preferred Stock, and the issuance could be at a price which is dilutive to current stockholders. Dividends on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or Preferred Stock without selling their shares.Holders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. During 2009, we suspended dividend payments on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. We resumed payment of dividends on our Preferred Stock in December 2010 and on our Common Stock in October 2015. There can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock or Common Stock in any future periods. This could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Also, we are a bank holding company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies should pay dividends on common stock only out of the net income available to common stock over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.  In addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by each trust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our Common Stock and Preferred Stock, or from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.33  Accordingly, stockholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Stockholders may not realize a gain on their investment when they sell the Common Stock or Preferred Stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment. Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control.Our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock.For further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the Management’s Discussion & Analysis section of the Annual Report.   "

RISK FACTORS          Popular,like other financial institutions, faces a number of risks inherent to our business,financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could causeour actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated bythe forward-looking statements contained in this report.          The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks anduncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or that aregenerally applicable to all financial institutions, also may materially adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRYWeakness in the economy and in the real estate market in the geographic footprint of Popular hasadversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact Popular.          A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in theCommonwealth of Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricos economy continues to deteriorate. In addition,approximately 40% of our non-covered loan portfolio is secured by real estate located in Puerto Rico.          Since 2006, the Puerto Rico economy has been in recession. Based on information published bythe Puerto Rico Planning Board, the Puerto Rico real gross national product decreased 3.7% duringthe fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. In March 2010, the Puerto Rico Planning Board announced thatit was projecting a contraction of 3.6% in real gross national product for the fiscal year endedJune 30, 2010. According to the Puerto Rico Planning Board, the real gross national product isexpected to increase by 0.4% for the fiscal year ending June 30,2011. This figure may be revised before the conclusion of the fiscalyear.          The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government is currently addressing a fiscal deficit which inits initial stages was estimated at approximately $3.2 billion or over 30% of its annual budget. Itis implementing a multi-year budget plan for reducing the deficit, as its access to the municipalbond market and its credit ratings depend, in part, on achieving a balanced budget. Some of themeasures implemented by the government include reducing expenses, including public-sectoremployment through employee layoffs. Since the government is animportant source of employment in Puerto Rico, these measures could have the effect of intensifying the current recessionary cycle.The Puerto Rico Labor Department reported an unemployment rate of14.7% for December 2010, down from 15.4% in November, but slightlyhigher than 14.3% in December 2009. The economyof Puerto Rico is very sensitive to the price of oil in the globalmarket. Puerto Rico does not havesignificant mass transit available to the public and most of its electricity is powered by oil,making it highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. A substantial increase in its price couldimpact adversely the economy by reducing disposable income and increasing the operating costs ofmost businesses and government. Consumer spending is particularly sensitive to wide fluctuations inoil prices.          This decline in Puerto Ricos economy has resulted in, among other things, a downturn in ourloan originations, an increase in the level of our non-performing assets, loan loss provisions andcharge-offs, particularly in our construction and commercial loan portfolios, an increase in therate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans, and a reduction in the value of our loans and loanservicing portfolio, all of23Table of Contentswhich have adversely affected our profitability. If the decline ineconomic activity continues, there could be further adverse effects on our profitability.          The current state of the economy and uncertainty in the private and public sectors has had anadverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios. The persistent economic slowdown isexpected to cause those adverse effects to continue, as delinquency rates mayincrease in the short-term, until sustainable growth resumes. Also, a potential reduction inconsumer spending may also impact growth in our other interest and non-interest revenues.Further deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our construction, commercial andmortgage loan portfolios may result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results ofoperations.          Further deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction,commercial and mortgage loan portfolios may result in increased credit losses. As of December 31,2010, approximately 2%, 34% and 22% of our non-covered  loan portfolio constituted of construction,commercial secured by real estate and mortgage loans, respectively.          Substantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy.Whether the collateral is located in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British VirginIslands or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral valuebacking the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specificreal estate market. Recent economic reports related to the real estate market in Puerto Ricoindicate that certain pockets of the real estate market are subject to reductions in value relatedto general economic conditions. In certain mainland markets like southern Florida, Illinois andCalifornia, we have been seeing the negative impact associated with low absorption rates andproperty value adjustments due to overbuilding. We measure the impairment based on the fair valueof the collateral, if collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values,principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observedtransactions involving similar assets in similar locations, size and supply and demand. Anappraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal ismade. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale orforeclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by theproperty. In addition, given the current slowdown in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, theproperties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed.          Construction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential real estateproperties entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they arelarger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower andare generally more sensitive to economic downturns. As of December 31, 2010, commercial andconstruction loans secured by commercial  real estate properties, excluding loanscovered under FDIC loss share agreements, amounted to$7.5 billion or 36% of the total loanportfolio.          During the year ended December 31, 2010, net charge-offs specifically related to values ofproperties securing our construction, commercial and mortgage loanportfolios totaled $391.9million, $259.6 million and $87.5 million respectively. Continued deterioration on the fair valueof real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would require increases inPopulars provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have anadverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information onthe credit quality of our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio see the Credit RiskManagement and Loan Quality section of the Managements Discussion and Analysis included in thisForm 10-K.Difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial industry and our results ofoperations and financial condition.          Market instability and lack of investor confidence have led many lenders and institutionalinvestors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers, including other financialinstitutions. This has led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack ofconsumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity ingeneral. The resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial marketshave adversely affected our industry and our business, results of operations and financialcondition. We do not expect a material improvement in the financial environment in the near future.A worsening of these difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us andothers in the financial industry. In particular, we face the following risks in connection withthese events:  We expect to face increased regulation of our industry, including as a result of theEESA and the Dodd-Frank Act. Compliance with these regulations may increase our costs andlimit our ability to pursue business opportunities.   Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if themodels and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our customers become lesspredictive of future behavior.   The processes we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requiresdifficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditionsand how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay theirloans. The reliability of these processes might be compromised if these variables are nolonger capable of accurate estimation.24Table of Contents  Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of increasing consolidation offinancial services companies in connection with current market conditions.   The FDIC increased the assessments that we have to pay on our insured deposits during2009 because market developments have led to a substantial increase in bank failures and anincrease in FDIC loss reserves, which in turn has led to a depletion of theFDIC insurance fund reserves. We may be required to pay in the future significantly higherFDIC assessments on our deposits if market conditions do not improve or continue todeteriorate.   We may suffer higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or otherregulatory action that either (i) reduces the amount that our borrowers are required to payus, or (ii) limits our ability to foreclose on properties or collateral or makesforeclosures less economically viable.Financial services legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our businessand results of operations and on our credit ratings.          Popular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal andPuerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal or Puerto Rico laws orregulations could have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations maybe enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect Populars powers, authority andoperations, which could have a material adverse effect on Populars financial condition and resultsof operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties,have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices orviolations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretionand power would have a negative impact on Popular.          Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted ingovernment regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on thefinancial services industry. The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale,responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. Several funding andcapital programs by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury were launched in 2008 and 2009,with the objective of enhancing financial institutions ability to raise liquidity. It is expectedthat these programs may have the effect of increasing the degree or nature of regulatorysupervision to which we are subjected. These and other potential regulation and scrutiny mayorproposed legislative and regulatory changes could significantly increase our costs, impede theefficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and,limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner or otherwise adverselyaffect our results of operations or earnings.          We face increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny as a result of our participation in theTARP. Unless we have redeemed all of the trust preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury orthe U.S. Treasury has transferred all of its trust preferred securities to third parties, theconsent of the U.S. Treasury will be required for us to, among other things, increase the dividendrate per share of Common Stock above $0.08 per share or to repurchase or redeem equity securities,including our Common Stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. Popular has also grantedregistration rights and offering facilitation rights to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to which we haveagreed to lock-up periods during which it would be unable to issue equity securities. Ourparticipation in TARP also imposes limitations on the payments we may make to our senior leaders.For more details on the implications of TARP please refer to the risks factors titled as follow:Our business could suffer if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate skilled senior leadersand Dividends on our Common Stock and preferred stock have been suspended and stockholders may notreceive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or preferred stock withoutselling their shares.          On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which significantly changes theregulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Actincludes, and the regulations to be developed thereunder will include, provisions affecting largeand small financial institutions alike including several provisions that will affect how communitybanks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated in the future.          The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes new capital requirements on bank holdingcompanies; changes the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a banks average consolidated totalassets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base, and permanently raises thecurrent standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expands the FDICs authority to raiseinsurance premiums. The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise the ratio of reserves todeposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and to offsetthe effect of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than$10 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions,establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection as an independent entity within the FederalReserve, which will have broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumerfinancial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equityloans and credit cards, and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steeringincentives, determinations as to a borrowers ability to repay and prepayment penalties. TheDodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensationat all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on businesschecking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary trading, places restrictions on theowning or sponsoring of hedge and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities ofbanks and their affiliates.25Table of Contents          The Collins Amendment (Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act), which became effective on July 22,2010, will have a significant impact on current capital requirements for bank holding companiessuch as Popular, because it requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage andrisk-based capital requirements that apply on a consolidated basis for insured depositoryinstitutions and their holding companies. In effect, the Collins Amendment applies to bank holdingcompanies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that will apply to insureddepository institutions. Because the capital requirements must be the same for insured depositoryinstitutions and their holding companies, the Collins Amendment will exclude trust preferredsecurities from Tier 1 Capital, subject to phase-out from Tier 1 qualification for trust preferredsecurities issued before May 19, 2010, with the phase-out commencing on January 1, 2013 and to beimplemented incrementally over a three-year period commencing on that date. Debt or equityinstruments issued to the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof prior to October10, 2010, pursuant to the EESA, are exempted from therequirements of the Collins Amendment. Prior to the Collins Amendment, trust preferred securities(in addition to, among others, common equity, retained earnings, minority interests in equityaccounts of consolidated subsidiaries) can be included in Tier 1 capital for bank holdingcompanies, provided that not more than 25% of qualifying Tier 1 capital may consist ofnon-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other so-called restrictedcore capital elements.          These provisions, or any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislativechanges to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact theprofitability of our business activities or change certain of our business practices, including theability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achievesatisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increasedcompliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention andresources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore alsomaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Ourmanagement is actively reviewing the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, many of which are to bephased-in over the next several months and years, and assessing its probable impact on ouroperations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industryin general, and us in particular, is uncertain at this time.          A separate legislative proposal would impose a new fee or tax on U.S. financial institutionsas part of the 2010 budget plans in an effort to reduce the anticipated budget deficit and torecoup losses anticipated from the TARP. Such an assessment is estimated to be 15-basis points,levied against bank assets minus Tier 1 capital and domestic deposits. The administration has alsoconsidered a transaction tax on trades of stock in financial institutions and a tax on executivebonuses.          The U.S. Congress has also recently adopted additional consumer protection laws such as theCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, and the Federal Reserve hasadopted numerous new regulations addressing banks credit card, overdraft and mortgage lendingpractices. Additional consumer protection legislation and regulatory activity is anticipated in thenear future.          On December 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervisors of the Basel Committeeon Banking Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee, released its final framework forstrengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (Basel III). The implementation ofthe Basel III final capital framework will commence January 1, 2013. On that date, banks will berequired to meet the following minimum capital ratios: 3.5% common equity Tier 1 (CET1) torisk-weighted assets; 4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and 8.0% total capital torisk-weighted assets. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, banks will be required to maintain:a minimum 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which isadded to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratioof CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); a minimum 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weightedassets, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio asthat buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%); and aminimum 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets, plus the capital conservation buffer (which isadded to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in aminimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); a minimum leverage ratio of 3%; and a countercyclicalcapital buffer, generally to be imposed when regulators determine that excess aggregate creditgrowth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to thecapital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentiallyresulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).          The Basel III final capital framework provides for a number of new deductions from andadjustments to CET1, the implementation of which will begin on January 1, 2014 and will bephased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservationbuffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasingby that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).          The Basel III final liquidity framework requires banks to comply with two measures ofliquidity risk exposure: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, or LCR, based on a 30-day time horizonand calculated as the ratio of the stock of high-quality liquid assets divided by total net cashoutflows over the next 30 calendar days, which must be at least 100%; and the Net Stable FundingRatio, or NSFR, calculated as the ratio of the available amount of stable funding divided bythe required amount of stable funding, which must be at least 100%. Although the Basel Committeehas not asked for additional comment on the LCR and NSFR, both are subject to observation periodsand transitional arrangements, with the Basel III liquidity framework providing that revisions tothe LCR will be made by mid-2013, and the LCR will be introduced as a requirement on January 1,2015; and revisions to the NSFR will be made by mid-2016, and the NSFR will be introduced as arequirement on January 1, 2018.26Table of Contents          Such proposals and legislation, if finally adopted, would change banking laws and ouroperating environment and that of our subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannotdetermine whether such proposals and legislation will be adopted, or the ultimate effect that suchproposals and legislation, if enacted, or regulations issued to implement the same, would have uponour financial condition or results of operations. These changes may also require us to investsignificant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes.RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESSThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.          Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries andcounterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial servicesindustry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedgefunds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in theevent of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbatedwhen the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient torecover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurancethat any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations orearnings.          We have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. Werequest collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitor these ona regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by usand results in losses.          Our ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when marketconfidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion amongparticipants may increase, substantially and makes it more difficult to borrow in the creditmarkets. Our credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and our senior unsecured ratingsare now non-investment grade with the three major rating agencies. This may make it moredifficult for Popular to borrow in the capital markets and at a higher cost. Nonetheless, oursenior debt ratings were raised by Standard & Poors in May, 2010 to B with a positive outlook,from its previous level of B-. In February of 2011, Fitch raised our senior debt rating to B+with a stable outlook, from its previous level of B.We are subject to default risk in our loan portfolio.          We are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to theloans originated or acquired. We establish provisions for loan losses, which lead to reductions inthe income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which isdeemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio inaccordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to ourfinancial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about thefuture, including forecasts of economic and market conditions that might impair the ability of ourborrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimatedthe level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loanlosses in the future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasonsbeyond our control. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses inexcess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financialcondition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses andallowance for loan losses and may be required to increase such amounts.Rating downgrades on the Government of Puerto Ricos debt obligations could affect the value of ourloans to the Government and our portfolio of Puerto Rico Government securities.          Even though Puerto Ricos economy is closely integrated to that of the U.S. mainland and itsgovernment and many of its instrumentalities are investment grade-rated borrowers in the U.S.capital markets, the fiscal situation of the Government of Puerto Rico led nationally recognizedrating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations.          As a result of the fiscal challenges that were being faced, the rating agencies in 2006downgraded the debt ratings of the Commonwealth, maintaining them at investment grade.Subsequently, as a result of the progress made in balancing the budget under a multi-year plan,there have been upward revisions in the credit ratings. As part of a recalibration of its ratingsystem for municipal obligations, Moodys raised the Commonwealths credit ratings in April 2010to A3 with a stable outlook, and in August 2010 revised the ratings outlook to negative. S&Psrating of BBB remained unchanged but the outlook was improved to positive in November 2010. WhileMoodys A3 rating and S&Ps BBB take into consideration Puerto Ricos fiscal challenges, otherfactors could trigger an outlook change, such as the inability to successfully complete theimplementation of the multiyear fiscal plan to bring the Central Governments budget back intobalance, pursuant to Act No. 7 of the Commonwealth of P.R.          InJanuary 19, 2011, Fitch Ratings assigned a BBB+rating to the outstanding general obligation (GO) bonds of theCommonwealth of Puerto Rico with a stable outlook.          Factors such as the governments ability to implement meaningful steps to control operatingexpenditures and maintain the integrity of the tax base will be key determinants of future ratingsstability. Also, the inability to agree on future fiscal year Commonwealth budgets could result inratings pressure from the rating agencies.27Table of Contents          It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgradein Puerto Ricos debt obligations. However, deterioration in the fiscal situation with possiblenegative ratings implications, could adversely affect the value of Puerto Ricos Governmentobligations.          At December 31, 2010, we had $1.4 billion of credit facilities granted to or guaranteed by thePuerto Rico Government and its political subdivisions, of which $199 million were uncommittedlines of credit. Of these total credit facilities granted, $1.1 billion were outstanding atDecember 31, 2010. A substantial portion of our credit exposure to the Government of Puerto Rico iseither collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenuesidentified for its repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans topublic corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as waterand electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from theCentral Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it. We also have loans tovarious municipalities for which the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of theapplicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required bylaw to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all ofits general obligation bonds and loans. Another portion of these loans consists of specialobligations of various municipalities that are payable from the basic real and personal propertytaxes collected within such municipalities. The good faith and credit obligations of themunicipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.          Furthermore, as of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding $144.7 million in Obligations ofPuerto Rico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of our investment portfolio. Of that total,$140 million was exposed to the creditworthiness of the Puerto Rico Government and itsmunicipalities. We continue to closely monitor the political and economic situation of Puerto Ricoand evaluate the portfolio for any declines in value that management may consider beingother-than-temporary.We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subjectto recourse arrangements.          Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan untilthe time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. In the past, we haveretained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and wealso service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December 31, 2010, we serviced$4.0 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loansassociated with FNMA and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant tothe credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third partyinvestor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would berequired to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers isequivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced withrecourse and interest, if applicable. During 2010, we repurchasedapproximately $121 million inmortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by theborrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December31, 2010, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loanssold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $53.7 million. We may suffer losses on these loanswhen the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan areless than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced andthe costs of holding and disposing of the related property.Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.          In connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety ofcustomary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized.Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding forthe life of the loan, and they relate to, among other things:  compliance with laws and regulations;   underwriting standards;   the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file; and   the characteristics and enforceability of the loan.          A loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell,may impact our ability to obtain third-party financing for the loan, and be unsaleable or saleableonly at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may beobligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated toindemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available foroperations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loansare originated in accordance with the secondary markets requirements, but mistakes may be made, orcertain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchasesand losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling suchloans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resultingfrom representation and warranty violations on specific portfolios. AtDecember 31, 2010, Populars reserve for estimated losses fromrepresentation and warranty arrangements amounted to $40.9 million,which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidatedstatement of condition. Nonetheless, we do not expectany such losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they would adversely impact ourresults of operations or financial condition.28Table of ContentsIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.          During 2008 and continuing in 2009, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increasedresolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the DIF. In addition, the FDIC instituted two temporaryprograms, to further insure customer deposits at FDIC-member banks: deposit accounts are now insured up to $250,000 per customer (up from $100,000) andnon-interest-bearing transaction accounts are fully insured (unlimited coverage) as a result of ourparticipation in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program. Theseprograms have placed additional stress on the DIF.          In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the DIF, the FDICincreased assessment rates of insured institutions uniformly by 7 cents for every $100 of depositsbeginning with the first quarter of 2009, with additional changes in April 1, 2009, which requiredriskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on,among other things, secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels. In May 2009, the FDIC adopted afinal rule, effective June 30, 2009, that imposed a special assessment of 5 cents for every $100 oneach insured depository institutions assets minus its Tier 1 Capital as of June 30, 2009, subjectto a cap equal to 10 cents per $100 of assessable deposits for the second quarter 2009 risk-basedcapital assessment. This special assessment applied to us and resulted in a $16.7 million expensein our second quarter of 2009. On November 12, 2009, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring banks toprepay three years worth of premiums to replenish its depleted insurance fund. In December 30,2009, Popular prepaid $221 million and reduced our year-end liquidity at our banking subsidiaries.          With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, major changes were introduced to the FDIC depositinsurance system. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC now has until the end of September 2020 tobring its reserve ratio to the new statutory minimum of 1.35%. New rules amending the depositinsurance assessment regulations under the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted,including a final rule designating 2% as the designated reserve ratio and a final rule extendingtemporary unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction accounts maintained inconnection with lawyers trust accounts. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted regulationseffective for the 2011 second quarter assessment and payable in September 2011, which outlinesignificant changes in the risk-based premiums approach for banks with over $10 billion of assetsand creates a Scorecard system. The Scorecard system uses a performance score and loss severityscore, which aggregate to an initial base assessment rate. The assessment base also changes fromdeposits to an institutions average total assets minus its average tangible equity. We arecurrently evaluating the effect of these new regulations on our Consolidated Financial Statements.          We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDICinsurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or our capital positionis further impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recentlyincreased levels. Our expenses for 2010 were significantly and adversely affected by theseincreased premiums. These announced increases and any future increases or special assessments maymaterially adversely affect our results of operations.If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect ourfinancial condition and future results of operations          As of December 31, 2010 we had approximately $647.4 million and $58.7 million of goodwill andamortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet related to our Puerto Rico and UnitedStates operations, respectively. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired,we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review ouramortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate thecarrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factorsthat may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of thegoodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flowestimates and slower growth rates in the industry.          The goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions withregards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from theseestimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn,negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded.Critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:  selection of comparable publicly traded companies, based on nature of business, locationand size;   selection of comparable acquisition and capital raising transactions;   the discount rate applied to future earnings, based on an estimate of the cost ofequity;   the potential future earnings of the reporting unit; and   market growth and new business assumptions.          We conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill during the third quarter of 2010. Thisevaluation is a two-step process. The Step 1 evaluation of goodwill allocated to BPNA, our UnitedStates operations segment, indicated potential impairment of goodwill. The Step 129Table of Contentsfair value for the unit was below the carrying amount of its equity book value as of the September 30, 2010valuation date, requiring the completion of Step 2. Step 2 required a valuation of all assets andliabilities of the BPNA unit, including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets, todetermine the fair value of net assets. To complete Step 2, we subtracted from the units Step 1fair value the determined fair value of the net assets to arrive at the implied fair value ofgoodwill. The results of the Step 2 analysis indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the goodwill carrying value of $402 million, resultingin no goodwill impairment. As part of the monitoring process, management performed an assessmentfor BPNA at December 31, 2010 because, as mentioned above, this unit had failed the Step 1 test inthe annual goodwill evaluation. The Corporation determined BPNAs fair value utilizing the samevaluation approaches used in the annual goodwill impairment test. The determined fair value forBPNA at December 31, 2010 continued to be below its carrying amount under all valuation approaches.The fair value determination of BPNAs assets and liabilities was updated at December 31, 2010utilizing valuation methodologies consistent with the July 31, 2010 test. The results of theassessment at December 31, 2010 indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded thegoodwill carrying amount, resulting in no goodwill impairment. The results obtained in the December31, 2010 assessment were consistent with the results of the annual impairment test in that thereduction in the fair value of BPNA was mainly attributable to the reduced fair value of BPNAsloan portfolio.          If we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statementsbecause an impairment of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our resultsof operations could be adversely affected.Our business could suffer if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate skilled senior leaders          Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, andcompetition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. As TARPrecipients, we are subject to the executive compensation provisions of the EESA, includingamendments to such provisions implemented under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,which are expected to limit the types of compensation arrangements that Popular may enter into withour most senior leaders upon adoption of implementing standards by the U. S. Treasury. Ourcompetitors may be in an advantageous position to retain and attract senior leaders since we areone of only two institutions in Puerto Rico that have received TARP money and are subject to TARPrelated compensation provisions. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight bythe Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by theFDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors. Limitations on ourcompensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talentedsenior leaders in support of our long term strategy.Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. Any deficienciesin our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affectour ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions.          Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. In October2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policiesthat applies to all banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, includingPopular and our banking subsidiaries. The proposal sets forth three key principles for incentivecompensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do notencourage excessive risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of bankingorganizations. The three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensationarrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organizationsability to effectively identify and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controlsand risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. The proposal alsocontemplates a detailed review by the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive compensation policiesand practices of a number of large, complex banking organizations. Any deficiencies incompensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organizations supervisoryratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The proposalprovides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentivecompensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk tothe organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effectivemeasures to correct the deficiencies. Separately, the FDIC has solicited comments on whether toamend its risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increase assessment rateson financial institutions with compensation programs that put the FDIC deposit insurance fund atrisk, and proposed legislation would subject compensation practices at financial institutions toheightened standards and increased scrutiny.          The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators policies on executive compensation arecontinuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot bedetermined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability ofPopular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate our and their key employees.As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity.          We are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and otheroperating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include capitalizingsubsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our bankingsubsidiaries, BPPR and BPNA, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments andother distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. A failure by our bankingsubsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negativeimpact on our results of operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holdingcompany to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinarycourse of business, may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to competein the market.30Table of ContentsActions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the costof our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements inthe future and may have other adverse effects on our business.          Actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower ratedsecurities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher creditquality. At December 31, 2010, Popular had repurchase agreements amounting to $260 million thatwere subject to rating triggers or the maintenance of well-capitalized regulatory capital ratios,that call for an increase in their interest rate in the event of a rating downgrade.          The market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than forinvestment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debtsecurities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand tocomplete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly ratedsecurities.          In addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect ourrelationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of ourhedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permitcounterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them basedon our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateralrequirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitutecounterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capitallevels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. In addition,servicing, licensing and custodial agreements that we are party to with third parties, includeratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownershipinterest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings,the third parties could have the right to require Popular to engage a substitute fund custodianand/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residentialmortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us topost collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are notmaintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $163 million atDecember 31, 2010. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements.Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and whenneeded. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian fundscould reduce Populars liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination ofthose agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have anadverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of aratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage intransactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratingsremain below investment grade.We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelinesour business and financial condition will be adversely affected.          Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular andour banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets,liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulatorsregarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capitalguidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will bematerially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain well-capitalized status under theregulatory framework, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if weexperience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company and our relatedeligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and our ability to offercertain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results ofoperations could be adversely affected.Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of makingit more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors lessresponsive to stockholder control.          Our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors aredivided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders,one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and theother directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control ofthe Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be heldbefore a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate ofincorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed bythe stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds of the combined voting power ofthe outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions havethe effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board ofDirectors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourageattempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involvedand a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that apotential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount astockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock.31Table of ContentsThe resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have material adversefinancial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harmour business prospects.          We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages andpenalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remainhigh. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have materialadverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn couldseriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to the Corporations legalrisk, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings.We and our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, conduct business with financialinstitutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some ofour customers customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the targets of U.S. economicsanctions and embargoes. If we or our subsidiaries or affiliates or EVERTEC are found to havefailed to comply with applicable U.S. sanctions laws and regulations in these instances, we couldbe exposed to fines, sanctions and other penalties or other governmental investigations.          We and our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, conduct business with financialinstitutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some ofour customers customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the target of U.S. economicsanctions and embargoes, including Cuba. As U.S.- based entities, we and our subsidiaries andaffiliates, as well as EVERTEC, are obligated to comply with theeconomic sanctions regulations administeredby OFAC. These regulations prohibit U.S.- based entities from entering into or facilitatingunlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property andproperty interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government underone or more sanctions regimes. Failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes may result inmaterial fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. In addition, various state andmunicipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions oninvestments in companies that do business involving countries or entities, and this could adverselyaffect the market for our securities.          For these reasons, we have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assistus and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. EVERTEC has also donethis. These policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence ofsanctioned-country and persons involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and thedifficulties in identifying all transactions of our customers customers that may involve asanctioned country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us fromviolating applicable U.S. laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and suchviolations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results ofoperations.          In June 2010, EVERTEC discovered potential violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations(CACR), which are administered by OFAC, due to an oversight in which the screening parameters fortwo customers located in Haiti and Belize were not activated. EVERTECconducted an internal reviewand submitted a final  voluntary self-disclosure to OFAC in September2010. We have agreed to indemnify EVERTEC forclaims or damages related to the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC, includingthese potential violations of the CACR.          Separately,in November 2010 EVERTEC submitted a final  voluntary self-disclosure to OFACregarding the processing of certain Cuba-related credit card transactions involving Costa Rica andVenezuela that EVERTEC believed could not be rejected under governing local law and policies, but whichnevertheless may have not been consistent with the CACR. The voluntary self-disclosure also coveredthe transmission, through EVERTECs Costa Rica subsidiary, of data relating to debit card paymentinitiated by non-sanctioned persons traveling to Cuba. Notwithstanding therisk of violations of applicable governing local law and policies,around September 2010, EVERTEC ceased processing the credit cardtransactions and transmitting the data referred to in the twopreceding sentences. We have agreed to indemnify EVERTEC for claims or damagesrelated to these potential violations of the CACR. We cannot predict the timing, total costs orultimate outcome of any OFAC review, or to what extent, if at all, we could be subject toindemnification claims, fines, sanctions or other penalties.RISKS RELATED TO THE FDIC-ASSISTED TRANSACTIONRisks Related to the FDIC-assisted Transaction          We entered into an FDIC-assisted transaction involving Westernbank , which could presentadditional risks to our business. On April 30, 2010, BPPR acquired certain assets and assumedcertain liabilities of Westernbank from the FDIC in an assisted transaction. Although thistransaction provides for FDIC assistance to BPPR to mitigate certain risks, such as sharingexposure to loan losses (80% of the losses in substantially all the acquired portfolio will beborne by the FDIC) and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the formerWesternbank, we are still subject to some of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bankin a negotiated transaction. Such risks include risks associated with maintaining customerrelationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and withinthe timeframes we expect. In addition, because the FDIC-assisted transaction was structured in amanner that did not allow bidders the time and access to information normally associated withpreparing for and evaluating a negotiated transaction, we may face additional risks in theFDIC-assisted transaction.The success of the FDIC-assisted transaction will depend on a number of uncertain factors.          The success of the FDIC-assisted transaction will depend on a number of factors, including,without limitation:32Table of Contents  our ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired branches and to successfully retainand manage interest-earning assets (i.e., loans) acquired in the FDIC-assisted transaction;   our ability to attract new deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets in the areas previously served by the formerWesternbank branches;   our ability to control the incremental non-interest expense from the former Westernbank branches and other units in a mannerthat enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;   our ability to collect on the loans acquired and satisfy the standard requirements imposed in the loss sharing agreements; and   our ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the acquired branches.The FDIC-assisted transaction increased BPPRs commercial real estate and construction loanportfolio, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans.          With the acquisition of most of the former Westernbanks loan portfolio, the commercial realestate loan and construction loan portfolios represent a larger portion of BPPRs total loanportfolio than prior to the FDIC-assisted transaction. This type of lending is generally consideredto have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential or consumer lending,because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on thesuccessful operation or completion of the related real estate or construction project.Consequently, these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the real estatemarket and the general economy. These loans are generally less predictable, more difficult toevaluate and monitor, and their collateral may be more difficult to dispose of in a market decline.Furthermore, since these loans are to Puerto Rico based borrowers, Populars credit exposureconcentration in Puerto Rico increased as a result of the acquisition. Although, the negativeeconomic aspects of these risks are substantially reduced as a result of the FDIC loss sharingagreements, changes in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offsin connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction all of which would not be totally supported by theloss sharing agreements with the FDIC.          We acquired significant portfolios of loans in the FDIC-assisted transaction. Although theseloan portfolios will be initially accounted for at fair value, there is no assurance that the loanswe acquired will not become impaired, which may result in additional charge-offs to this portfolio.The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related tolocal residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level ofcharge-offs that we make to our loan portfolio, and consequently, reduce our net income, and mayalso increase the level of charge-offs on the loan portfolio that we have acquired andcorrespondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlledand may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if otherfavorable events occur.          Although we have entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC which provide that 80% oflosses related to specified loan portfolios that we have acquired in connection with theFDIC-assisted transaction will be borne by the FDIC, we are not protected for all losses resultingfrom charge-offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios. Additionally, the loss sharingagreements have limited terms; therefore, any charge-off of related losses that we experience afterthe term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negativelyimpact our results of operations. The loss sharing agreements also impose standard requirements onus which must be satisfied in order to retain loss share protections. The FDIC has the right torefuse or delay payment for loan losses if the loss sharing agreements are not managed inaccordance with their terms.Our decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate and ourestimated loss share indemnification asset in the FDIC-assisted transaction may be inaccurate,which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results ofoperations, and future prospects.          Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loanportfolios, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and otherassets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In the FDIC-assisted transaction,we recorded a loss share indemnification asset that we consider adequate to absorb future losseswhich may occur in the acquired loan portfolio. In determining the size of the loss shareindemnification asset, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volumeand classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economicconditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, our actual lossescould be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to differenteconomic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in futureloan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results. However, in the event expectedlosses from the Westernbank portfolio were to increase more than originally expected, the relatedincrease in loss reserves would be largely offset by higher than expected indemnity payments fromthe FDIC.          During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, retrospective adjustments were made to theestimated fair values of the covered loans to reflect new information obtained during themeasurement period (as defined by ASC Topic 805), about facts and circumstances33Table of Contentsthat existed as ofthe acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the acquisition-date fair valuemeasurements. The retrospective adjustments were mostly driven by revisions in credit lossassumptions because of new information that became available. The revisions principally resulted ina decrease in the estimated credit losses, thus increasing the fair value of acquired loans andreducing the FDIC loss share indemnification asset. Refer to the Westernbank FDIC-assistedtransaction section in the Annual Report and Note 3, Business Combination, to the consolidatedfinancial statements for additional information on the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction,including the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as information on thebreakdown and accounting of the acquired loan portfolio.Our ability to obtain reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements on covered assets depends onour compliance with the terms of the loss sharing agreements.          Management must certify to the FDIC on a monthly and quarterly basis our compliance with theterms of the FDIC loss share agreements as a prerequisite to obtaining reimbursement from the FDICfor realized losses on covered assets. The required terms of the agreements are extensive andfailure to comply with any of the guidelines could result in a specific asset or group of assetspermanently losing their loss sharing coverage. Under the terms of the FDIC loss share agreements,the assignment or transfer of the loss sharing agreements to another entity generally requires thewritten consent of the FDIC. No assurances can be given that we will manage the covered assets insuch a way as to always maintain loss share coverage on all such assets.Goodwill recorded on the FDIC-assisted transaction may increase or decrease during a one yearperiod following the FDIC-assisted transaction acquisition date.          The goodwill recorded in connection with the Westerbank FDIC-assisted transaction ispreliminary and subject to revision for a period of one year following the April 30, 2010acquisition date. Adjustments may be recorded based on additional information received after theacquisition date that may affect the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.Downward adjustments in the values of assets acquired or increases in values of liabilities assumedon the date of acquisition would increase the preliminary goodwill recorded.RISKS RELATED TO THE EVERTEC SALE TRANSACTIONWe entered into a Master Services Agreement pursuant to which EVERTEC will provide services toPopular and its subsidiaries on an exclusive basis.          As part of the EVERTEC transaction, Popular entered into a Master Services Agreement pursuantto which EVERTEC will provide various processing and information technology services to Popular andits subsidiaries on an exclusive basis. As we now rely on a third party for the provision of theseservices, there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate nor thatthe third party will continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing andtechnology services.RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIESPotential issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock could further dilute existing holdersof our Common Stock.          The potential issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock or common equivalentsecurities in future equity offerings, or as a result of the exercise of the warrant the U.S.Treasury holds, would dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders.Dividends on our Common Stock and preferred stock have been or may be suspended and stockholdersmay not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or preferred stockwithout selling their shares.          Holders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends asour Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. During 2009,we suspended dividend payments on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. In December 2010, weresumed payment of dividends on our preferred stock, subject to certain conditions agreed to withour regulators. In connection with the resumption of payment of dividends on our preferred stock,we agreed to fund the dividend payments out of newly-issued Common Stock issued to employees underPopulars existing savings and investment plans or, if such issuances are insufficient, othercommon equity capital raised by Popular. It is anticipated that sufficient Common Stock will beissued under those plans to cover the dividend payment. There can be no assurance that anydividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock in any future periods. Furthermore, unless wehave redeemed all of the trust preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury or the U.S.Treasury has transferred all of its trust preferred securities to third parties, the consent of theU.S. Treasury will be required for us to, among other things, increase the dividend rate per shareof Common Stock above $0.08 per share or to repurchase or redeem equity securities, including ourCommon Stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. Popular has also granted registration rightsand offering facilitation rights to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to which we have agreed to lock-upperiods during which it would be unable to issue equity securities.     This could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Also, we are a bank holdingcompany and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatoryconsiderations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board34Table of Contentsregarding capital adequacyand dividends. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy statementsstating that the bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only outof current operating earnings. In the current financial and economic environment, the FederalReserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividendpolicy and has discouraged dividend pay-out ratios that are at the 100% or higher level unless bothasset quality and capital are very strong.          In addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by eachtrust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying anydividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.The terms also prohibit us from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on suchstock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferralperiod has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.          Accordingly, shareholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our Common Stock orPreferred Stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Shareholders may not realizea gain on their investment when they sell the Common Stock or Preferred Stock and may lose theentire amount of their investment.For further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the Management Discussion & Analysis section of theAnnual Report.REGULATORY RISK          As a financial institution that services both foreign and domestic clients, we are required tocomply with certain anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws and economic sanctionsimposed on designated foreign countries, nationals and others. Specifically, all financialinstitutions must adhere to the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act regardingprocessing and facilitation of financial transactions. Furthermore, as a financial institution thattransacts with foreign parties and facilitates financial transactions between foreign parties, weare obligated to screen all transactions for compliance with the sanctions programs administered byOFAC. These regulations prohibit us from entering into or facilitating a transaction that involvespersons, governments, or countries designated by the U.S. Government under one or more sanctionsregimes"
9,BPOP,POPULAR INC,2010-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     Popular, like other financial companies, faces a number of risks inherent to our business,financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could causeour actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated bythe forward-looking statements contained in this report.     The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks anduncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also maymaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRYWeakness in the economy and in the real estate market in the geographic footprint of Popular hasadversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact Popular.     A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in theCommonwealth of Puerto Rico (the Island) and the Islands economy continues to deteriorate.     Since 2006, the Puerto Rico economy has been experiencing recessionary conditions. Based oninformation published by the Puerto Rico Planning Board, the Puerto Rico real gross nationalproduct decreased 3.7% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.     The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government is currently addressing a fiscal deficit which hasbeen estimated at approximately $3.2 billion or over 30% of its annual budget. It is implementing amulti-year budget plan for reducing the deficit, as its access to the municipal bond market and itscredit ratings depend, in part, on achieving a balanced budget. Some of the measures implemented bythe government include reducing expenses, including public-sector employment through employeelayoffs. Since the government is animportant source of employment on the Island, these measures could have the effect of intensifyingthe current recessionary cycle. The Puerto Rico Labor Department reported an unemployment rate of14.3% for December 2009, compared with an unemployment rate of 13.1% for December 2008.     This decline in the Islands economy has resulted in, among other things, a downturn in ourloan originations; an increase in the level of our non-performing assets, loan loss provisions andcharge-offs, particularly in our construction and commercial loan portfolios; an increase in therate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans; and a reduction in the value of our loans and loanservicing portfolio, all of which have adversely affected our profitability. If the decline ineconomic activity continues, there could be further adverse effects on our profitability.     The economy of Puerto Rico is very sensitive to the price of oil in the global market. TheIsland does not have significant mass transit available to the public and most of its electricityis powered by oil, making it highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. A substantial increasein its price could impact adversely the economy of Puerto Rico by reducing disposable income andincreasing the operating costs of most businesses and government. Consumer spending is particularlysensitive to wide fluctuations in oil prices.18Table of Contents     The level of real estate prices in Puerto Rico had been more stable than in other U.S.markets, but the current economic environment has accelerated the devaluation of properties and hasincreased portfolio delinquency when compared with previous periods. Additional economic weaknessin Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland could further pressure residential property values, loandelinquencies,foreclosures and the cost of repossessing and disposing of real estate collateral. The housingmarket has suffered a substantial slowdown in sales activity in recent quarters, as reflected inthe low absorption rates of projects financed in our construction loan portfolio.     The current state of the economy and uncertainty in the private and public sectors has had anadverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios. The persistent economic slowdown isexpected to cause those adverse effects to continue, as delinquency rates may increase in theshort-term, until sustainable growth resumes. Also, a potential reduction in consumer spending mayalso impact growth in our other interest and non-interest revenues.     However,in 2010, the Puerto Rico economy should benefit from the disbursementof approximately $2.5 billion from the American Recovery andReinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and $280.3 millionfrom the Commonwealth's local stimulus package.Difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial industry and our results ofoperations and financial condition.     Market instability and lack of investor confidence have led many lenders and institutionalinvestors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers, including other financialinstitutions. This has led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack ofconsumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity ingeneral. The resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial marketshave adversely affected our industry and our business, results of operations and financialcondition. We do not expect a material improvement in the financial environment in the near future.A worsening of these difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us andothers in the financial industry. In particular, we face the following risks in connection withthese events:  We expect to face increased regulation of our industry, including as aresult of the EESA. Compliance with these regulations may increase our costs and limit ourability to pursue business opportunities.   Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may beimpaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage andunderwrite our customers become less predictive of future behavior.   The processes we use to estimate losses inherent in our creditexposure requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments,including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economicconditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay theirloans. The reliability of these processes might be compromised ifthese variables are no longer capable of accurate estimation.   Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of increasingconsolidation of financial services companies in connection withcurrent market conditions.   The FDIC increased the assessments that we have to pay on our insureddeposits during 2009 because market developments have led to asubstantial increase in bank failures and an increase in FDIC lossreserves, which in turn has led to a depletion of the FDIC insurancefund reserves. We may be required to pay in the future significantlyhigher FDIC assessments on our deposits if market conditions do notimprove or continue to deteriorate.   We may suffer higher credit losses because of federal or statelegislation or other regulatory action that either (i) reduces theamount that our borrowers are required to pay us, or (ii) limits ourability to foreclose on properties or collateral or makes foreclosuresless economically viable.Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future to address market conditions in thefinancial industry may significantly affect our financial condition, results of operations,liquidity or stock price.     Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted ingovernment regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on thefinancial services industry. The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale,responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. Several funding andcapital programs by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury were launched in 2008 and 2009,with the objective of enhancing financial institutions ability to raise liquidity. It is expectedthat these programs may have the effect of increasing the degree or nature of regulatorysupervision to which we are subjected. Furthermore, recent economic and market events have led tonumerous proposals for legislative and regulatory reform that could substantially intensify theregulation of the financial services industry and that may significantly impact us. The proposalsinclude the following:  Establishing a federal consumer financial protection agency that would have, among other things, broad authority to regulate,and take enforcement actions against, providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services.   Requiring heightened scrutiny and stricter regulation of any financial institution whose combination of size, leverage andinterconnectedness could pose a threat to financial stability if it failed, restricting the activities of such institutions, andallowing regulators to dismantle large or systemically important banks and financial institutions, even healthy ones, if theyare considered a grave risk to the economy.19Table of Contents  Requiring large financial institutions to contribute to a fund that would be used to recover the cost of dismantling a bank orfinancial institution that is dismantled because it poses a grave risk to the economy.   Changing requirements for the securitization market, including requiring sponsors of securitizations to retain a materialeconomic interest in the credit risk associated with the underlying securitization, as well as enhanced disclosure requirementsfor asset securitizations   Tightening controls on the ability of banking institutions to engage in transactions with affiliates.   Assessing financial institutions with over $50 billion in consolidated assets with a financial crisis responsibility feeassessed at approximately 15 basis points of total assets (less Tier 1 capital and less FDIC-assessed deposits). The fee asproposed would last for at least the next ten years and has been proposed for the purpose of recovering projected losses fromthe TARP.   Limiting the size and activities of financial institutions, including proposals to repeal portions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.Amending regulatory capital standards, and increasing regulatory capital requirements, for banks and other financialinstitutions and establishing new formulaic liquidity requirements applicable to financial institutions, [including thoseproposals described above under Regulation and SupervisionCapital Adequacy].   Establishing heightened standards for and increased scrutiny of compensation policies at financial institutions.     Lawmakers and regulators in the United States and worldwide continue to consider these and anumber of other wide-ranging and comprehensive proposals for altering the structure, regulation andcompetitive relationships of financial institutions. For example, separate comprehensive financialreform plans could, if enacted, further substantially increase regulation of the financial servicesindustry and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industryto conduct business consistent with historical practices. Federal and state regulatory agenciesalso frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existingregulations are applied. Bills were introduced in both houses of Congress in the second half of2009, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a financial reform bill in December of 2009, butsimilar action has not been taken by the U.S. Senate. We cannot predict the substance final form,or impact effects on Popular, of these pending or future legislation, regulation orthe application thereof. These and other potential regulation and scrutiny mayor proposedlegislative and regulatory changes could significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency ofour internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and, limit ourability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner or otherwise adversely affect ourresults of operations or earnings.The imposition of additional property tax payments in Puerto Rico may further deteriorate ourcommercial, consumer and mortgage loan portfolios.     On March 9, 2009, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law the Special Act Declaring aState of Fiscal Emergency and Establishing an Integral Plan of Fiscal Stabilization to Save PuertoRicos Credit, Act No. 7. The Act imposes a series of temporary and permanent measures, includingthe imposition of a 0.591% special tax applicable to properties used for residential (excludingthose exempt as detailed in the Act) and commercial purposes, and payable to the Puerto RicoTreasury Department. This temporary measure is effective for tax years that commenced after June30, 2009 and before July 1, 2012. The imposition of this special property tax could adverselyaffect the disposable income of borrowers from the commercial, consumer and mortgage loanportfolios and may cause an increase in our delinquency and foreclosure rates.Financial results are constantly exposed to market risk.     Market risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the marketvalue of assets and liabilities due to interest rate volatility. Despite the varied nature ofmarket risks, the primary source of this risk to us is the impact of changes in interest rates onnet interest income.     Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on earning assets and theinterest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics ofthe assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could eitherincrease or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structureof the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities matureor reprice in that period. Any mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilitiesis known as a gap position. A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increasein interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interestrates could have a negative effect on net interest income. As of December 31, 2009, we had apositive gap position.20Table of Contents     The Federal Reserve Board lowered the federal funds target rate from 4.25% at the beginning of2008 to between 0% and 0.25% at December 31, 2008. This was one of various measures implemented bythe Federal Reserve Board to improve the flow of credit throughout the financial system. Given thatthe level of short-term rates is close to zero, a concern in the markets has been when maymonetary policy be tightened again and the possible impact on the financial markets. Thefuture outlook on interest rates and their impact on Populars interest income, interest expenseand net interest income is uncertain. The federal funds target rate stayed between 0% to 0.25%throughout 2009.     We usually run our net interest income simulations under interest rate scenarios in which theyield curve is assumed to rise and decline gradually by the same amount, usually 200 basis points.Given the fact that as of year-end 2009, some short-term rates were close to zero and some terminterest rates were below 2.0%, management has decided to focus measuring the risk of net interestincome in rising rate scenarios. The rising rate scenarios used inour market risk disclosure reflect gradual parallel changes of200 and 400 basis points during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2010. Projected netinterest income under the 200 basis points rising rate scenarioincreases by $59.8 millionwhile the 400 basis points simulation increases by $103.2 million. These scenarios were comparedagainst our flat interest rates forecast.     The market disruptions has led us to reduce substantially the useof unsecured short-term borrowings. They have been largely replaced with deposits and long-termsecured borrowings, and to a lesser extent, long-term unsecured debt. Therefore, the cost of theliabilities of Popular does not respond as quickly to changes in the levels of interest rates. OurAsset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) committee regularly reviews our interest rate riskand initiates any action necessary to maintain our potential volatility within limits.The hedging transactions that we enter into may not be effective in managing the exposure to marketrisk, including interest rate risk.     We use derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure to market risk causedby changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that we may utilize alsohave their own risks, which include: (1) basis risk, which is the risk of loss associated withvariations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and/or hedge cost; (2) credit ordefault risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to aparticular transaction to perform its obligations there under; and (3) legal risk, which is therisk that Popular is unable to enforce certain terms of such instruments. All or any of such riskscould expose Popular to losses.     Higher market volatility in the capital markets could impact the performance of our hedgingtransactions. Most hedging activity is related to protecting the market value of mortgage loansthat are segregated for future sale and derivatives positions to hedge the cost of liabilitiesissued or derivative positions with banking clients.RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESSThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.     Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries andcounterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial servicesindustry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedgefunds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in theevent of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbatedwhen the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient torecover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurancethat any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations orearnings.     We have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. Werequest collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitor these ona regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by usand results in losses.     Our ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when marketconfidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion amongparticipants increases substantially and makes it more difficult to borrow in the credit markets.Our credit ratings have been reduced substantially during the past year, and our senior unsecuredratings are now non-investment grade with the three major rating agencies. This may make it moredifficult for Popular to borrow in the capital markets and at much higher cost.Prolonged economic weakness, a continuing decline in the real estate market in the U.S. mainland,and disruptions in the capital markets have harmed and could continue to harm the results ofoperations of Popular.     The residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoyingperiods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes andindustry-wide losses. Bust cycles in the housing sector affect our business by decreasing thevolume of loans originated and increasing the level of credit losses related to our mortgage loans.21Table of Contents     The housing market in the U.S. is undergoing a correction of historic proportions. After aperiod of several years of booming housing markets, fueled by liberal credit conditions and rapidlyrising property values, since early 2007 the sector has been in the midst of asubstantial dislocation. This dislocation has had a significant impact on some of ourU.S.-based business segments and has affected our ongoing financial results and condition. Thegeneral level of property values in the U.S., as measured by several indices widely followed by themarket, has declined significantly. These declines are the result of ongoing market adjustmentsthat are aligning property values with income levels and home inventories. The supply of homes inthe market increased substantially, and property value decreases were required to clear theoverhang of excess inventory in the U.S. market. Recent indicators suggest that after a materialprice correction, the U.S. real estate market may be entering a period of relative stability.Nonetheless, further declines in property values could impact the credit quality of our U.S.mortgage loan portfolio because the value of the homes underlying the loans is a primary source ofrepayment in the event of foreclosure. In the event of foreclosure in a loan from this portfolio,the current market value of the underlying collateral could be insufficient to cover the loanamount owed.     Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses harms our ability tosell loans, the prices it receives for loans sold, and the values of our mortgage loansheld-for-sale. In addition, any material decline in real estate values would weaken Popularscollateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. Insuch event, we will be subject to the risk of loss on such mortgage assets arising from borrowerdefaults.     We maintain exposure in our U.S. loan portfolio to the housing sector. As of December 31,2009, we had $4.6 billion in residential mortgage loans in portfolio, of which $1.5 billion waslocated in the continental U.S. Further housing value declines in the U.S. would impact the levelof losses in this portfolio. Also, we have exposure to individuals in the form of home equityloans, home equity lines of credit or HELOCs, and second mortgages, which because of declininghome values have become in effect unsecured consumer loans. As of December 31, 2009, these U.S.portfolios amounted to $870 million. These portfolios are sensitive to the economic cycle in theU.S., and a further deterioration of the economy and employment conditions in the mainland wouldaffect the level of losses from this exposure.Popular operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes infederal and local laws and regulations.     Popular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and PuertoRico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal or Puerto Rico laws or regulations couldhave a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted oradopted in the future that could significantly affect Populars powers, authority and operations,which could have a material adverse effect on Populars financial condition and results ofoperations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties,have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices orviolations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretionand power may have a negative impact on Popular.Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability.     We face substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits. Thecompetition in originating loans comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico and foreign banks,mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and other institutionallenders and purchasers of loans.     In Puerto Rico, competition is primarily from other local depository institutions and fromthe local operations of several global foreign and domestic banks. As a group they compete in allsegments of the market and present a formidable source of competition for Popular. Competition isparticularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very aggressive.     In the U.S., competition is primarily from community banks operating in our footprint togetherwith the national banking institutions. These include institutions with much more resources than wehave and can exert substantial competitive pressure.     Increased competition could require that we increase the rates offered on deposits or lowerthe rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability.     The banking market in Puerto Rico experienced some consolidations on the past two decades, asa result of bank failures and voluntary intramarket transactions. Even though some institutions areno longer in existence as a result of the consolidation process, there remain six publicly-tradedlocal banking institutions, as well as a non-public local bankinginstitution, three foreign global banks and a major domestic institutioncompeting in the Puerto Rico market. Some industry experts have commented that furtherconsolidation in the Puerto Rico banking industry may be necessary or imminent. Although managementmay decide that our involvement in the consolidation of the Puerto Rico banking industry may be inour best interest, there can be no assurances that we could successfully complete a transaction, orif we did, that we could successfully integrate the operations of another banking institution intoour own operations without incurring substantial disruptions to our business.22Table of ContentsWe may engage in FDIC-assisted transactions, which could present additional risks to our business.     We may have opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks inFDIC-assisted transactions. Although these transactions typically provide for FDIC assistance to anacquirer to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providingindemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution, we would still be subject tomany of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in negotiated transactions,including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize theanticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect. In addition,because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and accessto information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated acquisition, wemay face additional risk in FDIC-assisted transactions. These risks include additional strain on managementresources, management of problem loans, problems related to integration of personnel and operatingsystems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital. We cannotassure you, that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encounteredin connection with FDIC-assisted transactions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, capital, liquidity and results fromoperations.We are subject to default risk in our loan portfolio.     We are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to theloans originated or acquired. We establish provisions for loan losses, which lead to reductions inthe income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which isdeemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio inaccordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to ourfinancial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about thefuture, including forecasts of economic and market conditions that might impair the ability of ourborrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimatedthe level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loanlosses in the future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasonsbeyond our control. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses inexcess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financialcondition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our allowance for loan losses andmay be required to increase such amounts, perhaps substantially.We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses due to our construction and commercial loansportfolios.     We have a significant portfolio in construction and commercial loans, mostly secured bycommercial and residential real estate properties. Due to their nature, these loans entail a highercredit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, may haveless collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally moresensitive to economic downturns. Rapidly changing collateral values, general economic conditionsand numerous other factors continue to create volatility in the housing markets and have increasedthe possibility that additional losses may have to be recognized with respect to our currentnon-performing assets. Furthermore, given the current slowdown in the real estate market, theproperties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed.We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties, andinaccurate or incomplete information could negatively impact our financial condition and results ofoperations.     In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers andcounterparties, we may rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties,including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representationsof customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, withrespect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in decidingwhether to extend credit to a business, we may assume that the customers audited financialstatements conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and present fairly, in allmaterial respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer.We may also rely on the audit report covering those financial statements. Populars financialconditions and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely onfinancial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.Rating downgrades on the Government of Puerto Ricos debt obligations could affect the value of ourloans to the Government and our portfolio of Puerto Rico Government securities.     Even though Puerto Ricos economy is closely integrated to that of the U.S. mainland and itsgovernment and many of its instrumentalities are investment grade-rated borrowers in the U.S.capital markets, the fiscal situation of the Government of Puerto Rico has led nationallyrecognized rating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations.     As a result of the Central Governments fiscal challenges in 2006,Moodys and S&P then downgraded the rating of its obligations,maintaining them within investment-grade levels. Since then, actions by the Government haveimproved the credit outlook. As of December 31, 2007, S&P rated the Governments generalobligations at BBB-, while Moodys rated them at Baa3- both in the lowest notch of investment grade.In November 2007, Moodys upgraded the outlook of the Commonwealths credit ratings to stablefrom negative, recognizing the progress that the Commonwealth has made in addressing the fiscalchallenges it had faced in recent years. The Commonwealth is currently implementing a multi-yearbudget plan to address the deficit.23Table of ContentsWhile Moodys Baa3 rating and S&Ps BBB-minus take intoconsideration Puerto Ricos fiscal challenges  both ratings stand one notch above non-investmentgrade  other factors could trigger an outlook change, such as the inability to successfullycomplete theimplementation of the multiyear fiscal plan to bring the Central Governments budget back intobalance, pursuant to Act No. 7 of the Commonwealth of P.R.     Factors such as the governments ability to implement meaningful steps to control operatingexpenditures and maintain the integrity of the tax base will be key determinants of future ratingsstability. Also, the inability to agree on future fiscal year Commonwealth budgets could result inratings pressure from the rating agencies.     It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgradein Puerto Ricos debt obligations. However, deterioration in the fiscal situation with possiblenegative ratings implications, could adversely affect the value of Puerto Ricos Governmentobligations.     At December 31, 2009, we had $1.1 billion of credit facilities granted to or guaranteed by thePuerto Rico Government and its political subdivisions, of which $215 million were uncommitted linesof credit. Of these total credit facilities granted, $994 million were outstanding atDecember 31, 2009. A substantial portion of our credit exposure to the Government of Puerto Rico iseither collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenuesidentified for its repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans topublic corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as waterand electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from theCentral Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it. We also have loans tovarious municipalities for which the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of theapplicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required bylaw to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all ofits general obligation bonds and loans. Another portion of these loans consists of specialobligations of various municipalities that are payable from the basic real and personal propertytaxes collected within such municipalities. The good faith and credit obligations of themunicipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.     Furthermore,as of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding $263 million in Obligations of PuertoRico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of our investment portfolio. Of that total, $258million was exposed to the creditworthiness of the Puerto Rico Government and its municipalities.Of that portfolio, $55 million are in the form of Puerto RicoCommonwealth Appropriation Bonds, of which $45 million are rated Ba1, one notch below investment grade, by Moodys, while S&P rates them as investment grade. As of December 31, 2009, the Puerto RicoCommonwealth Appropriation Bonds represented approximately $0.6 million in unrealized losses in theinvestment securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios. We continue to closelymonitor the political and economic situation of the Island and evaluates the portfolio for anydeclines in value that management may consider being other-than-temporary.We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold subject to recoursearrangements.     Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan untilthe time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. In the past, we haveretained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and wealso service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. Consequently, we may suffer losses onthese loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaultedmortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of theloan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holdingand disposing of the related property.Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.     In connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety ofcustomary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized.Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding forthe life of the loan, and they relate to, among other things:  compliance with laws and regulations;   underwriting standards;   the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file; and   the characteristics and enforceability of the loan.     A loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell,may impact our ability to obtain third-party financing for the loan, and be unsaleable or saleableonly at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may beobligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated toindemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available foroperations and liquidity. Management believes that it has24Table of Contentsestablished controls to ensure that loansare originated in accordance with the secondary markets requirements, but mistakes may be made, orcertain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchasesand losses from defectiveloans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We haveestablished specific reserves for possible losses related to repurchases resulting fromrepresentation and warranty violations on specific portfolios. Nonetheless, we do not expect anysuch losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they could adversely impact ourresults of operations or financial condition.The economic recession could reduce demand for our products and services and lead to lower revenueand lower earnings.     Popular earns revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the loans and other products andservices we sell. As the economy worsens and consumer and business spending decreases andunemployment rises, the demand for those products and services can fall, reducing our interest andfee income and our earnings. These same conditions can also hurt the ability of our borrowers torepay their loans, causing us to incur higher credit losses.Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.     During 2008 and continuing in 2009, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increasedresolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the DIF. In addition, the FDICinstituted two temporary programs, to further insure customer deposits at FDIC-member banks:deposit accounts are now insured up to $250,000 per customer (up from $100,000) andnon-interest-bearing transaction accounts are fully insured (unlimited coverage) as a result of ourparticipation in the TAGP. These programs have placed additional stress on the Deposit InsuranceFund.     In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of theDIF, the FDIC increased assessment rates of insured institutions uniformly by 7 centsfor every $100 of deposits beginning with the first quarter of 2009, with additional changes inApril 1, 2009, which required riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoringin rate adjustments based on, among other things, secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels. InMay 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule, effective June 30, 2009, that imposed a special assessmentof 5 cents for every $100 on each insured depository institutions assets minus its Tier 1 Capitalas of June 30, 2009, subject to a cap equal to 10 cents per $100 of assessable deposits for thesecond quarter 2009 risk-based capital assessment. This special assessment applied to us andresulted in a $16.7 million expense in our second quarter of 2009. On November 12, 2009, the FDICadopted a rule requiring banks to prepay three years worth of premiums to replenish its depletedinsurance fund. In December 30, 2009, Popular prepaid $221 million and reduced our year-endliquidity at our banking subsidiaries.     We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDICinsurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or our capital positionis further impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recentlyincreased levels. Our expenses for 2009 were significantly and adversely affected by theseincreased premiums. These announced increases and any future increases or special assessmentsmay materially adversely affect our results ofoperations.Popular income tax provision and other tax liabilities may be insufficient if taxing authoritiesare successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our position.     From time to time, we are audited by various federal, state and local authorities regardingincome tax matters. Significant judgment is required to determine Populars provision for incometaxes and our liabilities for federal, state, local and other taxes. Populars audits are invarious stages of completion; however, no outcome for a particular audit can be determined withcertainty prior to the conclusion of the audit, appeal and, in some cases, litigation process.Although we believe our approach to determine the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and inaccordance with ASC Topic 740  Income taxes, it is possible that the final tax authority may takea tax position that is materially different than that which is reflected in Populars income taxprovision and other tax reserves. As each audit is conducted, adjustments, if any, areappropriately recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period determined. Suchdifferences could have a material adverse effect on Populars income tax provision or benefit, orother tax reserves, in the reporting period in which such determination is made and, consequently,on the results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows for such period.Goodwill impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and futureresults of operations     We performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation for the entire organization during thethird quarter of 2009 using July 31, 2009 as the annual evaluation date. Based on the results ofthe analysis, we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of that date. The fair valuedetermination for each reporting unit performed to determine if potential goodwill impairmentexists requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Critical assumptions that are used aspart of these evaluations include:  selection of comparable publicly traded companies, based on nature of business, location and size;   selection of comparable acquisition and capital raising transactions;25Table of Contents  the discount rate applied to future earnings, based on an estimate of the cost of equity;   the potential future earnings of the reporting unit; and   market growth and new business assumptions.     In addition, as part of the monitoring process, management performed an assessment for BPNA atDecember 31, 2009. The results of the assessment at December 31, 2009 indicated that the impliedfair value of goodwill exceeded the goodwill carrying amount, resulting in no goodwill impairment.The results obtained in the December 31, 2009 assessment were consistent with the results of theannual impairment test performed in the third quarter of 2009. It is possible that the assumptions and conclusionsregarding the valuation of our reporting units could change adversely and could result in therecognition of goodwill impairment. Such impairment could have a material adverse effect on ourfuture results of operations. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $604 million ofgoodwill remaining on our balance sheet, of which $402 million was related to BPNA. Declines in ourmarket capitalization would increase the risk of goodwill impairment in 2010.Popular may face significant operational risk.     Popular is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal andcompliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions byemployees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resultingfrom faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can resultfrom Populars actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices,corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and communityorganizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect ourability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action.     We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timelyand accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systemshave been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Proceduresexist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practicesare followed. While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, dataprocessing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance thatfuture losses will not occur.Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impairour ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting inloss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price.     Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliablefinancial reports and prevent fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulationthat focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Management continually seeks to improvethese controls and procedures.     Management believes that our key internal controls over financial reporting are currentlyeffective; however, such controls and procedures will be modified, supplemented, and changed fromtime to time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments.While Management will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take immediate action toremediate any future perceived gaps, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of thesecontrols and procedures on an on-going basis. Any failure to maintain in the future an effectiveinternal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on anaccurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence,and adversely impact our business and stock price.Popular uses insurance to manage a number of risks, however not all risks might be insured orinsurance may be inadequate to cover all losses.     We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property,legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not all such risks are insured, inany given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks weface are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer maydefault on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former riskby conducting due diligence reviews on the insurers that we use and by striving to use more thanone insurer when feasible and practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement orbad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation.     A portion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a defaultinsurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that couldadversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in animmediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans onour balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If manydefault insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of afinancial impact would be amplified and the disruption to the default insurance industry couldcurtail our ability to originate new loans that need such insurance, which would result in a lossof business for us.26Table of ContentsWe rely on our systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materiallyadversely affect our operations.     Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number oftransactions. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or haveother significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. We are similarlydependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employeescauses a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or wherean individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. Thirdparties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, includingrelating to breakdowns or failures of such parties own systems or employees. Any of theseoccurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, or result inpotential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which couldmaterially adversely affect us.     If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possessionwere to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputationaldamage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if suchinformation were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information,either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information isintercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.     We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are whollyor partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical ortelecommunications outages, natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property orphysical assets. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss orliability to us. In addition, there is the risk that our controls and procedures as well asbusiness continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affectour operations and could materially adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us toexpend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing us to litigation,regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.Our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipatedrisk, which could negatively affect us.     Management of risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properlyand verify a large number of transactions and events. We have devoted resources to develop our riskmanagement policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, ourpolicies and procedures may not be comprehensive enough given current market conditions. Some ofour methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical marketbehavior or statistically based on historical models. As a result, these methods may not fullypredict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than our historical measuresindicate. Other risk management methods depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets,clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This informationmay not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.Our business could suffer if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate skilled senior leaders     Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, andcompetition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. The executivecompensation provisions of the EESA, including amendments to such provisions implemented under theAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, are expected to limit the types of compensationarrangements that Popular may enter into with our most senior leaders upon adoption of implementingstandards by the U. S. Treasury. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal ReserveBoard. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect ourcompetitors. Limitations on ourcompensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talentedleaders in support of our long term strategy.Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. Any deficienciesin our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affectour ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions.     Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. In October2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policiesthat applies to all banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, includingPopular and our banking subsidiaries. The proposal sets forth three key principles for incentivecompensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do notencourage excessive risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of bankingorganizations. The three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensationarrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organizationsability to effectively identify and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controlsand risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. The proposal alsocontemplates a detailed review by the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive compensation policies andpractices of a number of large, complex banking organizations. Any deficiencies in compensationpractices that are identified may be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings,which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The proposal providesthat enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensationarrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to theorganizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and27Table of Contentseffective measures to correct the deficiencies. Separately, the FDIC has solicited commentson whether to amend its risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increaseassessment rates on financial institutions with compensation programs that put the FDIC depositinsurance fund at risk, and proposed legislation would subject compensation practices at financialinstitutions to heightened standards and increased scrutiny.     The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators policies on executive compensation arecontinuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot bedetermined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability ofPopular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate our and their key employees.Adverse credit market conditions may continue to affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs.We may need additional capital resources in the future and these capital resources may not beavailable when needed or at all.     The credit markets, although recovering, continue to experience extreme volatility anddisruption. General credit market conditions remain challenging for most issuers, particularly fornon-investment grade issuers like us. We need liquidity to, among other things, pay our operatingexpenses, interest on our debt, maintain our lending activities and repay or replace our maturingliabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we may be forced to curtail our operations. Theavailability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions,the general availability of credit and our creditworthiness. Our cash flows and financial conditioncould be materially affected by continued disruptions in the financial markets.     We may need to raise additional debt or equity financing in the future to maintain adequateliquidity and capital resources or to finance future growth, investments or strategic acquisitions.We cannot assure you, that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we areunable to obtain additional financing, we may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity andcapital resources or to grow, make strategic acquisitions or investments.Our funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support future growth.     Our banking subsidiaries rely on customer deposits, brokered deposits and repurchaseagreements to fund their operations. In addition, Populars banking subsidiaries maintain borrowingfacilities with the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bankof New York, and have a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to quickly raisefunds under these facilities. Borrowings from the FHLB or the Fed discount window require Popularto pledge securities or whole loans as collateral. Although those banking subsidiaries havehistorically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, no assurance can begiven that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if our financial condition orgeneral market conditions were to change. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained ifour banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is notavailable to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. Finally, if we are required torely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, revenues may notincrease proportionately to cover costs. In this case, profitability would be adversely affected.However, management believes that these risks are mitigated by our banking subsidiaries status asFDIC-insured depository institutions.     Although we consider such sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs, we may seekadditional debt financing in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. There can beno assurance additional borrowings, if sought, would be available to us or, on what terms. Ifadditional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our growthand future prospects could be adversely affected.     Asmentioned above, under the section FDIC Insurance, the FDIC extended its TAGP through June 30, 2010. This program providesdepositors with unlimited coverage for non-interest-bearing transaction accounts at participatingFDIC-insured institutions. The FDICs failure to extend itsTAGP beyond June 2010, may result in a reduction of non-interest-bearing depositsat our insured banking subsidiaries. The standard insurance amount of$250,000 per depositor remains in effect through December 31, 2013.As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity.     We are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and otheroperating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include capitalizingsubsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our bankingsubsidiaries, Banco Popular and BPNA, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments andother distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. A failure by our bankingsubsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negativeimpact on our results of operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holdingcompany to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinarycourse of business, may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to competein the market.Unforeseen disruptions in the brokered deposits market could compromise our liquidity position.     As of December 31, 2009, 8% of our assets were financed by brokered deposits. Our totalbrokered deposits as of December 31, 2009 were $2.7 billion or 10% of total deposits. An unforeseendisruption in the brokered deposits market, or in our ability to seek or accept28Table of Contentsbrokered deposits, stemming from factors such as legal, regulatory or financial risks, couldadversely affect our ability to fund a portion of our operations and/or meet obligations.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options     We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our stockholders equity. As ofDecember 31, 2009, we had consolidated notes payable of approximately $2.6 billion and hadstockholders equity of approximately $2.5 billion. Our substantial indebtedness could haveimportant consequences, including:  our ability to obtain additional financing for funding our business or general corporatepurposes may be impaired, given our non-investment grade ratings;   restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions or making usmore vulnerable to financial distress in the event of a further downturn in economicconditions or our business;   a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the paymentof principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available to us for otherpurposes including expansion through acquisition, marketing and expansion of our productofferings; and   we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at acompetitive disadvantage.Actions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the costof our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements inthe future and may have other adverse effects on our business.     Actions by the rating agencies have raised the cost of our borrowings. Borrowings amounting to$350 million have ratings triggers that call for an increase in their interest rate in the eventof a ratings downgrade. For example, as a result of rating downgrades effected by the major ratingagencies in January, April, June and December 2009, the cost of servicing $350 million of oursenior debt increased by an additional 500 basis points.     Populars senior debt and preferred stock ratings are currently rated non-investment gradeby the three major rating agencies. The market for non-investment grade securities is much smallerand less liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issuepreferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not besufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than formore highly rated securities.     In addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect ourrelationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of ourhedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permitcounterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them basedon our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateralrequirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitutecounterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capitallevels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. In addition,servicing, licensing and custodial agreements that we are party to with third parties, include ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent acontractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in theunderlying mortgage loans. Failure to maintain the required creditratings, the third parties could have the right to require Popular toengage a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levelssecuring the recourse obligations. Popular services residentialmortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certaincontractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure suchrecourse obligations if our required credit ratings are notmaintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligationsapproximated $54 million at December 31, 2009. We could be requiredto post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meetadditional collateral requirements if and when needed. Therequirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the lossof custodian funds could reduce Popular's liquidity resources andimpact its operating results. The termination of thoseagreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverseeffect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratingsdowngrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactionswith us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain belowinvestment grade.We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelinesour business and financial condition will be adversely affected.     Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popularand our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets,liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulatorsregarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capitalguidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will bematerially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain well-capitalized status under theregulatory framework, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if weexperience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company and our relatedeligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and our ability to offercertain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results ofoperations could be adversely affected.29Table of ContentsWe may not have enough authorized shares of common stock if we are required to raise additionalequity capital in the future to satisfy liquidity and regulatory needs.     As a result of ongoing challenging recessionary conditions, credit losses have depleted ourtangible common equity. Given the focus on tangible common equity by regulatory authorities, ratingagencies and the market, we may be required to raise additional capital through the issuance ofadditional common stock in future periods to replace that commonequity. We issued over 357 million shares of common stock in the exchange offer that was conducted in the third quarter of2009, which left us with only a limited number of authorized and unreserved shares of common stockto issue in the future. As a result, we will need to obtain stockholder consent to amend ourcertificate of incorporation to increase the amount of authorized capital stock if we intend toissue significant amounts of common stock in the future. We cannot be assured that our stockholderswill approve such an increase.Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of makingit more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors lessresponsive to stockholder control.     Our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors aredivided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders,one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and theother directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control ofthe Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be heldbefore a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate ofincorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed bythe stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds of the combined voting power ofthe outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions havethe effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board ofDirectors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourageattempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involvedand a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that apotential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount astockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock.The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have material adversefinancial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harmour business prospects.     We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages andpenalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remainhigh. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have materialadverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn couldseriously harm our business prospects. As more fully described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, fiveputative class actions and one derivative claim have been filed in the United States District Courtfor the District of Puerto Rico and another derivative suit was filed in the Puerto Rico Court ofFirst Instance but later removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,against Popular, certain of our directors and officers and others. Although at this earlystage, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse outcome, orreasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss, it is possible that the ultimate resolutionof these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to our results of operations.RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIESOur share price may continue to fluctuate.     Stock markets, in general, and our common stock, in particular, have over the past yearexperienced, and continue to experience, increased volatility and decreases in price. The marketprice of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to the marketsentiment regarding our operations or business prospects, as well as to market fluctuations anddecreases in price that may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Increasedvolatility could result in a further decline in the market price of our common stock.     Factors that may affect such fluctuations include the following:  operating results that may be worse than the expectations of management, securities analystsand investors;   the level of Populars regulatory and common equity;   developments in our business or in the financial sector generally;   regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;   the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to becomparable to us;   announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or ourcompetitors;   changes in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets, including the markets formortgage-related securities; and30Table of Contents  changes in global financial markets, global economies and general market conditions, suchas interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations orvolatility.Additional assistance from the U.S. Government may further dilute existing holders of our commonstock.     There may be new regulatory requirements or standards, or additional U.S. Government programsor requirements or we could incur losses in the future that could result in, or require, additionalequity issuances. Such further equity issuances would further dilute the existing holders of ourcommon stock perhaps significantly.     The potential issuance of additional shares of our common stock or common equivalentsecurities in future equity offerings, or as a result of the exercise of the warrant the U.S.Treasury holds, would dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders and couldalso involve U.S. Government constraints on our operations.Dividends on our common stock and preferred stock have been suspended and stockholders may notreceive funds in connection with their investment in our common stock or preferred stock withoutselling their shares.     Holders of our common stock and preferred stock are only entitled to receive such dividends asour Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. During 2009,we suspended dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock. Furthermore, unless we haveredeemed all of the trust preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury or the U.S. Treasury hastransferred all of its trust preferred securities to third parties, the consent of the U.S.Treasury will be required for us to, among other things, increase the dividend rate per share ofcommon stock above $0.08 per share or to repurchase or redeem equity securities, including ourcommon stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. Popular has also granted registration rightsand offering facilitation rights to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to which we have agreed to lock-upperiods during which it would be unable to issue equity securities.     This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Also, we are a bank holdingcompany and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatoryconsiderations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy anddividends. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating thatthe bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of currentoperating earnings. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board hasindicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and hasdiscouraged dividend pay-out ratios that are at the 100% or higher level unless both asset qualityand capital are very strong.     In addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by eachtrust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividendsor distributions on our capital stock, including our common stock and preferred stock. The terms also prohibit us from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice ofour election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or adeferral period is continuing.     Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock or preferredstock in order to generate cash flow from your investment. You may not realize a gain on yourinvestment when you sell the common stock or preferred stock and may lose the entire amount of yourinvestment.Offerings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock in the event of liquidation, and/orpreferred equity securities, which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividenddistributions or in the event of liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our commonstock.     We may seek to increase our liquidity and/or capital resources by offering debt or preferredequity securities, including medium-term notes, trust preferred securities, senior or subordinatednotes and preferred stock. In the event of liquidation, holders of our debt securities and sharesof preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings may receive distributions of ouravailable assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilutethe holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both.     Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stockfrom time to time without any action on the part of the stockholders. Our Board of Directors alsohas the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series ofpreferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences overour common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation andother terms. If we issue preferred shares in the future that has a preference over our common stockwith respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, or if we issue preferred shares withvoting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of our commonstock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.     For further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the MD&A section ofthe Annual Report.31Table of Contents"
15,BPOP,POPULAR INC,2009-03-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     The Corporation faces a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent to our businesses,including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal and regulatory risks. The following aresome of the more important factors that could affect our businesses.Weakness in the economy and in the real estate market in the geographic footprint of Popular hasadversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact Popular.     A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated inPuerto Rico (the Island) and the Islands economy has been deteriorating.     This decline in the Islands economy has resulted in, among other things, a downturn in ourloan originations, an increase in the level of our non-performing assets and loan loss provisions,particularly in our construction loan portfolio, an increase in the rate of foreclosure loss onmortgage loans and a reduction in the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio, all of whichhave adversely affected our profitability. If the decline in economic activity continues, therecould be further adverse effects on our profitability.     TheCommonwealth of Puerto Rico government is currently facing a fiscal deficit which has been estimated atapproximately $3.0 billion or over 30% of its annual budget. It is currently reviewing alternativesfor reducing the deficit, as its access to the municipal bond market and its credit ratings depend,in part, on achieving a balanced budget. Measures that the government may implement could includereducing expenses, including public-sector employment. Since the government is an important sourceof employment on the Island, theses measures could have the effect ofintensifying the current recessionary cycle.     The economy of Puerto Rico is sensitive to the price of oil in the global market. The Islanddoes not have significant mass transit available to the public and most of its electricity ispowered by oil, making it highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. A substantial increase inits price could impact adversely the economy of Puerto Rico, by reducing disposable income andincreasing the operating costs of most businesses and government. Consumer spending is particularlysensitive to wide fluctuations in oil prices.     The level of real estate prices in Puerto Rico has been more stable than in other U.S.markets, but the current economic environment and future developmentsin Puerto Rico and the mainland U.S. could further pressureresidential property values. Lower real estate values could increase loan delinquencies, foreclosures and the cost ofrepossessing and disposing of real estate collateral.     The current state of the economy and uncertainty in the private and public sectors has had anadverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios. The continuation of the economicslowdown would cause those adverse effects to continue, as delinquency rates may increase in theshort-term, until23Table of Contentssustainable growth resumes. Also, a potential reduction in consumer spendingmay also impact growth in our other interest and non-interest revenue sources.Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented.     The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than18 months. In recent months, the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels. Themarkets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and creditavailability for almost all issuers, often without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength. If current levels ofmarket disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that the Corporationwill not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on its ability to access capital andon its business, financial condition and results of operations.     High levels of market volatility could impact adversely the pricing of the Corporationsassets. As part of our business, the Corporation sells financial assets in the capital markets toraise liquidity and manage its risk position. High amounts of volatility increase the probabilitythat assets may be disposed of at a loss or at a lower gain than anticipated. Also, part of thevaluation of the Corporations financial assets is recognized in its financial statements and asmarket conditions become more volatile, its earnings and capital could be adversely impacted.     The Corporation raises part of its liquidity in the capital markets. When market conditionsare unsettled, providers of liquidity become more risk averse and less willing to assume risk withcounterparties. Thereby, periods of high market volatility could make it more difficult and morecostly to raise financing, impacting our financial results.Currentmarket developments have adversely affected the Corporations industry, business and results of operations.     Dramatic declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosuresand unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financialinstitutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks,and also in sales of those assets at significantly discounted prices. These write-downs, initiallyof mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securitieshave caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger andstronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of thefinancial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutionalinvestors have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers including otherfinancial institutions. The resulting lack of available credit, lack of confidence in the financialsector, increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity materiallyand adversely affect the Corporations business, financial condition and results of operations.     The decline in housing prices in the U.S. has affected the Corporations credit costs substantially asdelinquencies, and foreclosures have increased, together with the costs related to these. Lossesrelated to the decline in housing values have increased at the Corporation due to credit losses andlosses in the sale of foreclosed assets. The Corporation still have loan portfolios exposed to the U.S.housing sector and most market participants expect the housing sector to remain under pressureuntil after the end of 2009.     Recentmarket developments have changed the way in which the Corporationfinance its operations and haveimpacted its funding flexibility. The availability of borrowed funds, particularly short-termfunds, has decreased substantially and its cost has risen markedly. The Corporation has reduced theamount of funds it borrows in favor of increasing deposits and longer-term sources of capital suchas senior debt and preferred stock. Future developments may reducefunding options available to the Corporationand may increase the cost of raising financing.Thesoundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect theCorporation.     Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,counterparty, or other relationships. The Corporation has exposure to many different industries andcounterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial servicesindustry, including brokers and dealers,24Table of Contentscommercialbanks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Corporation to credit risk in theevent of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, the Corporation credit risk may be exacerbatedwhen the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient torecover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to the Corporation.There can be no assurance that anysuch losses would not materially and adversely affect its results of operations or earnings.     TheCorporation has procedures in place to mitigate the impact of adefault among itscounterparties. The Corporation requests collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutionsand monitor these on a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation ofcollateral held by the Corporation and results in losses.     The Corporations ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when marketconfidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion amongparticipants increases substantially and makes it more difficult to borrow in the credit markets.A prolonged economic slowdown, a continuing decline in the real estate market in the U.S. mainland,and ongoing disruptions in the capital markets have harmed and could continue to harm the resultsof operations of Popular, Inc.     The residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoyingperiods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes andindustry-wide losses. Bust cycles in the housing sector affect the Corporations business by decreasing thevolume of loans originated and increasing the level of credit losses related to its mortgage loans.     The housing market in the U.S. is undergoing a correction of historic proportions. After aperiod of many years of booming housing markets, fueled by liberal credit conditions and rapidlyrising property values, since early 2007 the sector has been in the midst of a substantialdislocation. This dislocation has had a significant impact on some ofthe Corporations U.S.-based businesssegments and has affected its ongoing financial results and condition. The generallevel of property values in the U.S., as measured by several indices widely followed by the market,has declined significantly. These declines are the result of ongoing market adjustments that are aligningproperty values with income levels and home inventories. The supply of homes in the market hasincreased substantially, and additional property value decreases may be required to clear theoverhang of excess inventory in the U.S. market. Declining property values could impact the creditquality of  the Corporations U.S. mortgage loan portfolio because the value of the homes underlying the loans isa primary source of repayment in the event of foreclosure. In the event offoreclosure in a loan from this portfolio, the current market valueof the underlying collateral could be insufficient to cover the loan amount owed.     Any sustained period ofincreased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses harms theCorporations  abilityto sell loans, the prices it receives for loans sold, and the values of its mortgage loansheld-for-sale. In addition, any material decline in real estate values would weaken the Corporations collateralloan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In such event, the Corporationwill be subject to the risk of loss on such mortgage assets arising from borrower defaults.      The Corporation maintains exposure in its U.S. loan portfolio to the housing sector. As of December 31,2008, the Corporation had $4.6 billion in residential mortgage loans in portfolio, of which $1.7billion was located in the continentalU.S. Further housing value declines in the U.S. could impact the level of losses in this portfolio.Also, the Corporation has exposure to individuals in the form of home equity loans (home equity lines of creditor HELOCs), which because of declining home values have become in effect unsecured consumer loans. This portfolio is sensitive to theeconomic cycle in the U.S., and a further deterioration of the economy and employment conditions inthe mainland could affect the level of losses from this exposure. As of December 31, 2008 theCorporation had $573 million in HELOCs.25Table of ContentsFinancial results are constantly exposed to market risk.     Market risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the marketvalue of assets and liabilities due to interest rate volatility. Despite the varied nature ofmarket risks, the primary source of this risk to us is the impact of changes in interest rates onnet interest income.     Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on earning assets and theinterest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics ofthe assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could eitherincrease or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structureof the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities matureor reprice in that period. Any mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilitiesis known as a gap position. A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increasein interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interestrates could have a negative effect on net interest income. As of December 31, 2008, the Corporationhad a positive gap position.     The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target rate between400 and 425 basis points from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. The Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve has also expressed concerns about a variety of economic conditions, as well aspossible further reductions of interest rates in future periods. Many of the Corporationscommercial loans are variable-rate and, accordingly, rate decreases may result in lower interestincome to Popular in the near term; however, depositors will continue to expect reasonable rates ofinterest on their accounts, potentially compressing net interest margins further. The futureoutlook on interest rates and their impact on Populars interest income, interest expense and netinterest income is uncertain.     The Corporation usually runs its net interest income simulations under interest rate scenariosin which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline gradually by the same amount,usually 200 basis points. Given the fact that as of year-end 2008, some short-term rates were close to zeroand some term interest rates were below 2.0%, management has decided to focus measuring the risk of net interest income in rising rate scenarios. The rising rate scenarios used were gradual parallelchanges of 200 and 400 basis points during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2009. Projected net interest income under the 200 basis points scenario rising rate scenario increased by $50.9 million while the 400 basis pointssimulation increased by $90.8 million. These scenarios were compared against the Corporation flat interest rates forecast.     The market disruptions discussed in other sections has led the Corporation to reduce substantiallyits use of unsecured short-term borrowings. They have been largely replaced with deposits andlonger-term secured borrowings, and to a lesser extent, longer-term unsecured debt. Therefore, thecost of the liabilities of the Corporation does not respond as quickly to changes in the levels ofinterest rates. The Corporations Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) committee regularly reviews the Corporations interest raterisk and initiates any action necessary to maintain its potential volatility within limits.26Table of ContentsThe hedging transactions that the Corporation enters into may not be effective in managing theexposure to market risk, including interest rate risk.     The Corporation uses derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure tomarket risk caused by changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that theCorporation may utilize also have their own risks, which include: (1) basis risk, which is the riskof loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and/or hedgecost; (2) credit or default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of thecounterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations there under; and (3) legalrisk, which is the risk that the Corporation is unable to enforce certain terms of suchinstruments. All or any of such risks could expose the Corporation to losses.     Highermarket volatility in the capital markets could impact the performance of the Corporations hedgingtransactions. Most hedging activity is related to protecting the market value of mortgage loansthat are segregated for future sale and derivatives positions to hedge the cost of liabilitiesissued or derivative positions with banking clients.Reductions in the Corporations credit ratings or those of any of its subsidiaries would increasethe cost of borrowing funds and make the Corporations ability to raise new funds or renew maturingdebt more difficult.     Creditratings are an important component of the Corporations liquidity profile. Among other factors,credit ratings are based on the financial strength, the credit quality of and concentrations in itsloan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of management,the liquidity of its balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail andcommercial deposits, and the ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources.     In February 2009, Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) downgraded by one notch to Baa1 the Corporationssenior debt rating and by one notch its preferred stock rating to Baa3. The lead bank, BancoPopular, is rated C+ for bank financial strength and A2 for long-term deposits. The outlook isnegative. Moodys report indicated that the downgrade of Populars ratings was prompted by thedeterioration in the Corporations asset quality and profitability in 2008, and the prospect ofcontinuing weakness in these metrics in 2009. Such weakness could further undermine Populars ratioof tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, which the rating agency indicated wascomparatively weak. Moodys believes that the deepening of the recession in the U.S. and thecontinuation of the recession in Puerto Rico, will most likely cause Populars asset qualityindicators, and hence its profitability, to remain pressured through 2009.     Fitch Ratings reduced the Corporations ratings in January 2009 as follows: the senior debtrating was cut two notches to BBB, the preferred stock rating was cut three notches to BB+ andthe short-term rating was maintained at F2. The outlook is negative. Fitch indicated thecontinued credit quality deterioration and the expectations for ongoing pressure in the real estateloan portfolios as the principal factors considered in the downgrade given recent trends in coreoperating performance and the difficult outlook.     In January 2009, Standard and Poors revised the Corporations ratings as follows: the seniordebt rating was cut by two notches to BBB-, the preferred stock rating was decreased by twonotches to BB and the short-term rating was cut to A3. The outlook is stable. S&P indicatedthat the rating action resulted from several factors, including among the principal ones theCorporations reported net operating losses, a continued deterioration in credit quality, and anexpected decline in capital ratios. S&P is also concerned by the increase in nonperforming assetsand the potential for further deterioration, notably in the construction, mortgage, and commercial loan portfolios, as they see continued pressure on homeprices and reduced sale activity. S&P views capital as adequate, but foresee more downward pressurein 2009.     Changesin the Corporations credit ratings or the credit ratings of any of its subsidiaries to a levelbelow investment grade would adversely affect its ability to raise funds in the capital marketsand adversely affect its cost of funds and related margins andliquidity. The Corporations counterparties arealso sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade.27Table of Contents     Asof December 31, 2008, the Corporation had $350 million in senior debt issued by the bank holdingcompanies with interest that adjusts in the event of senior debt ratings downgrades. As a result ofthe actions taken by the ratings agencies in 2009, the cost of that debt increased by 50 basispoints, which would represent an increase in the yearly interest expense of approximately $1.75million.     The senior debt ratings downgrades summarized above will make it more difficult and costly toraise unsecured senior debt in the capital market. Although the Corporation continues to be investment grade, theliquidity of the capital market for senior bank debt continues impaired for all but the most highlyrated and well known financials.     As previously mentioned, among the recent federal government programs announced in late 2008to assist the banking industry, the TLGP permits bank holding companies and banks to issue seniordebt under certain conditions, with a guarantee by the FDIC. In addition, the TLGP provides an FDICguarantee on non-interest bearing transaction accounts with no limit until December 31, 2009. TheCorporation has enrolled in both programs.     The Corporations preferred stock rating is currently non-investment grade under two ratingagencies. The market for non investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than forinvestment grade securities. Therefore, if the Corporation were to attempt to issue preferred stockin the capital markets, it is possible that there not be sufficient demand to complete atransaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities.     Populars ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits depends on variousfactors, including service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by the operatingresults and credit ratings by nationally recognized credit agencies. Our ratings are subject tochange at any time at the sole discretion of the rating agencies without previous notice. Adowngrade in credit ratings may impact the ability to raise deposits, but we believe that theimpact should not be material. Deposits at all of the Corporations banking subsidiaries are federally insured(subject to limitations established by the FDIC), which together with the TLGP, is expected tomitigate the effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.The Corporation is subject to default risk in its loan portfolio.     The Corporation is subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures withrespect to the loans originated or acquired. The Corporation establishes provisions for loanlosses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowancefor loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon anassessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures andguidelines. This process, which is critical to the Corporations financial results and condition, requiresdifficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic andmarket conditions that might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay the loans. There can beno assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that theCorporation will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in the future as a result offuture increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond its control.The Corporation may have more credit risk and higher credit losses due to its construction andcommercial loans portfolios.     The Corporation has a significant portfolio in construction and commercial loans, mostlysecured by commercial and residential real estate properties. Due to their nature, these loans entail a higher credit riskthan consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, concentrate more risk in a singleborrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. Rapidly changing collateralvalues, general economic conditions and numerous other factors continue to create volatility in thehousing markets and have increased the possibility that additional losses may have to be recognizedwith respect to the Corporations current nonperforming assets. Furthermore, given the currentslowdown in the real estate market, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to disposeof, if foreclosed.28Table of ContentsIncreased reserves may be required due to changes in collateral valuations     The performance of the loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions aregreatly dependent upon the condition of the real estate market in which the collateral is located.Recent economic reports indicate that real estate market values have been declining mainly due tothe experienced decrease in the purchasing power of the consumers and the existing general economicconditions. A significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans mayrequire increases in the Corporations provision for loan losses, which would have an adverseeffect on the future financial condition and results of operations.The Corporation operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changesin federal and local laws and regulations.     The Corporation is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal andPuerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal or Puerto Rico laws orregulations could have a substantial impact on its operations. Additional laws and regulations maybe enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect the Corporations powers,authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financialcondition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisoryand enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe andunsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of thisregulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on the Corporation.Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporationsprofitability.     The Corporation faces substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits.The competition in originating loans comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico and foreignbanks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and otherinstitutional lenders and purchasers of loans. Certain of the Corporations competitors are notsubject to the same extensive regulation that governs the Corporations business.     In, Puerto Rico, competition is primarily from other local depository institutions and fromthe local operations of several global banks and major U.S. money center banks. As a group theycompete in all segments of the market and present a formidable source of competition for theCorporation. Competition is particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is veryaggressive.     In the U.S., competition is primarily from community banks operating in the Corporations footprint togetherwith the national banking institutions. These include institutions with much more resources than wehave and can exert substantial competitive pressure.     Increased competition could require that the Corporation increase the rates offered ondeposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect its profitability.Rating downgrades on the Government of Puerto Ricos debt obligations could affect the value of theCorporations loans to the Government and its portfolio of Puerto Rico Government securities.     Even though Puerto Ricos economy is closely integrated to that of the U.S. mainland and itsgovernment and many of its instrumentalities are investment grade-rated borrowers in the U.S.capital markets, the fiscal situation of the Government of Puerto Rico has led nationally recognizedrating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations.     As a result of the Governments fiscal challenges in 2006, Moodys and S&P then downgraded therating of its obligations, but maintaining them within investment-grade levels. Since then, actionsby the Government have improved the credit outlook. As of December 31, 2007, S&P rated theGovernments general obligations at BBB-, while Moodys rated them at Baa3- both in the lowest notchof investment grade. In November 2007, Moodys upgraded the outlook of the Commonwealths creditratings to stable29Table of Contentsfrom negative In justifying their change in outlook, Moodys recognized theprogress the Commonwealth has made in addressing the fiscal challenges it has faced in recentyears. However, in the current fiscal year, the Commonwealth is confronting a substantial deficitand is currently reviewing options to confront the problem. While Moodys Baa3 rating and S&PsBBB-minus take into consideration Puerto Ricos fiscal challenges  both ratings stand one notchabove non-investment grade  other factors could trigger an outlook change, such as thegovernments ability to implement meaningful steps to curb operating expenditures or if the declinein government revenues continues for a longer time period.     Factors such as the governments ability to implement meaningful steps to curb operatingexpenditures, improve managerial and budgetary controls, and eliminate the governments reliance onoperating budget loans from the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico will be key determinantsof future ratings stability. Also, the inability to agree on future fiscal year Commonwealthbudgets could result in ratings pressure from the rating agencies.     It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgradein Puerto Ricos debt obligations. However, a deterioration in the fiscal situation with possiblenegative ratings implications, could adversely affect the value of Puerto Ricos Governmentobligations.     AtDecember 31, 2008, the Corporation had $1.0 billion of credit facilities granted to orguaranteed by the P.R. Government and its political subdivisions, of which $215 million wereuncommitted lines of credit. Of these total credit facilities granted, $943 million in loans wereoutstanding at December 31, 2008. A substantial portion of the Corporations credit exposure to the Government of Puerto Rico areeither collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenuesidentified for its repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans topublic corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as waterand electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from theCentral Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it. The Corporation alsohas loans to various municipalities for which the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power ofthe applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are requiredby law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of allof its general obligation bonds and loans. Another portion of these loans consists of specialobligations of various municipalities that are payable from the basic real and personal propertytaxes collected within such municipalities. The good faith and credit obligations of themunicipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.     Furthermore, as of December 31, 2008 the Corporation had outstanding $386 million inObligations of Puerto Rico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of its investment portfolio.Of that total, $363 million was exposed to the creditworthiness of the P.R. Government and itsmunicipalities. Of that portfolio, $47 million was in the form of Puerto Rico CommonwealthsAppropriation Bonds, which are currently rated Ba1, one notch below investment grade, by Moodysand BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating, by S&P. At December 31, 2008, the Appropriation Bonds indicated above represented approximately$3.2 million in unrealized losses in the Corporations portfolio of investment securitiesavailable- for- sale. The Corporation is closely monitoring the political and economic situation ofthe Island and evaluates the portfolio for any declines in value that management30Table of Contentsmay consider being other- than- temporary. Management has the intent and ability to hold these investments for areasonable period of time or up to maturity for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to (orbeyond) the cost of these investments.The Corporations share price may continue to fluctuate.     Stock markets, in general, and the Corporations Common Stock, in particular, have over the past yearexperienced, and continue to experiencing, increased volatility and decreases in price. The marketprice of the Corporations Common Stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to the marketsentiment regarding its operations or business prospects, as well as to market fluctuations anddecreases in price that may be unrelated to its operating performance or prospects. Increasedvolatility could result in a further decline in the market price ofthe Corporations Common Stock.     Factors that may affect such fluctuations include the following:     The market price of the Corporations Common Stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to achange in sentiment in the market regarding its operations or business prospects. Risk factors mayinclude the following: operating results that may be worse than the expectations of management, securities analysts andinvestors; the level of the Corporations regulatory and common equity; developments in its  business or in the financial sector generally; regulatory changes affecting its  industry generally or its business and operations; the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to becomparable to it; announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by it or the Corporationscompetitors; changes in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets, including the markets formortgage-related securities; and changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such asinterest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.     The agreements with the U.S. Treasury imposerestrictions and obligations on the Corporation that limit theability to increase dividends, repurchase Common Stock or preferred stock and access the equitycapital markets.     In December 2008, the Corporation issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase its CommonStock to the Treasury as part of its TARP Capital Purchase Program. The terms of thepreferred shares include, subject to certain exceptions, a restriction on paying dividends for bothpreferred shares equal or junior to U.S. Treasury investment and common shares unless theCorporation is current in the dividend payment to the Treasury. In addition, prior to December 5,2011, unless we have redeemed all of the preferred stock or the Treasury has transferred allof the preferred stock to a third party, the consent of the Treasury will be required to the Corporationto, among other things, increase its Common Stock dividend or repurchase its Common Stock or otherpreferred stock (with certain exceptions, including the repurchase ofits Common Stock to offsetshare dilution from equity-based employee compensation awards). The Corporation have also granted registrationrights and offering facilitation rights to the  Treasury pursuant to which the Corporation have agreed to lock-up periods during which it would be unable to issueequity securities.Youmay not receive dividends on the Common Stock.     Holdersof the Corporations Common Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as its Board ofDirectors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although the Corporation havehistorically declared cash dividends on its Common Stock, the Corporation is not required to do so, and it hasreduced the amount of cash dividends payable on its Common Stock twotimes in recent months. Any reduction of, or a futureelimination of its Common Stock dividend could adversely affect the market price ofthe Corporations Common Stock.31Table of Contents     Aspreviously mentioned, the Corporations issuance of senior preferred shares to the U.S. Treasury underthe TARP Capital Purchase Program also imposes restrictions on its ability to pay dividends undercertain conditions.TheCorporation income tax provision and other tax liabilities may be insufficient if taxing authorities aresuccessful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to theCorporations position.     Fromtime to time, the Corporation is audited by various federal, state and local authorities regardingincome tax matters. Significant judgment is required to determine the Corporations provision for income taxesand its liabilities for federal, state, local and other taxes. The Corporations audits are in various stages ofcompletion; however, no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior tothe conclusion of the audit, appeal and, in some cases, litigationprocess. Although the Corporation believes itsapproach to determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance withStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and FASBInterpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, it is possible that the finaltax authority will take a tax position that is materially different than that which is reflected inthe Corporations income tax provision and other tax reserves. As each audit is conducted, adjustments, if any,are appropriately recorded in its Consolidated Financial Statements in the period determined. Suchdifferences could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations income tax provision or benefit, or othertax reserves, in the reporting period in which such determination ismade and, consequently, on theresults of operations, financial position and/or cash flows for such period.Certain of the provisions contained in the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation have theeffect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board ofDirectors less responsive to stockholder control.     The Corporations certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board ofDirectors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting ofstockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-yearterm, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore,control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetingsmust be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. TheCorporations certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board ofDirectors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds ofthe combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election ofdirectors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board ofDirectors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. Theseprovisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire the Corporation becauseof the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result,may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capitalstock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer forthe Corporations capital stock.Goodwillimpairment could have a material adverse effect on the Corporationsfinancial condition and future results of operations     TheCorporation performed the annual goodwill impairment evaluation forthe entire organization during the third quarter of 2008 usingJuly 31, 2008 as the annual evaluation date and performed aninterim goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2008for BPNA. Based on the results of these analyses, managementconcluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of these dates.The fair value determination for each reporting unit performed todetermine if potential goodwill impairment exists requiresmanagement to make estimates and assumptions. Critical assumptionsthat are used as part of these evaluations include:selection of comparable publicly traded companies, based onnature of business, location and size;selection of comparable acquisition and capital raisingtransactions;the discount rate applied to future earnings, based on anestimate of the cost of equity;the potential future earnings of the reporting unit; andmarket growth and new business assumptions.     Tovalidate the reasonableness of the results of the annual impairmentevaluation, management performed a reconciliation of the aggregatefair values determined for the reporting units to the marketcapitalization of the Corporation and concluded that the fair valueresults determined for the reporting units in the annual test werereasonable. It is possible that the assumptions and conclusionsregarding the valuation of the Corporations reporting unitscould change adversely and could result in the recognition of goodwillimpairment. Such impairment could have a material adverse effect on theCorporations future results of operations. As of December 31,2008, the Corporation had approximately $606 million of goodwillremaining on its balance sheet, of which $404 million was related toBPNA. Declines in the Corporations market capitalizationincrease the risk of goodwill impairment in 2009.TheCorporations business could suffer if it is unable to attract,retain and motivate skilled senior leaders     TheCorporations success depends, in large part, on its ability toretain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaderscan be intense in most areas of the Corporations business. Theexecutive compensation provisions of the EESA, including amendmentsto such provisions implemented under the American Recovery andReinvestment Act of 2009, are expected to limit the types ofcompensation arrangements that the Corporation may enter into withits most senior leaders upon adoption of implementing standards bythe Treasury. These standards, and any further legislation orregulation restricting executive compensation, could have a negativeimpact on the Corporations ability to attract and retaintalented leaders in support of the Corporations long termstrategy.32Table of Contents     For further information of other risks faced by the Corporation please refer to the MD&Asection of the Annual Report"

RISK FACTORS     Weaknessin the economy and in the real estate market in the geographicfootprint of Popular has adversely impacted and may continue toadversely impact Popular.     Asignificant portion of the Corporations financial activitiesand credit exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico (theIsland) and the Islands economy has beendeteriorating. If the decline in economic activity continues, thiscould result in, among other things, a downturn in loan originations,an increase in the level of non-performing assets, an increase in therate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans and a reduction in thevalue of the Corporations loans and loan servicing portfolio,all of which would adversely affect the Corporations profitability.     ThePuerto Rico Planning Board registered a contraction of1.4 percent for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 andprojects a further decline of 1.8 percent for the current fiscalyear ending June 30, 2008.23Table of Contents     The current state of the economy and uncertainty in the private and public sectors has had anadverse effect on the credit quality of the Corporations loan portfolios. The continuation of theeconomic slowdown could cause those adverse effects to continue, as delinquency rates may increasein the short-term, until more sustainable growth resumes. Also, a potential reduction in consumerspending may also impact growth in other interest and non interest revenue sources of theCorporation.Aprolonged economic slowdown, a continuing decline in the real estate market in the U.S. mainland,and ongoing disruptions in the capital markets have harmed and could continue to harm the resultsof operations of PFH, one of the Corporations business segments.     The residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoyingperiods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes andindustry-wide losses. Bust cycles in the housing sector affect our business by decreasing thevolume of loans originated and increasing the level of credit losses related to our mortgage loans.24Table of Contents     The housing market in the U.S. is undergoing a correction of historic proportions. After aperiod of several years of booming housing markets, fueled by liberal credit conditions and rapidlyrising property values, since early 2007, the sector has been in the midst of a substantialdislocation, since 2007. It has had a significant impact on some of the Corporations U.S-basedbusiness sectors and has the potential to affect its ongoing financial results and condition. Thegeneral level of property values in the U.S., as measured by several indices widely followed by themarket, has declined. These declines are the result of ongoing market adjustments that are aligningproperty values with income levels and home inventories. The supply of homes in the market hasincreased substantially, and additional property value decreases may be required to clear theoverhang of excess inventory in the U.S. market. Declining property values could impact the creditquality of the Corporations U.S. mortgage loan portfolio because the value of the homesunderlying the loans is a primary source of repayment in the event of foreclosure. It is possiblethat in the event of foreclosure in a loan from this portfolio, the current market value of theunderlying collateral is insufficient to cover the loan amount owed.     The exposure of the Corporations loan portfolio to the 1-4 family residential mortgage sectorin the U.S. has declined. As of December 31, 2007, mortgage loans collateralized by 1-4 familyresidential property in the continental U.S. amounted to $4.7 billion, as compared to $9.2 billionas of December 31, 2006. This represents a decrease of $4.5 billion, or 49%. As of year-end 2007,$2.4 billion in 1-4 family residential mortgage loans in the U.S. were at PFH and $2.3 billion atBPNA.     TheCorporation has made loans to borrowers that had FICO scores 660 orbelow through itssubsidiary PFH. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 75% of PFHs mortgage loan portfolio of $1billion was subprime, meaning that it had a credit score per loan of 660 or below. This profile ofborrower has been particularly affected by the current housing environment. Even though theCorporation has exited this business segment, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losseson the remaining loans in portfolio could continue rising in the current environment. Risingunemployment, higher interest rates on mortgage loans, declines in housing prices and an overalltightening of credit standards by lenders tend to have a greater negative effect on the ability ofsuch borrowers to repay their mortgage loans.     Anadditional risk factor related to the residential mortgage loan sector is the repricing ofadjustable rate mortgage loans (ARMs). Of the subprime mortgage loans held-in-portfolio at PFH asof year-end 2007, $320 million or 32% were ARMs. These loans typically have a low fixed rate foran initial period (two or three years) and afterwards the rate floats or adjusts periodicallybased on a market rate of interest, such as LIBOR. Many of the ARMs currently outstanding areschedule to reset before the end of 2008. It is possible that in some of these loans, when ratesadjust, there will be a substantial increase in the underlying loan payment, possibly enough topressure the cash flow of the underlying debtor and increase thelikehood of delinquency.     Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could harm theCorporations ability to sell loans, the prices it receives for its loans, the values of itsmortgage loans held-for-sale or its residual interests in securitizations, which could harm theCorporations financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any material decline inreal estate values would weaken the Corporations collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase thepossibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In such event, the Corporation will be subject to therisk of loss on such mortgage assets arising from borrower defaults, to the extent not covered bythird-party credit enhancement.     Referto the Managements Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K for further information onPFHs credit exposure associated with its subprime mortgage loan portfolio and the RestructuringPlan executed in 2007, which has reduced the Corporations exposure in this industry sector.A prolonged economic downturn or recession would likely result in an increase in delinquencies,defaults and foreclosures and in a reduction of the loan origination activity which would adverselyaffect the Corporations financial results.     A period of reduced economic growth or a recession has historically resulted in a reduction inlending activity and an increase in the rate of defaults in commercial loans, consumer loans andresidential25Table of Contentsmortgages. A recession may have a significant adverse impact on the net interest income andfee income. The Corporation may also experience significant losses on the loan portfolio due to ahigher level of defaults on commercial loans, consumer loans and residential mortgages.Financial results are constantly exposed to market risk.     Market risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the marketvalue of assets and liabilities due to interest rate volatility. Despite the varied nature ofmarket risks, the primary source of this risk to the Corporation is the impact of changes ininterest rates on net interest income.     Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on earning assets and theinterest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics ofthe assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could eitherincrease or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structureof the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities matureor reprice in that period. Any mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilitiesis known as a gap position. A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increasein interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interestrates could have a negative effect on net interest income.     The Corporation is subject to interest rate risk because of the following factors:  Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. Forexample, if assets reprice slower than liabilities and interest ratesare generally rising, earnings may initially decline.   Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by differentamounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates isrising, we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that isless than the general increase in market interest rates because ofintense pricing competition. Also, basis risk occurs when assets andliabilities have similar repricing frequencies but are tied todifferent market interest rate indices that may not move in tandem.   Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by differentamounts, i.e., the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yieldsand funding costs differently.   The remaining maturity of various assets and liabilities may shortenor lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-termmortgage interest rates decline sharply, mortgage-backed securitiesheld in the securities available-for-sale portfolio may prepaysignificantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce portfolioincome. If prepayment rates increase, the Corporation would berequired to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period oftime, thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interestincome. Prepayment risk also has a significant impact onmortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations,since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of theseportfolios.   Interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand, creditlosses, loan origination volume, the value of securities holdings,including interest-only strips, gains and losses on sales ofsecurities and loans, the value of mortgage servicing rights and othersources of earnings.     In limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level, management may alter the mix offloating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities throughsales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among otheralternatives. The Corporation may suffer losses or experience lower spreads than anticipated ininitial projections as management implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.26Table of ContentsThe hedging transactions that the Corporation enters into may not be effective in managing theexposure to market risk, including interest rate risk.     The Corporation uses derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure tomarket risk caused by changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that theCorporation may utilize also have their own risks, which include: (1) basis risk, which is the riskof loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and/or hedgecost; (2) credit or default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of thecounterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations there under; and (3) legalrisk, which is the risk that the Corporation is unable to enforce certain terms of suchinstruments. All or any of such risks could expose the Corporation to losses.Reductions in the Corporations credit ratings or those of any of its subsidiaries would increasethe cost of borrowing funds and make the Corporations ability to raise new funds or renew maturingdebt more difficult.     Credit ratings are an important component of the Corporations liquidity profile. Among otherfactors, credit ratings are based on the financial strength, the credit quality of andconcentrations in the Corporations loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capitaladequacy, the quality of management, the liquidity of the Corporations balance sheet, theavailability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability toaccess a broad array of wholesale funding sources.     In December, 2007, Moodys Investor Service (Moodys) downgraded by one notch to A3, thesenior debt rating of the Corporation and reduced the short-term rating to P-2. The ratings wereput on watch negative. The funding challenges at the bank holding company as well as theprofitability of the U.S. business were given as the primary concerns underlying the downgrades. InJanuary, 2008, Moodys upgraded the ratings outlook to stable and removed the ratings watch whichhas been in effect. Initiatives completed by management to address the bank holding companiesfunding challenges were cited as prompting the change, although the profitability of the U.S.business continues to be a ratings concern.     After the end of the third quarter of 2007, Fitch Ratings reduced the short-term credit ratingof Popular, Inc. and Popular North America, Inc. to F-2 from F-1, and placed their long seniorrating of A- on negative rating watch. Fitch Ratings mentioned that the rating actions reflectedcredit quality pressures from our sub-prime loan exposure as well as a more difficult environmentfor bank holding company funding. In both cases, Fitch Ratings maintained that it believes thatboth situations are challenging but manageable. In January, 2008, Fitch Ratings announced that itwas affirming the Corporations senior debt rating at A- as well as removing the rating fromwatch negative. The outlook was maintained negative. Management actions related to bank holdingcompany liquidity were highlighted by the agency as underlying the removal of the watch, but U.S.business profitability concerns have kept the ratings outlook negative, until these challenges areresolved.     Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P) currently rates our debt BBB+ for long-term debtand A-2 for short-term obligations, both with a stable outlook.     Changes in the Corporations credit ratings or the credit ratings of any of its subsidiariesto a level below investment grade would adversely affect the Corporations ability to raise fundsin the capital markets. The Corporations counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of aratings downgrade. In the event of a downgrade, the cost of borrowing funds would increase. Inaddition, the Corporations ability to raise new funds in the capital markets or renew maturingdebt may be impaired.     The Corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits depends onvarious factors, including service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by theoperating results and credit ratings by nationally recognized credit agencies. A downgrade incredit ratings may impact the ability to raise deposits, but the Corporation believes that theimpact should not be material. Deposits at all of its banking subsidiaries are federally insured(subject to limitations established by the FDIC), which isexpected to mitigate the effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.27Table of ContentsA failure to comply with financial covenants in contractual agreements could accelerate payments ofrelated borrowings.     In the course of borrowing from institutional lenders and other investors, the Corporation hasentered into contractual agreements to maintain certain levels of debt, capital and asset quality,among other financial covenants. Failing to comply with those agreements may result in an event ofdefault, which could accelerate the repayment of the related borrowings. An event of default wouldalso affect the Corporations ability to raise new funds or renew maturing debt.The Corporation is subject to default risk in its loan portfolio.     The Corporation is subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures withrespect to the loans originated or acquired. The Corporation establishes provisions for loanlosses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowancefor future loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon anassessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures andguidelines. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of futureloan losses or that the Corporation will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in thefuture as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond itscontrol.The Corporation operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changesin federal and local laws and regulations.     The Corporation is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal andPuerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal or Puerto Rico laws orregulations could have a substantial impact on its operations. Additional laws and regulations maybe enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect the Corporations powers,authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financialcondition and results of operations. Further, regulators, in the performance of their supervisoryand enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe andunsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of thisregulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on the Corporation.Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporationsprofitability.     The Corporation faces substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits.The competition in originating loans comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico and foreignbanks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and otherinstitutional lenders and purchasers of loans. Certain of the Corporations competitors are notsubject to the same extensive regulation that governs the Corporations business.     The Corporation anticipates that it will encounter greater competition with the expansion ofits operations on the U.S. mainland. Many institutions with which the Corporation competes on theU.S. mainland have significantly greater assets, capital, name recognition, customer loyalty andother resources. As a result, certain of its competitors may have advantages in conducting certainbusinesses and providing certain services.     Increased competition could require that the Corporation increase the rates offered ondeposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect its profitability.Rating downgrades on the Government of Puerto Ricos debt obligations could affect the value of theCorporations loans to the Government and its portfolio of Puerto Rico Government securities.     Even though Puerto Ricos economy is closely integrated to that of the U.S. mainland and itsgovernment and many of its instrumentalities are investment grade-rated borrowers in the U.S.capital28Table of Contentsmarkets, the fiscal situation of the Government of Puerto Rico has led nationally recognizedrating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations.     As a result of the Governments fiscal challenges in 2006, Moodys and S&P then downgraded therating of its obligations, but maintaining them within investment-grade levels. Since then, actionsby the Government have improved the credit outlook. As of December 31, 2007, S&P rated theGovernments general obligations at BBB-, while Moodys rated them at Baa3- both in the lowest notchof investment grade. In November 2007, Moodys upgraded the outlook of the Commonwealths creditratings to stable from negative In justifying their change in outlook, Moodys recognized theprogress the Commonwealth has made in addressing the fiscal challenges it has faced in recentyears. In particular it mentioned the controls imposed on public spending and the implementation ofthe sales tax as two favorable developments.     Factors such as the governments ability to implement meaningful steps to curb operatingexpenditures, improve managerial and budgetary controls, and eliminate the governments reliance onoperating budget loans from the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico will be key determinantsof future ratings stability. Also, the inability to agree on future fiscal year Commonwealthbudgets could result in ratings pressure from the rating agencies.     It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgradein Puerto Ricos debt obligations. However, a deterioration in the fiscal situation with possiblenegative ratings implications, could adversely affect the value of Puerto Ricos Governmentobligations.     A substantial portion of the Corporations credit exposure to the Government of Puerto Rico iseither collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenuesidentified for their repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loansto public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such aswater and electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence fromthe central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from the centralGovernment. The Corporation also has loans to various municipalities for which the good faith,credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has been pledged to theirrepayment. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amountsas shall be required for the payment of all of its general obligation bonds and loans. Anotherportion of these loans consist of special obligations of various municipalities that are payablefrom the basic real and personal property taxes collected within such municipalities. The full goodfaith and credit obligations of the municipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.     AtDecember 31, 2007, the Corporation had $1.0 billion of credit facilities granted to orguaranteed by the P.R. Government and its political subdivisions, of which $150 million areuncommitted lines of credit. Of these total credit facilitiesgranted, $914 million in loans wereoutstanding at December 31, 2007. A substantial portion of the credit exposure to the Government ofPuerto Rico has an identified repayment stream, which includes in some cases the good faith, creditand unlimited taxation power of certain municipalities and, an assignment of basic property taxesand other revenues.     Furthermore, as of December 31, 2007, the Corporation had outstanding $178 million inObligations of Puerto Rico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of its investment portfolio.Of that portfolio, $55 million was in the form of Puerto Rico Commonwealths Appropriation Bonds,which are currently rated Ba1, one notch below investment grade, by Moodys and BBB-, the lowestinvestment grade rating, by S&P, another nationally recognized credit rating agency. AtDecember 31, 2007, the Appropriation Bonds indicated above represented approximately $1.8 millionin unrealized losses in the Corporations portfolio of investment securities available- for- sale.The Corporation is closely monitoring the political and economic situation of the Island andevaluates the portfolio for any declines in value that management may consider being other- than-temporary. Management has the intent and ability to hold these investments for a reasonable periodof time or up to maturity for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) the cost ofthese investments.29Table of ContentsOur income tax provision and other tax liabilities may be insufficient if taxing authorities aresuccessful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our position. Additionally, continuedloss from operations in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowanceagainst our deferred tax assets.     From time to time, we are audited by various federal, state and local authorities regardingincome tax matters. Significant judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxesand our liabilities for federal, state, local and other taxes. Our audits are in various stages ofcompletion; however, no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior tothe conclusion of the audit, appeal and, in some cases, litigation process. Although we believe ourapproach to determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance withStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and FASBInterpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, it is possible that the finaltax authority will take a tax position that is materially different than that which is reflected inour income tax provision and other tax reserves. As each audit is conducted, adjustments, if any,are appropriately recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period determined. Suchdifferences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision or benefit, or othertax reserves, in the reporting period in which such determination is made and, consequently, on ourresults of operations, financial position and/or cash flows for such period.     Our deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight ofavailable evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assetswill not be realized. In determining the more-likely-than-not criterion, we evaluate all positiveand negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments, either increasesor decreases, to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be determined based upon changesin the expected realization of our net deferred tax assets. The realization of our deferred taxassets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback orcarryforward periods under the tax law. Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing thevaluation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonablypossible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in futurereporting periods. Our results of operations would be impacted negatively if we determine thatincreases to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance are required in a future reporting period.Certain of the provisions contained in the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation have theeffect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board ofDirectors less responsive to stockholder control.     The Corporations certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board ofDirectors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting ofstockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-yearterm, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore,control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetingsmust be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. TheCorporations certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board ofDirectors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds ofthe combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election ofdirectors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board ofDirectors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. Theseprovisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire the Corporation becauseof the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result,may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capitalstock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer forthe Corporations capital stock.30Table of ContentsPreferred rights issued under the Corporations Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement may have ananti-takeover effect.     Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to a preferred right to purchase theCorporations Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock in certain circumstances.

A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increasein interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interestrates could have a negative effect on net interest income.The Corporation is subject to interest rate risk because of the following factors:  Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice atdifferent times. For example, if assets reprice slowerthan liabilities and interest rates are generallyrising, earnings may initially decline.   Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but bydifferent amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates isrising, we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that is less thanthe general increase in market interest rates because of intense pricingcompetition. Also, basis risk occurs when assets and liabilities have similarrepricing frequencies but are tied to different market interest rate indices.   Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change bydifferent amounts, i.e., the shape of the yield curve may affect new loanyields and funding costs differently.   The remaining maturity of various assets and liabilitiesmay shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, iflong-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, mortgage-backedsecurities held in the securities available-for-sale portfolio mayprepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduceportfolio income. If prepayment rates increase, the Corporationwould be required to amortize net premiums into income over ashorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding assetyield and net interest income. Prepayment risk also has asignificant impact on mortgage-backed securities and collateralizedmortgage obligations, since prepayments could shorten the weightedaverage life of these portfolios.   Interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand, creditlosses, loan origination volume, the value of securities holdings, includinginterest-only strips, gains and losses on sales of securities and loans, thevalue of mortgage servicing rights and other sources of earnings.17Table of Contents     In limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level, management may alter the mix offloating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities throughsales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other alternatives. TheCorporation may suffer losses or experience lower spreads than anticipated in initial projectionsas management implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.The hedging transactions that the Corporation enters into may not be effective in managing theexposure to market risk, including interest rate risk.     The Corporation uses derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure tomarket risk caused by changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that theCorporation may utilize also have their own risks, which include: (1) basis risk, which is the riskof loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and/or hedgecost; (2) credit or default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of thecounterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder; and (3) legal risk,which is the risk that the Corporation is unable to enforce certain terms of such instruments. Allor any of such risks could expose the Corporation to losses.Reductions in the Corporations credit ratings or those of any of its subsidiaries wouldincrease the cost of borrowing funds and make the Corporations ability to raise new funds or renewmaturing debt more difficult.     Credit ratings are an important component of the Corporations liquidity profile. Amongother factors, credit ratings are based on the financial strength, the credit quality of andconcentrations in the Corporations loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capitaladequacy, the quality of management, the liquidity of the Corporations balance sheet, theavailability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability toaccess a broad array of wholesale funding sources. Changes in the Corporations credit ratings orthe credit ratings of any of its subsidiaries to a level below investment grade would adverselyaffect the Corporations ability to raise funds in the capital markets. The Corporationscounterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade. In the event of a downgrade,the cost of borrowing funds would increase. In addition, the Corporations ability to raise newfunds in the capital markets or renew maturing debt may be more difficult.     The Corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits dependson various factors, including service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by theoperating results and credit ratings by nationally recognized credit agencies. A downgrade incredit ratings may impact the ability to raise deposits, but the Corporation believes that theimpact should not be material. Deposits at all of its banking subsidiaries are federally insured(subject to limitations established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), which isexpected to mitigate the effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.A failure to comply with financial covenants in contractual agreements could acceleratepayments of related borrowings.     In the course of borrowing from institutional lenders and other investors, theCorporation has entered into contractual agreements to maintain certain levels of debt, capital andasset quality, among other financial covenants. Failing to comply with those agreements may resultin an event of default, which could accelerate the repayment of the related borrowings. An event ofdefault would also affect the Corporations ability to raise new funds or renew maturing debt.The Corporation is subject to default risk in its loan portfolio.     The Corporation is subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures withrespect to the loans originated or acquired. The Corporation establishes provisions for loanlosses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowancefor future loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon anassessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures andguidelines. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of futureloan losses or that the Corporation will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in thefuture as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond itscontrol.18Table of ContentsA prolonged economic downturn or recession would likely result in an increase indelinquencies, defaults and foreclosures and in a reduction of the loan origination activity whichwould adversely affect the Corporations financial results.     A period of reduced economic growth or a recession has historically resulted in areduction in lending activity and an increase in the rate of defaults in commercial loans, consumerloans and residential mortgages. A recession may have a significant adverse impact on the netinterest income and fee income. The Corporation may also experience significant losses on the loanportfolio due to a higher level of defaults on commercial loans, consumer loans and residentialmortgages.The Corporation operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected bychanges in federal and local laws and regulations.     The Corporation is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination byfederal and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal or Puerto Rico lawsor regulations could have a substantial impact on its operations. Additional laws and regulationsmay be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect the Corporations powers,authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financialcondition and results of operations. Further, regulators, in the performance of their supervisoryand enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe andunsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of thisregulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on the Corporation.Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporationsprofitability.     The Corporation faces substantial competition in originating loans and in attractingdeposits. The competition in originating loans comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico andforeign banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies andother institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. Certain of the Corporations competitors arenot subject to the same extensive regulation that governs the Corporations business.     The Corporation anticipates that it will encounter greater competition with the expansionof its operations on the U.S. mainland. Many institutions with which the Corporation competes onthe U.S. mainland have significantly greater assets, capital, name recognition, customer loyaltyand other resources. As a result, certain of its competitors may have advantages in conductingcertain businesses and providing certain services.     Increased competition could require that the Corporation increase the rates offered ondeposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect its profitability.The Corporation is exposed to greater risk because a significant portion of the business isconcentrated in Puerto Rico, which was experienced an economic slowdown.     A significant portion of the Corporations financial activities and credit exposure areconcentrated in Puerto Rico. Consequently, the financial condition and results of operations arehighly dependent on economic conditions in Puerto Rico. An extended economic slowdown in PuertoRico, adverse political or economic developments in Puerto Rico or natural disasters, such ashurricanes, affecting Puerto Rico could result in a downturn in loan originations, an increase inthe level of nonperforming assets, an increase in the rate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loansand a reduction in the value of the Corporations loans and loan servicing portfolio, all of whichwould adversely affect the Corporations profitability.     Although official statistics are not yet available, it is probable that the PuertoRico economy ended 2006 in recession. It is estimated that the economy started contracting in thefirst quarter of 2006.     For the first time since 2002, manufacturing has shown an outright decline in overall activityup to 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005. The trend worsened somewhat as the semesterprogressed, but appeared to be leveling off towards the end.     Construction remained relatively weak during the first three quarters of 2006, as thecombination of rising interest rates, the Commonwealths fiscal situation and decreasing publicinvestment in19Table of Contentsconstruction projects affected the sector. However, it did manage to expand verymodestly vs. the prior-year period. The value of construction permits during the first threequarters of 2006 declined 9.4%, with most of the drop coming from the public sector. Retail salesduring the same period also reflected theuncertainty prevalent at the time related to the Commonwealths fiscal situation, as well asincreased oil and utility prices. Sales registered a decline of 1.8% as compared to the same periodin 2005, as the months surrounding a temporary government shutdown, due to budgetary deficits, wereparticularly affected. The unemployment rate, after spiking temporarily to almost 20% in May as aresult of the shutdown, has declined to 9.7% as of September 2006.     Tourism is the one sector that has been resilient. Activity in the sector has expandedconsistently since 2004, and in the year ending June 2006 it registered the strongest increase infour years. Factors that may be boosting the tourism sector are geo-political tensions throughoutthe world, a relative benign hurricane season for the past two years, and a relatively solid U.S.economy.     In general it is apparent that in 2006 the P.R. economy entered a recession, primarily due toweaker manufacturing, softer consumption and decreased government investment in construction.     The above economic concerns and uncertainty in the private and public sectors may also have anadverse effect in the credit quality of the Corporations loan portfolios, as delinquency rates mayincrease in the short-term, until the economy stabilizes. Also, a potential reduction in consumerspending may also impact growth in other interest and non-interest revenue sources of theCorporation.The Corporation is unable to predict what adverse consequences, if any, or other effectstransactions with Doral Financial Corporation or R&G Financial Corporation, the civil litigationrelated to Doral or R&G matters or the related investigations could have on the Corporation.     Aspreviously mentioned on page 17, under Item 1. Business, Doral Financial Corporation (Doral) has announced investigations by the SEC and theU.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York and R&G Financial Corporation (R&G)has announced an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Corporation has haddealings with both Doral and R&G and has provided information in connection with, and is continuingto cooperate with, certain of the investigations of these matters. The Corporation is unable topredict what adverse consequences, if any, or other effects dealings with Doral or R&G, the civillitigation related to Doral or R&G matters or the related investigations could have on theCorporation.Certain of the provisions contained in the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation have theeffect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board ofDirectors less responsive to stockholder control.     The Corporations certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board ofDirectors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting ofstockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-yearterm, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore,control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetingsmust be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. TheCorporations certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board ofDirectors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds ofthe combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election ofdirectors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board ofDirectors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. Theseprovisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire the Corporation becauseof the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result,may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capitalstock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer forthe Corporations capital stock.Preferred rights issued under the Corporations Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement mayhave an anti-takeover effect.     Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to a preferred right to purchase theCorporations Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock in certain circumstances. Preferredrights become exercisable if a person or group has acquired 10% or more of the shares of commonstock or a20Table of Contentstender or exchange offer is commenced which, if consummated, would result in a personbecoming the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the common stock. The preferred rights may bedeemed to have ananti-takeover effect and generally may cause substantial dilution to a person or group thatattempts to acquire the Corporation under circumstances not approved by the Board of Directors.Rating downgrades on the Government of Puerto Ricos debt obligations could affect the valueof the Corporations loans to the Government and its portfolio of Puerto Rico GovernmentSecurities.     Even though Puerto Ricos economy is closely integrated to that of the U.S. mainland and itsgovernment and many of its instrumentalities are investment-grade rated borrowers in the U.S.capital markets, the current fiscal situation of the Government of Puerto Rico has led nationallyrecognized rating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations.     In May 2006, Moodys Investors Service downgraded the Governments general obligation bondrating to Baa3 from Baa2, and put the credit on watch list for possible further downgrades. TheCommonwealths appropriation bonds and some of the subordinated revenue bonds were also downgradedby one notch and are now rated just below investment grade at Ba1. Standard & Poors RatingServices (S&P) still rates the Governments general obligations two notches above junk at BBB,and the Commonwealths appropriation bonds and some of the subordinated revenue bonds BBB-, acategory that continues to be investment-grade rated.     In July 2006, S&P and Moodys affirmed their credit ratings on the Commonwealth debt, andremoved the debt from their respective watch lists, thus reducing the possibility of an immediateadditional downgrade. These actions resulted after the Government approved the budget for thefiscal year 2007, which runs from July 2006 through June 2007, which included the adoption of a newsales tax. Revenues from the sales tax will be dedicated primarily to fund the governmentsoperating expenses, and to a lesser extent, to repay government debt and fund local municipalgovernments.     Both rating agencies maintained the negative outlook for the Puerto Rico obligation bonds.Factors such as the governments ability to implement meaningful steps to curb operatingexpenditures, improve managerial and budgetary controls, and eliminate the governments reliance onoperating budget loans from the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico will be key determinantsof future rating stability and restoration of a stable long-term outlook. Also, the inability toagree on future fiscal year Commonwealth budgets could result in ratings pressure from the ratingagencies.     It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgradein Puerto Ricos debt obligations. However, the fallout from recent budgetary crisis and a possibleratings downgrade could adversely affect the value of Puerto Ricos Government obligations.     Asubstantial portion of the Corporations credit exposure to theGovernment of Puerto Rico is either collateralized loans orobligations that have a specific source of income or revenuesidentified for their repayment. Some of these obligations consist ofsenior and subordinated loans to public corporations that obtainrevenues from rates charged for services or products, such as waterand electric power utilities. Public corporations have varyingdegrees of independence from the central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from the central Government. The Corporationalso has loans to various municipalities for which the good faith, credit andunlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has beenpledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required by lawto levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be requiredfor the payment of all of its general obligation bonds and loans.Another portion of these loans consist of special obligations ofvarious municipalities that are payable from the basic real andpersonal property taxes collected within suchmunicipalities. The full good faith and credit obligations of themunicipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.     AtDecember 31, 2006, the Corporation had $901 million of credit facilities granted to orguaranteed by the P.R. Government and its political subdivisions, of which $50 million areuncommitted lines of credit. Of these total credit facilitiesgranted, $735 million in loans wereoutstanding at December 31, 2006. A substantial portion of the credit exposure to the Government ofPuerto Rico has an identified repayment stream, which includes in some cases the good faith, creditand unlimited taxation power of certain municipalities and, an assignment of basic property taxesand other revenues.     Furthermore, as of December 31, 2006, the Corporation had outstanding $187 million inObligations of Puerto Rico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of its investment portfolio.Of that total, $164 million is exposed to the creditworthiness of the P.R. Government and itsmunicipalities. Of that portfolio, $58 million are in the form of Puerto Rico CommonwealthsAppropriation Bonds, which are21Table of Contentscurrently rated Ba1, one notch below investment grade, by Moodysand BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating, by Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P), anothernationally recognized credit ratingagency. At December 31, 2006, the Appropriation Bonds indicated above represented approximately$3.0 million in unrealized losses in the Corporations portfolio of investment securitiesavailable- for- sale. The Corporation is closely monitoring the political and economic situation ofthe Island and evaluates the portfolio for any declines in value that management may consider beingother- than- temporary. Management has the intent and ability to hold these investments for areasonable period of time or up to maturity for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to (orbeyond) the cost of these investments.A prolonged economic slowdown or a decline in the real estate market in the U.S mainland could harmthe results of operations of one of the Corporations business segments     The residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoyingperiods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes andindustry-wide losses. Any decline in residential mortgage loan originations in the market couldalso reduce the level of mortgage loans the Corporation may produce in the future and adverselyimpact its business. During periods of rising interest rates, refinancing originations for manymortgage products tend to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance theirexisting mortgage loans are reduced. In addition, the residential mortgage loan originationbusiness is impacted by home values. Over the past several years, residential real estate values insome areas of the U.S. mainland have increased greatly, which has contributed to the recent rapidgrowth in the residential mortgage industry, particularly with respect to refinancings. Ifresidential real estate values decline, this could lead to lower volumes and higher losses acrossthe industry, adversely impacting the Corporations business.     Because the Corporation makes a substantial number of loans to credit-impaired borrowersthrough its subsidiary PFH, the actual rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on theseloans could be higher during economic slowdowns. Rising unemployment, higher interest rates ordeclines in housing prices tend to have a greater negative effect on the ability of such borrowersto repay their mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 71% of PFHs mortgage loanportfolio was non-prime, meaning that they have a credit score of 660 or below. This representedapproximately 44% of the Corporations mortgage loan portfolio as of such date. Any sustainedperiod of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could harm the Corporations ability tosell loans, the prices it receives for its loans, the values of its mortgage loans held-for-sale orits residual interests in securitizations, which could harm the Corporations financial conditionand results of operations. In addition, any material decline in real estate values would weaken theCorporations collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrowerdefaults. In such event, the Corporation will be subject to the risk of loss on such mortgageassets arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered by third-party credit enhancement.     For further information of other risks faced by the Corporation please refer to the MD&Asection of the Annual Report"
12,BPOP,POPULAR INC,2006-03-15,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSFinancial results are constantly exposed to market risk.     Market risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the marketvalue of assets and liabilities due to interest rate volatility. Despite the varied nature ofmarket risks, the primary source of this risk to the Corporation is the impact of changes ininterest rates on net interest income.     Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on earning assets andthe interest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristicsof the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could eitherincrease or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structureof the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities matureor reprice in that period. Any mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilitiesis known as a gap position. A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increasein interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interestrates could have a negative effect on net interest income.The Corporation is subject to interest rate risk because of the following factors:  Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice atdifferent times. For example, if assets reprice slowerthan liabilities and interest rates are generallyrising, earnings may initially decline.   Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but bydifferent amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates isrising, we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that is less thanthe general increase in market interest rates because of intense pricingcompetition. Also, basis risk occurs when assets and liabilities have similarrepricing frequencies but are tied to different market interest rate indices.   Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change bydifferent amounts, i.e., the shape of the yield curve may affect new loanyields and funding costs differently.   The remaining maturity of various assets and liabilitiesmay shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, iflong-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, mortgage-backedsecurities held in the securities available-for-sale portfolio mayprepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduceportfolio income. If prepayment rates increase, the Corporationwould be required to amortize net premiums into income over ashorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding assetyield and net interest income. Prepayment risk also has asignificant impact on mortgage-backed securities and collateralizedmortgage obligations, since prepayments could shorten the weightedaverage life of these portfolios.   Interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand, creditlosses, loan origination volume, the value of securities holdings, includinginterest-only strips, gains and losses on sales of securities and loans, thevalue of mortgage servicing rights and other sources of earnings.     In the Corporations liability sensitive position means that its short-term borrowingsand, to a lesser extent, interest-bearing deposits typically reprice faster that the adjustablerate assets. As a result,16Table of Contentsincreases in short-term interest rates could reduce net interest income. Also, if the flatteningslope of the yield curve and current interest rate conditions persist, coupled with intense pricingcompetition, the net interest margin could be negatively impacted.     In limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level, management may alter the mix offloating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities throughsales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among otheralternatives. The Corporation may suffer losses or experience lower spreads than anticipated ininitial projections as management implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.The hedging transactions that the Corporation enters into may not be effective in managing theexposure to market risk, including interest rate risk.     The Corporation uses derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure tomarket risk caused by changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that theCorporation may utilize also have their own risks, which include: (1) basis risk, which is the riskof loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and/or hedgecost; (2) credit or default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of thecounterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder; and (3) legal risk,which is the risk that the Corporation is unable to enforce certain terms of such instruments. Allor any of such risks could expose the Corporation to losses.Reductions in the Corporations credit ratings or those of any of its subsidiaries wouldincrease the cost of borrowing funds and make the Corporations ability to raise new funds or renewmaturing debt more difficult.     Credit ratings are an important component of the Corporations liquidity profile. Amongother factors, credit ratings are based on the financial strength, the credit quality of andconcentrations in the Corporations loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capitaladequacy, the quality of management, the liquidity of the Corporations balance sheet, theavailability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability toaccess a broad array of wholesale funding sources. Changes in the Corporations credit ratings orthe credit ratings of any of its subsidiaries to a level below investment grade would adverselyaffect the Corporations ability to raise funds in the capital markets. The Corporationscounterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade. In the event of a downgrade,the cost of borrowing funds would increase. In addition, the Corporations ability to raise newfunds in the capital markets or renew maturing debt may be more difficult.     The Corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits dependson various factors, including service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by theoperating results and credit ratings by nationally recognized credit agencies. A downgrade incredit ratings may impact the ability to raise deposits, but the Corporation believes that theimpact should not be material. Deposits at all of its banking subsidiaries are federally insured(subject to limitations established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), which isexpected to mitigate the effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.     Some of the Corporations borrowings and deposits are subject to rating triggers, whichare contractual provisions that accelerate the maturity of the underlying obligations in the caseof a change in the ratings. Therefore, the need to raise funds in the marketplace could increase inthe case of a ratings downgrade. As of December 31, 2005, the Corporation had outstanding $216million of borrowings subject to rating triggers.A failure to comply with financial covenants in contractual agreements could acceleratepayments of related borrowings.     In the course of borrowing from institutional lenders and other investors, theCorporation has entered into contractual agreements to maintain certain levels of debt, capital andasset quality, among other financial covenants. Failing to comply with those agreements may resultin an event of default, which could accelerate the repayment of the related borrowings. An event ofdefault would also affect the Corporations ability to raise new funds or renew maturing debt.17Table of ContentsThe Corporation is subject to default risk in its loan portfolio.     The Corporation is subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures withrespect to the loans originated or acquired.
